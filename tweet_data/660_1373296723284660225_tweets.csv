I'm not saying democracy is right or wrong btw. It's all personal choice, no political ideology has worked too well for the masses so far let's be honest."
22,"@Ryan_Dale_III @keepfischin @ABigThingBadly @7theyeETH For me at least it really boils down to this:
Do you want your politicians to have power over you or do you want power of your politicians?

What if same government shut down people in this way over protesting something you do agree with?"
