‘Soon’ I expect as always."
24,"@CryptoMag13 @OMI_VeVe @ihates0ciety @ecomi_rhys You’re confusing gochain and ETH chains ,it’s about layer 1 and layer  2 on ETH."
25,"@CryptoMag13 @OMI_VeVe @ihates0ciety No, I’m fully aware of gems, OMI difference.
I have OMI on VeVe , which is trapped as it’s on layer 2, you can’t send layer 2 tokens to a layer 1 wallet address , hence why I can’t move it to an exchange it needs to be bridged to layer 1 , but there is no bridge"
26,"@CryptoMag13 @OMI_VeVe You’ve had a shocker there, it’s trapped in VeVe , so tell me how to get it to that exchange ?"
27,"@OMI_VeVe_OG1 Morons, paperhands, FUD, HODL, it’s actually good I can’t spend my own tokens ok got it!👍"
28,@johnsavage_eth A way to get $OMI out of the app would be helpful

Also, I thinking minting a lot will be it’s own reward anyway, you’ll hopefully look back and wish you minted even more ! 
I love this project , it is so inventive and moves so fast so fingers crossed WAGMI"

Guess I’ll have to just wait for them to sort it ‘soon’. 🤣"

Had I known they’re would of been no way I would of sent it to VeVe"
55,"@SirHapness @shakester2010 @mattyboy8393 @ecomi_ I never saw anything saying that, could you point me to where they said that? if they did then my bad, but I can’t recall them ever saying that."
56,"@shakester2010 @SirHapness @mattyboy8393 @ecomi_ Dunno about illegal Well it’s definitely not ideal, it needs sorting like yesterday , can’t believe there is no way to get it out , no way they should of allowed OMI into VeVe without a way to get it out."
