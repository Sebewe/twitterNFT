33,@willmiller050 @Collectparticle Because @Collectparticle is good at marketing and 99% of their buyers are folks who don't bother to read the small print and just hear Banksy and think they own the original actually.

39,@willmiller050 @Collectparticle Cause they aren't. The Particle Foundation owns the original art 100%. The Particle NFT holders just own digital pieces that represent the original art and won't profit from future sales either. Clever marketing @Collectparticle 👏🏼

- focusing only on Discord on minting communication, which is messy for newbies
- shortening the purchasing window during a crypto 🐻 market to just 24h will actually put more pressure on already confused and cash-strapped buyers

We'll see, but I have my doubts... 🤨"
52,"@Collectparticle 1/2 The reason why you haven't minted as many particles as you've hoped for are:
-  the current crypto bloodbath, not much liquidity left for many potential purchasers 
- your complex Avax purchasing process
- your messed up email WL process that left many eligible folks out"
