50,@CheerUpHumanity @LooksRareNFT Yeah agree!
51,@holly_longoria Can't wait to see what's coming next for DeadFellaz 👀
52,@CheerUpHumanity @LooksRareNFT Yeah I agree but I just explained why there is such drastic difference in the floor value not that I want to remove the ape from circulation but just wanted to let others know that something is off about it before they jump into buying it!
53,"@evantan Congrats on the sale, @nftworldsNFT probably 👀"
54,@screentimes @HempCasuals @LooksRareNFT No I wouldn't even if it is 50 ETH below the floor also!
55,"@HempCasuals @LooksRareNFT If it is a stolen Ape, no point in filling the pocket of an hacker with ETH"
56,"@LooksRareNFT Looks like that ape is marked for suspicious activity on Opensea, looks like the hacker is trying to sell it for cheap on your exchange"
