25,@mark_is_markus Thanks for engaging in discourse!
26,"To find out and read about my thoughts, check out my piece “The End of History and the Philosophy of Crypto.” https://t.co/DSwIt8wYhy"
27,"A forked path lies ahead: one road lies the web3 revolution, and the enlightened, freed, and transcendent sovereign—“gods of myth.” The other Artificial intelligence-enabled faked decentralization backed by totalitarian regimes and technocratic monopolies. How will we choose?"
28,"DeFi, DAOs, and NFTs are all part of a Fichtean struggle driving a dialectical evolution that gives birth to the end of history. I believe Hegel’s vision is rational: he envisions a world where life became democratized, permissionless, transparent, and decentralized. Crypto."
29,"With a new technological framework that enables reimplementation of an intelligently designed capitalistic system, how should we adopt the future? We turn to philosophy because crypto needs philosophy. Values need to be more than tokenized—they must be redefined and imposed."
