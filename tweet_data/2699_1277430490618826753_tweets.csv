35,"When I heard that @roboshima and @BenTopkins were building a team to make games in web3 I knew I wanted to get involved.

They have a track record of making building great games!

No better way to make great games than by having world-class game devs entering the ecosystem.

🧵(4/6)"
37,"There is a beautiful feeling of camaraderie within web3 gaming communities that I haven't seen anywhere else.

Everyone supports each other at every corner, anything from onboarding to building, it's a by-product of owning your own game assets.
