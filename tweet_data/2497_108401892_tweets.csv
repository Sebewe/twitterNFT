62,"why should BAYC holders have all the fun? Q+K holders can create stories for their royals as well… looks to me like this royal is on their way to a masquerade ball, where they plan to reveal their true self and assume sovereign rule of the grape realm! 🍇 👑 #hacktheroyals https://t.co/lt1NiILVFu"

69,"a legal dispute i am following closely, esp. after being at @NFT_NYC for the announcement! tricky contract interpretation issues here in addition to IP… https://t.co/uabpDQE4Hv"
70,"@mokalache @opensea we should, however, expect to see this become a larger issue in the context of source of funds — regulatory exceptions potentially applicable to creative work-product would not reasonably apply to *purchasers* of NFTs located in a sanctioned country"
71,@mokalache @opensea the “wide net” of sanctions policy is not a new issue for creatives — has been relevant in the trad art / decorative collectibles market for some time (e.g. with respect to persian textiles)
72,"@mokalache @opensea with respect specifically to creators (i.e. individuals in sanctioned countries authoring creative works linked to NFTs), it will be interesting to see whether regulatory exceptions for “informational materials” may be a relevant exception…"
73,@mokalache @opensea totally understand that US federal sanctions policy may feel unfair as it lumps everyone from a sanctioned country into the same bucket of “nope.” but doing biz with a DoT/OFAC-listed person/entity is a violation of federal law that can come with criminal penalties…
74,loved seeing @mccoyspace and @slimesunday recognized in this @artnet piece alongside other OG artists working with NFTs… such a privilege to support these guys 🥰 https://t.co/Yq8iE2pdLU

77,things we will see more of in 2022: mainstream device NFT integration (e.g. new samsung TVs: https://t.co/ZJCQkyHro8). that question i’ve publicly posed about ©️ sec. 109 rights and gap-filler project licensing terms? not going away.
