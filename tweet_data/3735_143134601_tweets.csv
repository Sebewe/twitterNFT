0,"@moxie Moxie, I respect you for protecting your friend.

But this is something I know a non-zero amount about (even if it’s not in my “bio.”)

I have taken great risk, on multiple occasions. And in multiple ways. Happy to talk offline."
1,"@shenkin Shocking, I know."
2,@random_walk I agree. Unfortunately most don’t see it.
3,"@2wiceB I deployed to Afghanistan serving America and saw people get shot and killed and also blown up

(For one thing)"
4,@SaketRKumar Or he was a Russian asset from the beginning which the last few weeks makes even more likely
5,"@CJHandmer Hard disagree. Go back two weeks. He was aggressively saying there will be no invasion (one tweet of many)

Unfortunately some people still trust him so there might have even been some Ukrainians who stayed because of his misplaced confidence https://t.co/gLpEoX2BIm"
6,@Snowden Either you’ve suddenly lost your courage or you were an asset from the beginning. The latter seeming more and more likely.
7,@bobbyfijan Agree
8,@misha_saul That is very obvious misdirection. He’s using a red herring to avoid condemning Putin. He is constantly on Twitter criticizing the West for every misstep. And now when it really matters — granted when the stakes are simultaneously much higher for him — he’s silent.
9,"How do people not see right through this guy?

After nearly a week without condemning his host, all we get is this tweet condemning his trolls.

Either he suddenly lost his courage or he was owned from the very beginning. https://t.co/AaqiYFwNuv"
10,"@jsrailton @signalapp You literally just spread a rumor that Starlink compromises user locations

Hint: it doesn't"
11,@acidshill If you’ve absorbed any history at all it’s obvious why this is important
12,The West needs to increase the cost of escalation for Putin. Set some red lines and stick to them. Use of chemical or thermobaric weapons is an obvious red line. Get off your asses leaders.
13,@selfsearching We shall see
14,@sarthakgh Couldn’t agree more. One of the most impressive leaders in the modern era.
15,@nick_farina Amen
16,@GunjitSingh13 Tragically yes. Freedom has a high cost. The West has forgotten this.
17,@GunjitSingh13 Yes it may take many years to get there
18,"@GunjitSingh13 Russian forces leaving Ukraine, Ukraine being left with full sovereignty, and Zelensky or one of his disciples being President."
19,@tomschuIz &gt;50% at this point. The only way they lose is by giving up.
20,"The longer this war goes on, the more Ukraine's odds of winning go up 🇺🇦"
21,@michellebailhe @ZelenskyyUa Couldn’t agree more!
22,@PaulJoeyPowers 😢
23,@Basti Legend
24,@Basti @dwr They are the absolute best!!! We have a 5 week old baby so didn’t play this round but @darkforest_eth is the most fun I’ve had in years 👀 @gubsheep
25,Dear @FAANews you might want to cut the red tape and let @SpaceX start testing Starship… 🙏 https://t.co/QYu6PQzoaB
26,"RT @usleepwalker: My Ukrainian credit cards don't work anymore. I'm safe physically in Kazakhstan, but all my savings are gone.

Crypto is…"
27,"@migardan The bar is very low, but most politicians don’t even make it"
28,"I never voted for this man l, and it’s sad I need to lead with that, but it’s worth watching this video. The world is rarely black and white. 

In order for the Western agenda to survive we need to move beyond tribalism and think about each specific issue. https://t.co/R1EgDxYi6Q"
29,"@boysattheirbest I said ""deterrent""! 

Clearly the threat of sanctions, which the West made extremely clear up front, didn't deter Russia from partaking on the largest full scale assault of a Western nation in at least the last 30 years."
30,Heartbreaking. You’ve got this 🇺🇦. https://t.co/reMovTvebQ
31,This is an incredibly important PSA https://t.co/4bOcUNHCq0
32,"@grrosegr Did they deter Russia? I used the word *deter*. 

But also, prediction: the sanctions will be completely irrelevant in a year"
33,@nikitabier I’m so sorry man.
34,@hdubugras @HarryStebbings Couldn't agree more! LA is home!
35,"@FAANews @SpaceX Dear FAA, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt that you’re doing the best you can, but you’re holding back one of the most important technologies of the century."
36,@zalzally @drewvolpe Embarrassing.
37,@US_China_Menu @fncischen Agree
38,"@mimi_aboubaker @ScottAbookire I agree with all this. Well said.

That said, I think it's very hard to use crypto for large scale money laundering / sanctions avoidance as we've seen by the ability to recover funds or trace funds in many situations, such as the colonial pipeline or most recently bitfinex"
39,"@drewvolpe The threat was made extremely clear, and clearly it wasn't a deterrent."
40,@drewvolpe clearly not very much
41,@borgesjl777 and Russians will be able to buy whatever goods they want routed through China
42,"@borgesjl777 I agree with you. But I think both with goods and $, Russia considers China its most important trade partner going forwards, which has profound impacts in terms of the game they intend to play"
43,@DrStarson Completely agree
44,@ScottAbookire Crypto will help in the long run not the short run
45,"@pfau @WillManidis And ""Russia"" is not ""Russia""... it's ""Russia + China"""
46,"@pfau @WillManidis Germany is absolutely pwned by Russia and China my dude

Owned by Russia's natural gas and components + materials from China which they rely on for their ""exports"""
47,@WillManidis say more?
48,"Western sanctions don't mean what they used to

The West is no longer the production engine of the world, it's the consumption engine

This needs to be a powerful wake up call that sanctions alone are no longer a deterrent (as we've already seen for years in NK and others)"
49,"for*

Was literally at a mass for words"
50,I’m at a loss of words 🇺🇦
51,"@mjwenger1 The World Cup qualifying this year isn’t fair to players: fly from Europe to the US, play 3, then back to Europe for a fully club schedule, all in a week. Brutal."
52,"@Mira404 @CyrilGrislain And going in the other direction was something that helped me instantly fall in love with @LianaKadisha who speaks: English, Spanish, Farsi, Hebrew, Mandarin; and then some French 😍"
53,@quantumVerd @balajis This is huge! The USA is lucky to have you.
54,"@zmanian @tarunchitra @Music109025311 @dystopiabreaker Just as a thought experiment, imagine thinking about detecting gravitational waves 100 years ago. Displacements 3 orders of magnitude less than the average distance between a proton and an electron in a hydrogen atom. 100 years is a long time

&amp; there are strong incentives for QC"
55,@tarunchitra @zmanian @Music109025311 @dystopiabreaker Partially why I’m bullish on ions or photonics compared to superconducting platforms.
56,"@tarunchitra @Music109025311 @zmanian @dystopiabreaker Discrete log on the level it breaks RSA seems likely within 20 years, if not closer to 10 years. Quantum more broadly is a top defense priority for both US and China. This compresses timescales

TQC within 100 years for sure"
57,@chad_alt I agree with everything in thread up until this point. Putin has China’s full support. Sanctions won’t be very effective.
58,@DavidCMurphy Went to both Yalta and Odessa as well. So much history there.
59,@Mira404 @McFaul Appreciate it. Wasn't aware of @McFaul. Been reading the translations of Putin.
60,@dwr someone just recommended in a DM a few mins ago. excellent so far. good rec
61,@justinlabel appreciate it
62,The Ukranian people are exceptionally strong. They'll get through this. Praying for the country nonetheless. 🇺🇦♥️🙏
63,"Also, my great grandfather was a geologist who worked along the Black Sea. He took my family to Ukraine in 1993 when I was 7 years old. The country was absolutely ravaged by the collapse of the Soviet Union -- ""grocery stores"" were effectively empty."
64,What are the best sources for what's happening on the ground in Ukraine?
65,@isabelleboemeke Agree
66,@amytongwu @FTX_Official Congrats Amy!
67,@mjwenger1 Crypto is no different than any other large technological discontinuity in history; most won’t get it until it slaps them in the face.
68,@mjwenger1 Yes and only just the very beginning
69,@a_sarentorbic didn't see that post. i've been thinking about this for years. the best ideas are in the air!
70,@timothywilsons I am well aware
71,@alexrkonrad @wearemelonn Called it 🤣
72,@JamesByrne88 @AlexShulepov7 Good luck collecting those payments
73,"@JamesByrne88 @AlexShulepov7 Yes not very relevant in America today, but what about in Canada today if you’re a trucker? If you have a custodial wallet you can exchange at half price for goods. Right now. In Canada."
74,@JamesByrne88 @AlexShulepov7 You are thinking from the American perspective which is unfortunately a waning perspective
75,@JamesByrne88 @AlexShulepov7 What do you think the stimulus checks were? Credit?
76,"@JamesByrne88 @AlexShulepov7 By definition a reserve currency is a currency held in large reserves by central banks as part of their foreign reserves; and then that it can be used for large settlements and debt payments

Crypto is perfect for this and early signs that this will happen are already here"
77,@aashrairavooru @balajis I don’t think many
78,@JamesByrne88 @AlexShulepov7 With all due respect I think this is legacy thinking. Did the Fed control “inflation” the last two years while theyUS printed trillions of dollars and many assets tripled in price?
79,"@cullend @lpolovets There are like 100? To name a few:

Many of the exchanges: FTX, Coinbase, Blockchain, etc

Opensea

Many of the leading DeFi platforms

Many of the node providers

The Layer 1’s themselves

And I’m just getting started…"
80,@AnastasiaU @PSEUDO1984 @VitalikButerin @punk6529 I’m not saying it’s the modern age by any stretch of the imagination. I’m saying crypto OGs are some of the best students of history you’ll find.
81,@AnastasiaU @PSEUDO1984 @VitalikButerin @punk6529 I would say irrational optimism but knowledge is fair.
82,"@PSEUDO1984 @VitalikButerin @punk6529 @AnastasiaU Candidly by definition almost anyone that entered pre 2013. But some examples are @balajis, @dakami (RIP), Aaron Swartz (RIP), and literally the majority of OGs"
83,"@PSEUDO1984 @VitalikButerin @punk6529 @AnastasiaU Sir, with all due respect, this hasn’t been my experience. At least with people that entered years ago. More recently I agree"
84,"@PSEUDO1984 I totally agree. But that’s every field. 99% consumers, 1% builders"
85,@PSEUDO1984 At least amongst early crypto people I think at least 50% read the Federalist Papers intently which is at least an order of magnitude higher rate  than any other subgroup
86,@DrStarson @Caltech Changed my life as well! Meeting you as a highlight
87,RT @DrStarson: @shaunmmaguire @Caltech Memories! https://t.co/UHtwhTHjar
88,@DrStarson @Caltech THE BEST!!!!!!
89,@tehlike @rabois_likes this is exactly the correct approach.
90,"@tehlike @rabois_likes I have been to Turkey 5 times. One trip was from Batumi, Georgia along the Black Sea to Istanbul. Then from Istanbul to Antakya, then into Syria. Another trip from Istanbul down to Ephesus. Another to SE Turkey / Mt Ararat.

I'm deeply familiar with the history :)"
91,"@karanbhangui @Caltech also, just the IQs there, very inspiring. I doubt there's another place on Earth with as much IQ density."
92,"@karanbhangui @Caltech it was the best time of my life. You said it perfectly: ""the pinnacle of human rationality and attempting to conquer nature."" Or at least to understand nature, rather than conquer. What a special place."
93,@ario we r persian brothers. it's a dominant culture. i eat tahdig 3x+ times per week!!! :)
94,@MohitJain0920 That is truly how I feel. I'm doing this for my kids and grandchildren.
95,"@justinlabel FWIW, even if the US banned crypto, it wouldn't really matter. China has tried banning crypto, I think 7 times now? Barely a dent each time. It's a very broken asset class, but an asset class that's not going away!"
96,@AlexShulepov7 respectfully disagree.
