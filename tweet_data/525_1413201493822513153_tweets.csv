25,"@NFTSasha @Gee__Gazza Me 2 mate no hate &amp; I like the cats😄Just compatible with minecraft it’s not the be all end all..I’d compare WRLD to a computer console NES,XBox,etc and each plot/project built on it are the games, Minecraft just has the infrastructure available to build them atm…could change"

30,@Gee__Gazza @NFTSasha Yeah I suppose and maybe right click save a bit of a stretch but it’s along them lines and that way of thinking 😄Guess will just have to wait &amp; see where WRLD goes but it’d be the last project I’d be sleeping on atm..
31,"@Gee__Gazza @NFTSasha Can you not see the irony here in his initial take and how it looks like every normie argument about the whole nft space in general? Why are we hodling a jpg of an Ape? It’s obv not the jpg, just like it’s not just a 13eth plot of land on a minecraft server…👋"
32,"@Gee__Gazza @NFTSasha lol quite clearly it’s not a piece of land on a minecraft server so it’s a garbage take..never been more impressed with a project team and what they’ve done/delivering on the daily with some pretty innovative stuff, was also a free mint..go back to shilling your ape to Adidas 🤣"
