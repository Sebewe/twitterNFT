20,Up 100% since my Tweet. Not bad! $TKNFY https://t.co/OIZxOaIH0c
21,@Daddydelphia @iloverold @Wingvest @themetroverse
22,I've been saying it since January 21st. You do not want to miss out on the epic run that $TKNFY will experience. https://t.co/LyRQZfGUf7
23,"@DiscoverXnft I’ll be the one you wish you followed when MekaApes pulls a Wolf Game this week, and when Ape Invaders experiences the same success as Creepz."
24,"@DiscoverXnft You probably know this already, but MekaApes Game is about to be the next Wolf Game, hopefully without an exploit. With 18,500 minted, there are 199 listed. With a game that makes it increasingly difficult to mint, the supply shock is inbound in the next 48 hours."
25,"(3/5) The ""Drone Invaders"" not only have far more PFP potential than the ""Reptillian Armoury,"" but if a comparable price trajectory as Creepz (which is a collection of 10,000) is to be expected, what will occur with Ape Invaders with only 5,500 in the collection?"
26,"(2/5) The collection was launched with staking live. The team has commented that token utility will begin in the coming 48 hours. Their next collection, ""Drone Invaders,"" which is equivalent to the @CBCreepz 
""Reptillian Armoury,"" will go live soon."
27,"@flywheelfund @ApeInvaders @CBCreepz Absolutely, without a doubt. Once the Drone Invaders minting goes live, it will be Creepz on steroids. Keep in mind, the Ape Invaders collection only has 5,500."
28,"@flurnft Ape Invaders will be releasing their ""drone invaders"" collection shortly, which is comparable to the Creepz Reptilian Armoury (but doubles as a fantastic PFP). This collection won't be a ""cheap alternative"" for very long."
29,@iFungibility @TheApeInvaders Excellent thread!
30,"@OttoSuwenNFT @TheApeInvaders is the next to accomplish this. Art that doubles as a great PFP, while incorporating staking, player actions that generate additional utility tokens, and upcoming minting of a new collection. This has your name written all over it, @OttoSuwenNFT."
31,"Just staked my $TKNFY. I've been saying it for days now that people will at some point wake up and realize that @tokenfy_ is building a phenomenal platform that will be used by countless teams to kickstart their #NFT projects. It's only a matter of time. Until then, stake away..."
32,@ElectionDayMad1 Would love to be! As long as you're behind it!
33,"All I know is, people are going to be very upset that they sold their $TKNFY for pennies (currently an $8 million market cap) when it will be $1+ in the not-too-distant future. @tokenfy_ #cryptocurrency"
34,"The disbelief regarding its success will be short-lived. Its platform and offering are quite real, with a product that has a genuine use case. It's a no-brainer. Now, the question is: how long will it take for people to (1) realize its existence, and (2) believe in its potential?"
35,"$TKNFY will experience a slow, but steady grind higher over the coming few weeks. Early on, people will be reluctant to claim due to poor price action. As it performs better and better by the hour, those claiming and selling for pennies will slow the momentum, but..."
36,"Just claimed my $TKNFY. Same airdrop concept as $LOOKS based on OpenSea volume, except it is dedicated to NFT project launching. Contract was verified as safe by @0xQuit. Will be HODLing for the foreseeable future. We'll see where this goes. #NFT #NFTProject"
37,"Just joined the #Metroverse. It incorporates two major NFT themes that have been outperforming the broader market by a wide margin: land and gaming. With its staking functionality, @themetroverse is primed for a wild ride."
38,"Well, there you go, folks! It looks like @truth (#illuminatinft) is going to be the next blue-chip #NFT. Barely any dip following their reveal (floor price up over 50%), and only 750 listed of 8,128. Plus, who doesn't want to be in the #Illuminati?"
39,"@NFTmachine Hey, maybe that means you need to find your next-gen NFT influencer cohort."
40,I was blown away by the outpouring of support from the Lazy Lions community after announcing that I was joining the pride. It's clear that this is a project with staying power. Now I need to look at these bungalows... #LazyLions #LazyLionsNFT
41,"Finally updated my profile picture to a Lazy Lion. Something about the collection just strikes me as one with staying power. To quote Borat, “I like!” #LazyLions #NFTCommmunity"
