There exists a money stock which is the cumulative amount of money in a certain system

Figure out where that money is now, and where it will flow next and you win

8,"In a time of disarray, I think the near short term may not be bright for crypto, but the more fucked up the world gets, the bigger the opportunity for crypto to prove itself

If you actually think this is good tech, opportunity-rich times like this may not come around often"

11,"@vrypan wrong incentive structure, allocation of 200 masks out of 16000 with no secondary sales fee to team == no real incentive to pump the project from the side of the team

people will blame the founders, but Hashmasks launched at a different time, with no roadmap or promises"
12,"One of the most important structural factors of NFT projects is that team members have a significant allocation of project NFTs that they don't sell

People will cry about team allocations being high, but you want a teams incentives to be aligned with the community"
13,"Thinking that for identity based NFT collections that are supposed to unite people around a core set of values it's better to rally people around the values first, and then drop NFTs instead of trying to rally people around the NFTs and then drop values on them.

42,"@mart1ndoteth @Worldwide_WEB3 dont know about that

people use twitter a lot because it lets them flex their NFTs (among other things)

suddenly you can go on quests and fight monsters as your NFT in a pixel game that gives you nostalgic vibes

we shall see"
43,"@mart1ndoteth @Worldwide_WEB3 getting people outside of crypto to pay thousands for an apartment is not the goal

the vision is that apartments let holders shape the game through a builder &amp; quest engine 

creator economy"
44,"@mart1ndoteth @Worldwide_WEB3 you can build all kinds of utility onto the engine, infinite possibility.

the question to me becomes can the team figure out the right incentives for players in and outside of crypto and the right utility to drive value to apartments while also keeping the game fun for everyone"
45,"@mart1ndoteth @Worldwide_WEB3 But current narratives establish basis for future brand value which can be used for marketing, so current narratives are not always negative

back to utility, we have a scalable pixel game that can be accessed using a single link and loads within a second"
46,"@mart1ndoteth @Worldwide_WEB3 I don't disagree that it is narrative right now, as with most things that drive prices in crypto 

basically, you're speculating on the team delivering if you buy in, utility is not yet known

only established community trust &amp; proof of development and capability (for now)"
47,"@mart1ndoteth @Worldwide_WEB3 good thread

you are looking at a 100 million dollar market cap for a platform that gives utility to a growing 32 billion dollar industry

your calculations are wrong

56,"""the community is strong"" is the wrong way to look at projects

the question should be

""is this project magnetic enough to attract a community within a long term time frame"""

72,"I'm not going to claim that we intentionally had these two points in mind when we designed the tokenomics. Except for the penthouses, we knew those were gonna be sought afetr. 

It's fun to observe how token type distribution can cause so many dynamics within communities."
73,"The supply disparity between small, medium and large apartments causes Mediums to be ""undervalued""

Normally, you would think that mediums should have at least twice the price of the smalls, because they are medium-sized.

5000 smalls, 3000 mediums (instead of 2500), 1000 large"
74,"The @Worldwide_WEB3 apartment type supply distribution design is a master class in NFT marketing through tokenomic design.

The 69 Penthouses are sought-after luxury apartments, that not everyone can have. These cause high sales which draw attention.

Mediums are undervalued."
