I’m wondering if my idea here is a different kind of delegation. Likening it to government where certain departments have autonomy but are elected or appointed to do so. That much would be complimentary, but different, than workstreams."

Perhaps a group that has been designated authority and autonomy to make certain decisions on behalf of the larger group."
