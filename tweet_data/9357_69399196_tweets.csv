30,"@gnomonAnon @crypto_coven Personally, not at all. Art inspires art. If I were one of the photographers, stylists, or makeup artists, I would be honored to be emulated in this way."
31,"I took a 2+ year break from tweeting…but I suppose I’m back in action and only tweet about NFTs/web3? Apologies to the hex haters, but I’ve never had more fun on this platform. I am barely even upset that my entire financial portfolio is in shambles. 😳"
32,✨Discovered an old thread from @crypto_coven highlighting their sources of inspiration.✨I doubt there is another collection that has garnered *such* genuine &amp; intense love from the community. I’ve traded idle insta browsing for dreamily browsing witches. Scope the full thread. https://t.co/OEwJ7QP463

90,@parulia @crypto_coven I actually didn't do direct trades. Sold on Opensea and then bought this lady afterward. (Ending up being more financially beneficial to sell mine first because they sold for a little more than I bought Francium for.) But I do wonder what options are out there for trades!
91,@WitchyBits1 @crypto_coven Thank you! Maybe I should find an ethereal witch next to balance out my collection's intensity. :)
