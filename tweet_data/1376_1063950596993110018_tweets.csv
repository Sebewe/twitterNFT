it means more is coming from that collaboration and for Clones"
49,@JKB_90 @RTFKTstudios Not sure to be honest.

55,@KayfabeNFT @RTFKTstudios Like the sound of this
56,@KayfabeNFT @RTFKTstudios I feel like my minds getting lazy already. Sudoku is too easy to me now
57,@RTFKTstudios I’m here doing sudoku puzzles back to back. Didn’t understand why at first.
58,Yo @RTFKTstudios I kinda miss questing lol. Is that weird?

68,Just a heads up the linked account in this post is the scam version. Please always confirm the creator of the collection on Opensea.
69,"CLONEX fam it looks as though someone has created a fake collection of Casa Del Botin on opensea. 

Please be careful as this is a scam account. ⚠️

Please only use the link in my bio to access my collection ✅

73,"@mgxs_gnss @mgxs_co 2 just hits different. I get emotions of excitement with a hint of formality. It portrays a more complex level of mystery yet maintaining a decent level of simplicity. 

I choose 2."

80,@iodisworld When NFT collection ?
81,I swear after these RTFKT quests. Nothing will ever be hidden from me in plain sight again. I’m starting to see air particles. https://t.co/tH5LE4drfZ
82,@parsivaleth This will be the hardest decision ill@have to make this year tbh
83,@Alts_Anonymous @wiss_wisss @RTFKTstudios It’s all about pretending like you know. That’s the key.
84,@wiss_wisss @Alts_Anonymous @RTFKTstudios https://t.co/fVURLSO4qK
85,@ycxchoy @RTFKTstudios Should be re-listed fairly soon 🤙
86,"@enthydra @RTFKTstudios Hi thanks for reaching out. Hi removed the item of sale as opensea has reported that Polygon is experiencing stability issues that may impact Polygon transactions. So for the meantime, I thought it would be safer to remove off sale until this issue is sorted. Safety first!"
87,@benitopagotto Absolutely epic

89,"A huge thank you to everyone that managed to buy the Casa Del Botin lootpod skin on OpenSea. This was my very first ever NFT drop.

It’s a constant progress and will be updating it as often as necessary to ensure that you get the best results for what you paid. 

Thank you fam! https://t.co/qskLzWS4Rr"
90,"@bigshottoyworks @RTFKTstudios In terms of the size, the skin is an overlay as opposed to a replacement so there will be a slight margin overlap to ensure there is no skin to skin distortion. It may be worth adjusting your pre-hung assets slightly to accommodate."
91,@bigshottoyworks @RTFKTstudios Just checked and it’s not showing as it being installed. May be worth removing it from the edit mode and reinstalling it. It could be an issue with oncyber. Let me know if you’ve tried it
92,"@bigshottoyworks @RTFKTstudios The music does not come with the pods. It’s just the skin that you get.
What type of error are you getting?"
93,Sitting here wondering when someone will start up the first web3 NFT insurance company. Definitely needed during these times.
94,@RisingSunCryp I appreciate you 🤙
95,@borg_brain @elonmusk Haha
96,@Arikk3D I agree with you 100 percent. I definitely think it’s easy to devalue your work in the beginning by trying to be more competitive. I’d say value it at what you believe your work is worth and let the sales come as they may. Longevity is key
97,@ReyCrypto810 @bigshottoyworks @RTFKTstudios It would be great if they oncyber introduced an inbuilt lighting system
98,@bigshottoyworks @RTFKTstudios Not that I know of. All lighting is baked into the skin unfortunately
99,Will be airdropping the second part of the loot pod to all Casa Del Botin holders when ready. Back to work.
