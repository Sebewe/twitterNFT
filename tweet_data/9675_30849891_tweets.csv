2,"So woke up to all this @NFTCryptoChicks drama.

A case of plagiarism with malious intent, or just an aspiring artist following YouTube tutorials?

3,"@BigJetTVLies Jerry became a national folklore legend today. A part of British pop culture. The ""Jackie Weaver"" of 2022. Big Jet TV just became a household name.

9,"@PetrovichKolya @ethereansinfo @sassal0x I think it's quite funny to get ratio'd.

He accused me of authoritarianism/subjugation when I defended his freedom to speak. That doesn't even make sense.

I thought better of entering into a dictionary quoting debate though. We all have Google right?"
10,RT @Nogoodtwts: @bitcoin4bernie @nicksdjohnson https://t.co/mB09njXmpp
11,"@ethereansinfo @sassal0x As far as I can see, everybody in this debate was able to exercise their freedom using the definition you just provided.

But thanks for the additional clarity on the dictionary definition of freedom, I feel it was really pertinent here."
12,"@jdcc_inc @ethereansinfo @sassal0x Exactly.

Nothing has been censored.

The comments are filled with the views of both sides. In fact today seems to be a victory for free speech advocates."
13,"@ethereansinfo @sassal0x Today was a victory for freedom.

The freedom for me to challenge his opinion. The freedom for you to critisise their decision to terminate his contract.

The freedom for True Names Ltd to make a decision in the best interests of their business, taking into account both views."
14,"@sassal0x It was a pretty good day today for ""democratised finace"" in my opinion."
15,"@_axtina @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Most of the stuff he was saying could not be described as a religious stance. In many countries it would be classified as hate speech and a crime.

This isn't about religion, he just tried to play that card to save his skin.

I know Catholics and they don't say those things."
16,"Web3 is for everybody. Glad to see the ENS team stepping up here.

A number of prominent crypto influencers tried to frame people calling out hate speech as ""wokies"".

Web3 is censorship resistant. Valid critism of hate can't be silenced by branding it ""woke culture"". https://t.co/KuJan1NS3X"

18,"@nicksdjohnson @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains Isn't this just textbook whataboutism? 

He was called out for publicly persecuting groups of people, but now claims to be the one being persecuted.

No one even mentioned his religion as being an issue here, only his words."
19,"Of course, the good news is that the Ethereum blockchain, where most NFTs are stored, is going to proof of stake in the coming months.

That's right, the online jpeg people are actually doing something about it!

Forget the virtue signalling, this is real action."
20,"So there you have it.

People will always be obsessed by the environmental impact of the ""one thing"" they don't do. Because it's so much easier than making any actual change themselves.

Blame the online jpeg people for everything. I'm sure it must be their fault."
21,"Isn't it so much easier to show your support for the environment by firing off a few tweets about the problems caused by ""other people"" while doing absolutely nothing yourself.

Everyone now knows what a true environmental champion you are, and all it took was a tweet."
22,"What about NFTs?

All right. I think we are on to something here. Everybody who has never owned an NFT can now signal their support for environmental causes, without making any personal sacrifice whatsoever, and making no change in their own life."
23,"Watching Netflix or YouTube, and using the internet in general is an environmental drain too.

You could argue that it's unnecessary, but the pursuit of online entertainment and video streaming is something most people enjoy."
24,"Perhaps we could consume less meat, or even go vegan entirely?

This helps the environment as well as ends cruelty to animals.

But most people are not willing to make the sacrifice, the enjoyment of eating meat is apparently more important to most people."
25,"Perhaps stopping international travel, less plane journeys would help right? While some travel for business, many more travel for pleasure.

But that would require giving up the joy of travel, a personal sacrifice not many are willing to make."
26,"Nobody wants to give up their car. They know it's bad for the environment, but perhaps they need if for their livelihood.

Electric cars are coming, but they are often costly, and the infrastructure isn't there yet.

So what else can I do to help?"
27,"A thread about why people are obsessed with the environmental impact of NFTs.🧵

In 2022, most people accept that climate change is a problem, and that things may need to change. But changing your lifestyle is difficult, costly, and can require personal sacrifices.

28,"@BrantlyMillegan I read the first word of your bio when I first followed you actually. I am accepting of everybody and have no issue with you being a Catholic.

But your views are hateful, not aligned with any of the Catholics I know, nor do they tally with my personal Christian upbringing."

I mean, I've just been conditioned from years of software/internet use to expect American English everywhere."
61,"@NFT_Maverick @Iam0xB0B @Crypto__Chicks So your saying it could go up or down?

Bold take."
62,"BTW, I have explored all sorts of recovery options over the years. In fact there is still an experienced wallet cracker who works on my old wallet from time to time.

I don't think I'll ever get back in to it personally. And I've accepted the loss."
63,"Even with my big loss, I kind of made some back in the end. I'll probably never have 550 Ethereum again. But maybe, just maybe, someone wants to buy my avatar for 550 Ethereum and make me whole again?

Ah, I can dream right."
64,"I know this is a long tweet thread. But I just wanted to tell my story. People always talk about hacking, but very rarely about ""loss"".

You can lose all your crypto if you don't have backup access. And there is no way to get it back. Ever.

Look after your wallet."
65,"Fast forward to late 2018. I had missed the depression of the bear market, and still felt good about Ethereum. Once it crashed below $100 in December 2018, I was a buyer again.

And that's how I made my way back."
66,"ETH reached well over $400 before I even knew I had lost access to the wallet. I thought I was rich, but I had nothing.

I was totally crushed. I once again checked out of crypto, and missed Ethereum's bull run to $1400 in late 2017/early 2018."
67,"Big mistake. I was travelling in New Zealand at the time. I sent it to a new wallet, but didn't save the password for the wallet correctly. I was on someone else's computer, and had no proper backs up, seed phrases or anything.

I was totally fucked. And it was my own fuck up."
68,"Fast forward to mid 2017, and I hear that ETH is starting to gain some traction. It's up to $50! Holy fuck.

I read about the ETH/ETC hard fork. I decided to dump my ETC, and then lost all the money gambling on dice sites.

I kept the 550 ETH, and sent it to a new wallet."
69,"At this point, the DAO hack happened (look it up). Ethereum crashed from like $20 to less than $10 if I recall. Everyone was freaking out.

I decided to lock my ETH up in a cold wallet for years ""just in case"" it went to the moon one day. And I checked out from crypto."
70,"I started reading about Ethereum, and it seemed incredible. And it had only just launched.

I traded my remaining Dogecoin, Shitcoins and everything else and went all in on Ethereum.

I then margin traded my way all the way up to 550 total Ethereum on Poloniex."
71,"Seriously, I spent some big money on a load of stuff that went to zero. But then in 2016 my fate changed. I was on Poloniex, and the trollbox was going wild about something called ""Ethereum"".

It had smart contracts, and that was supposed to be big deal apparently."
72,"My first crypto was Dogecoin in December 2013. I started mining it really early on, and bought a bit too. I ended up with 12 million Dogecoin, which I think is quite a lot these days.

I then spent years trading Shitcoins, and pretty much lost it all."
73,"I first bought ETH in January 2016. I paid about $100 USD for 42 ETH.

Yeah you read that right. I was buying ETH around 2 fucking dollars. I must be rich/retired by now right? Wrong!

I was so early in Crypto, but it kind of all went wrong for me."
74,"My Crypto Chick has been for sale on OpenSea price at 550 ETH for around the last 4 months. Want to know why I picked the number 550?
