1,@xDoubleQ @birthmark_tv Lol i can’t believe this actually happens
2,@nullchinchilla @punk6529 Let’s not pretend people are actually “using” Doge lol
3,@GiancarloChaux @MichaelTant3 @punk6529 Right but Shib surpassed Doge when it was much less easy to access
4,@punk6529 This is one of the top reasons I remain bullish. And that’s just Doge. Once the shitcoiners get a taste of NFTs they will realize how much more fun it is to trade them
5,@InvertedTheOri1 !ooh
6,"@PunkieEth Yup, a lot of projects are ponzis with some shiny lights to keep people distracted and holding"
7,"@vibezgm @nftworldsNFT @Zeneca_33 @andymilonakis Haha nice I think I bought a couple at around the same price, then we hit a bear market and I was thrilled to sell at like 0.7. Good lesson to hang on to least one lol"
8,@vibezgm @nftworldsNFT What did you buy in at? Props for holding I sold long ago lol

15,"@robnessofficial I don't see a problem, degen gambling is one of the cornerstones of NFTs, and I hope it stays that way"
16,"Imagine revealing this, cutting your losses because you think there's no way it will be worth anything, and then watching it become a meme and moon.

This exact scenario must have happened to someone and if it did I'm truly sorry lol https://t.co/H66XDK9qXb"

24,@cleanunicorn You could say he has a “primitive”understanding of ETH 😏
25,"Ironically a prolonged NFT bear market could make the projects that popped in 2021 - 2022 more valuable in the long run, because they would stand out more."
26,@NathanHeadPhoto Due respect but we have no idea what a good long term investment in this space looks like

47,@VGFreakXBL It's okay not to have an opinion on anything
48,"@mrhammink nice thread mfer! I would add that if the project you think had a ton of potential doesn't get traction after a while, don't be afraid to rotate to something else."
49,@nath1of1 GL my fren
50,@Roisin25568574 @osf_nft Yeah we have no idea what NFTs (or a similar technology) could be like in 20-30 years
51,"@toady_hawk Lol, I needed this laugh today"
52,"@bubits_ Oops I think I replied to the wrong post before. Anyway, I agree with you there for sure. There are way too many people just looking to cash in."
53,"@bubits_ And if they don’t promote themselves, another artist will. Then that person will get the attention even if their art is of lower quality. I wish it could be for the art only, but realistically artists have to promote to succeed. But they should do it in a respectful way."
54,"@bubits_ I think it’s a bit more complicated than that. Artists have always been able to do it for the art only, the problem is many artists were not able to make enough money scrape by. One of the best parts about NFTs is it allows artist to make ends meet while making great art."
55,"@bubits_ That definitely matters too. Generally I don’t have a problem with posts promoting their work, but aggressive DMs are not the way. However, I can’t say I get many of those. Is there anything in particular that bothers you?"
56,@bubits_ It depends on whether the art is good lol
57,"Ultimately, you are responsible for creating the narrative that will help you succeed.

If you got in on a project, sold early, and then it 10x’d, take the positive lesson from it. Your instincts were good, you just need to trust them more going forward."

69,@BlueBadger2600 @cdkns93 @Kratochvil8228 that's what they're saying lol. it's even more sad if they have a hidden agenda and that's the excuse they came up with 😂
70,"@cdkns93 @Kratochvil8228 @BlueBadger2600 That’s what they’re figuring out now. It was 50 total or 5 diff collections. 

But they realized people were listing low quality NFTs (what did they think, people were going to post their BAYC on a new website with an undoxed team?) so they paused it"
71,@tier_nf @DeezeFi @not_katarina @CritterzNFT This. The team is consistently delivering on a crazy ambitious roadmap.
72,"@not_katarina Same here. Except I did it on two of them, after telling myself it was a long term hold 😑.

Easy solution, though, buy a Genesis Critterz instead. It's a better Minecraft play imo. One connected world instead of 10,000 separate ones."

81,"@ArturFalco3 Dope, excited to see the progress!"
82,@0xAnto @InvsbleFriends @TastyBonesNFT I agree we’ve seen hyped projects in 2022 but this might be the most hyped in a while
83,Food for thought: The NFT market seems better able to support multiple big drops lately. But how much liquidity will a super hyped project like @InvsbleFriends suck out of the market? Can other big drops like @TastyBonesNFT still succeed in the short term? I’ll be watching.

93,"Thanks to everyone who voted!

For me, it sometimes seems limiting to say NFT projects are “just” brands, but I think it’s basically true.

Decentralized brands that reward engagement and community like never before. That’s something we can be proud to be a part of. https://t.co/YhPdbKw2F0"
