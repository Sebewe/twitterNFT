65,"@EthanLington We’ll find it a good home soon, it’s alright!"
66,"@LaznNugget There’s a price for everything, but I love the speshies, so hard to let him go."
67,"But I think it’s important to realize that the there is plenty of opportunity to contribute to the community. Be patient, give everything you have, and ask for nothing in return. It might not get you the viral sensation, but you’ll see the fruits of your labor slowly over time."
68,"The next-level YT folks will get the big splashy deals and mega view counts. And the smaller guys have slow and steady growth. 

I think you see the same here as well. There are the blue chip creators (@cathsimard_ @DrifterShoots ) with a dedicated and loyal base+rising floor"
69,"Success on platforms such as YouTube has always been segmented this way. You either have the people who create Uber-compelling content (Mr Beast) or the people who are willing to give away all their knowledge for free (Peter McKinnon, Matti, Justin Odisho… etc)"
70,"My thoughts on succeeding in the photo NFT space are the same as succeeding in the previous creator economy 🧵 

At a high level: You either need to be otherworldly good at what you do, or you need to be more helpful, supportive, and selfless than anyone else is willing to be."
