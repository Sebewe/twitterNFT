3,"@someMBTArailfan If you're open minded enough to even read the posts I just made, cool. I'll take some time and you can talk trains with me if you want. It's not really my thing but I try to stay open to the things people are excited about."
4,"@someMBTArailfan I'm just saying, I've spent some of my time today to voice my side of this topic, as you've also spent some of your time today on how you detest NFTs. I get it, that's fine. But let's get to the point where we can have a real conversation about it."
5,"@someMBTArailfan But then there's also some cool ones and even some fun ones. They are built by a team developing a brand over time, cool people love to identify with brands. That's nothing new right? 
Then there's even games that are fun with cool communities."
6,"@someMBTArailfan Now let's get to the nitty gritty, there's tons of shitty NFTs out there. That's just the way it works when people can make money, most industries are no different. There's a really shitty Wendy's nearby I won't go to because it's shit lol."
7,"@someMBTArailfan Saving it to your phone is fine, you've just made a replica of an NFT. At the end of the day the NFT doesn't care, and even more so enjoys it because it's free advertising."
8,"@someMBTArailfan Lmfao fren. Honestly I'd like to take the time to explain how Blockchain can certify something is authentic, like sports cards or comic books, or maybe even very specific model trains that collectors want to verify it's legit."
