22,"@chibiapegang @farokh @CryptoMories @opensea Is it inconceivable that two humans could independently think of a simple design on their own? It’s much more likely that it’s an honest unawareness over art theft. It’s not “clearly a copy”, and trying to say it is destroys the credibility of anything else you say."

37,"@gweilonft @thereisonlymoi @MetaMask Totally agree w free from being unverifiable without a ton of work. there are two separate issues for me: legibility/visibility, and then verification/safety. 1 is easier 2 is very very hard

Good thing many smart people are working on it. We need moar designers tho 😇🌟🌈"
38,@clawcheezles @MetaMask @coinbase @phantom @YoroiWallet @solflare_wallet @TempleWallet Thanks for sharing 🌟🤝
39,"@tayvano_ Zero ideas about updating contacts after the fact — but i wonder if there could be semantic detection based on previously verified smart contracts.

“Degen minting” (inherently risky) vs
“I got phished on a fake opensea site” (you didn’t read the permissions) 

Diff things right?"
40,"@tayvano_ Not today, but maybe next 
For now it’s volunteer-based and fun-based :)"
41,"@tayvano_ @MetaMask I wonder if there could be a way to render dev comments from the contract in a certain format ? Assuming there’s an agreed upon interface for that. Kind of how etherscan shows comments in the “write” tabs on a contract.

Although that doesn’t guarantee safety either 😅"
42,@tayvano_ @MetaMask Also thank you for the thoughtful reply ✨❤️🙏
43,@tayvano_ @MetaMask Good call out. “Knowing” if something is safe might not be possible today… but I hope at least making it clear what a user is agreeing to is a step in the right direction
