1,"@Crypto_Henry99 @wolfdotgame Yea and people are also slowly getting bored of waiting. For value to rise, the demand has to increase. For demand to increase, user base needs to grow. hence event 2 is about marketing. For wolfgame assets to go 2x… the wolfgame followers have to grow atleast 75k"
2,"RT @pixeleyes_eth: @wolfdotgame Wolf Game Trailer for the Wool Event #2 entry!

@Wongsworth Kingdom #1701 

For the love of the WG and NFT…"
3,@pixeleyes_eth @metapunk__ @wolfdotgame @Wongsworth This is #AWESOME!
4,@NFLALLDAYUpdate @NFLALLDAY Are you adding more NFTs to the pool? How can number of nfts remaining &lt;4800 go up to &gt;5110?
5,@hexagonxyz @metavatar_app nisargypandya.eth
6,"@davidbankless @wolfdotgame I went back &amp; re-read some of the old tweets from the shepherd. “Build, Breed, Cultivate &amp; Govern” So far we know a little bit about building(fortifications, barns, casinos) &amp; breeding. What do you think farmers will cultivate? Seems an easy guess - FarmVille? What do we govern? https://t.co/0MXL3m8y63"
7,"@adamsmoot On the contrary, I do feel that @NFLALLDAY needs to work on their logic of selling previous week's moments in current drops. That's just lazy. Worst... they were selling giants nft for 999$! Seriously!"
8,"@davidbankless @wolfdotgame Possibly… doesn’t that make the game kinda one sided? What’s the fun if wolves always win? I’d assume they’d give a decent arc to the story. Maybe the wolves get into some dangerous situation, some get killed but the alphas steal victory in the end 🤷🏽‍♂️"
9,"@davidbankless @wolfdotgame Here’s my thought: No more staking rewards for the wolves… lands will grow grass feed for sheep, farmers can help increase the yields, shear the sheep, even build fences to protect sheep from wolves… wolves will have to risk their lives and raid farms for sheep."
10,"@davidbankless @wolfdotgame I think phase 1 was intentionally geared to the advantage of the wolves… phase 2 could be a total opposite… what’s the fun in the game if the wolves always have an advantage? If you look at the arc, I believe this phase might bring some protection to the sheep."
11,@cdt_eth @nouns_stories Perfect! The idea of nouns films definitely seem COOL!
12,@cdt_eth @nouns_stories Looks pretty empty
13,@8BitPrime @NFLALLDAYUpdate @NFLALLDAY Any proof? Maybe screenshot from someone who’s able to buy a pack after 1:39 pm?
14,"@Steve_Lemonakis @WAD1980 @NFLALLDAYUpdate @NFLALLDAY That’s a tricky situation to be in… technically if a user lost their spot, do they get re-imbursed or some goodies or they are re-given their spot in line? All of these steps will have different code paths and consequences… each resulting in a delay of its own."
15,@NFLALLDAYUpdate @NFLALLDAY If the line is paused then why are number of packs available getting reduced?

17,@0xBender Free dick! 😆
18,@0xBender Just in case if you didn’t know… mufat can mean two things in an Indian language: 1st meaning is - free (usually for free stuff). 2nd meaning is blunt(like a person is too blunt). Kinda funny that the person used “mufat” token😆

26,@kathyhannun Are there any plans in near future to expand Dandelion services on west coast? The current Geothermal providers are a total ripoff in California!

34,@wolfdotgame What's the difference in land parcel minted now at higher price vs the one minted at 0.1 eth? Can you list some details on that?
35,@wolfdotgame Is https://t.co/6FrosP2Fn8 legit?
36,"@wolfdotgame Is minting wool still available? Also, can we directly try to mint it from it's contract on etherscan rather than buying it from uniswap?"
37,"Check out my new NFT on OpenSea! https://t.co/MUb5GeNTVM via @opensea

38,"@SnowdogDAO @SnowbankDAO Team, do you think you can also drop a snowdog nft for $sdog hodlers at the end of Day8? A meme coin is a great idea but a corresponding nft would be fantastic. Your thoughts?"
39,"@itsorawan Honestly, it's totally upto you. Since you're the creator, i'd love to let you decide whichever way is easier for you. Gas fees will keep on fluctuating depending on the time of day."

53,"@0xBender In the pursuit of more value(eth) in return, folks tend loose a sight of how costly the principal investment and fees are. I kind of feel the current NFT frenzy is feeling very similar to the ico boom in 2017. Ofcourse 90+% of the icos were pure shit."
54,@versebattery LOL
55,@versebattery what happened if i may ask?
56,@0xBender When beta?
57,@foxyfamNFT can you share contract address?
58,@0x_fxnction came for the alpha... turned off by the gas fees.
59,@0xBender towards the end gas fees were around 1400 gwei!
60,@BackpackerFI That's a great idea. Just curious: How robust is this idea when fed raises the interest rates and access to free money is restricted?
