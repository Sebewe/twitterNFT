6,RT @watase_eth: What’s one thing you think stops people from entering Web3/NFTs/Crypto?
7,"@derkizzle @merc_dao @lelebtw @AmazonasNFT @Helloimmorgan @cr0ssETH @tubbycatsnft @ShadowQuest_NFT IMO That's the problem allow lists are supposed to solve. 
Most projects run on hype so you don't get that luxury by design. Secondary is all about timing too. 

Best thing we can do as developers is make it as efficient as possible so value goes to team/holder not miners."

12,"One of the biggest problems with #ERC721A is the cost of transfers. It heavily affects secondary market sales through increased gas. If you want a sustainable project you need to optimise gas on more than mints. 
Get hype for ERC721Ao saving ~15% on mint and &gt;30% on transfers https://t.co/5hAGvbGyrM"
