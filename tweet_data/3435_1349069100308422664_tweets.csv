42,"@AndrewSteinwold Not just about the token. For instance, one simple thing people have been asking (BEGGING) for is better customer support. Not to mention the website lagging like its running out of a college dorm. Rules in web3: PUT YOUR CUSTOMERS FIRST, UPGRADE AND INNOVATIVE OR STAY BEHIND."
43,@Mantaroth @LooksRareNFT All of the above + being able to edit the price without having to cancel the listing (which requires gas)
44,@essen_nft @LooksRareNFT Will do!
45,Is there a way to edit the price on a listing without having to cancel it (which requires fees)? @LooksRareNFT

79,@Cooopahtroopa We're working on some new music and were thinking about dropping it as NFTs to get support directly from our listeners in exchange of a share of the royalties. Not a huge fanbase but 2k solid fans. Was wondering what would be the best route? Any suggestions will be appreciated!
80,@genie_xyz is game changing! Now is possible to sweep the floor on collections which it wouldn't make sense to buy one by one because of high gas fees. @Scott_eth thank you for this 🙏
