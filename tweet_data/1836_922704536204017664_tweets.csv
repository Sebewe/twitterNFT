1,@beb_eth @mrmod_eth Beautiful work!!
2,@kurogod5 Tried to connect with a bunch of clones but not nearly the 5k out there. Recently switched to my pfp from @psychedelic_nft and got like 500 followers overnight. Can clones beat that? 😜 https://t.co/ysuyzqyyNW
3,"@snowy_bites Hey thanks! Appreciate it! I wish this is something that were pushed to new investors. Coinbase NFT should do something like this when they launch their platform, almost like signing  a terms of service"

6,"@emilyrosemcg Started watching My Hero Academia dubbed. Tried to switch to the subbed for new season and couldn't get into it. I liked hearing the unique voices in English version. Maybe it's cause I don't speak japanese either but I couldn't ""feel"" the characters inflections and mood easily."

- Cut your losses if you lose conviction in the project. Better to leave with some money rather than watch the price keep crashing.
- No one is an expert. This is a new space and we are all learning. Be easy on yourself.

If you found this helpful, feel free to RT 😌"

- Have an exit plan. Decide when to take profits (at x price I will sell x pieces). Sell into the hype, this is when the most liquidity is available as volume is pumping, it will be easier to sell then. Don't get stuck holding a bag when no one is buying."
9,"4/6
- You've worked hard for your money, don't throw it away hoping to get rich. Your real world obligations are important, make sure those are stable first.
- Be careful of FOMO. I've fallen victim to it, we all have. If it makes you feel emotional, it's probably implusive."

Advice to newbies:
- Don't mint everything under the sun. Most projects will ultimately disappear once the hype is gone if founders aren't in it for the long term.
- Buy into companies and brands, not a pfp. Look at the team, see what they have done and where they are going."
11,"2/6
Holders are in the chat saying once the flippers are gone they will moon. Secondary price is just above mint and being artifically kept up by founder. Sad to see anyone lose money really, especially since this project isn't failing due to malice, just inexperience."
12,"Sad to see potentially good projects fail because the founders don't understand how to run a business or market their product. Original supply was 10k, mint wasn't looking good so they cut supply to 2k. Still only minted about 435. Discord has been closed, only for holders. 1/6👇 https://t.co/KK81iD2axD"
