The class and consistency this team has kept since the very start has shown me what a giant product this could become, and I'm looking forward to the future and am really excited to be able to be participating. I will 100% be riding the MIP train. (6/6)"
27,"The incentives for holding are fairly balanced and they don't benefit whales as much as the average person. You could have 30 heads but can only benefit from 3, giving this more room for adoption and not much barrier to entry. More on this in the medium article below. (5/6) https://t.co/uEQDDqutN1"
28,"The distant future for MIP is set to be a play to earn game, they also idealized an animated series. I have no doubt that the team could actually pull this off and as I do more research I will figure out exactly who is a part of this team and what they did before. (4/6) https://t.co/aaJ8CAJAnj"
29,"These were a FREE MINT, the way this project made money was through the season pass/body/pet ticket sales. The season pass gets you more MIP coin and benefits, guaranteeing added value to your investment and rewarding you daily. (3/6) https://t.co/q8kFyBRwYe"
30,"Customizability (BIG): The MIP reveal was successful in my eyes because it accomplishes the vision of this being a project in which you have to EARN your rarity, the platform which is dropping soon will allow you to roll new parts and stick them onto a modular ERC1155 token (2/6) https://t.co/l47SGlOF5I"
31,I sweeped a couple of @MIP_project NFT's a while ago and today was reveal day. I am still doing a lot of research on it but I wanted to make a short thread outlining what I already know and why I'm bullish on the project. If you're already holding you might wanna dig in.
