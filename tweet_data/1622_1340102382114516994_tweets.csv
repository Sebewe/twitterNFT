6,@CloutedMind One can only hope they get lucky enough to mint that masterpiece
7,@AdamHustle Unreal what the team was able to put together!
8,@0xwinky Ty ser. Yours is filling out quite nicely too
9,Looped a couple of my space doods together to test the audio being seamless. Can confirm. https://t.co/02EH4wu0Hf

13,@poopie Killed it! Imagination running on the possibilities for what’s next
14,"@varounsvlogs @doodles Thanks for killing it, varoun!"
15,@juicyju33 go juicy!
16,@BiggsCrypto @thomasjeans this is a vibe for sure
17,@tropoFarmer It's also basically a free IF quality animation that includes unique audio tied directly to traits.
18,@tropoFarmer @MLfromdeep This is exactly it. Proves what the team can do and opens the door for future experiences both IRL and metaverse. Sure some will dump if they don't roll the ship they want but anyone who understands the potential implications of this tech should be hodling tight
19,@Nittyb_xyz Digging it. Honestly all of them are dope
20,@MrJamesonNeat Lol no I meant the whole 10k collection. Supposed to be able to listen in a seamless loop
21,@MrJamesonNeat wen fully looped sound?

31,@Nittyb_xyz @austin_hurwitz Which project is that a part of?
32,@davieselke27 @doodles Welcome ser! Just in time for space!
33,@Lobes604 @devinthedude07 @CloutedMind @0xwinky I forgive you 🤣💖
34,@elamnft I don’t see that happening. We haven’t had a massive run up in anticipation. This is a fun and exciting step for the future and proves that doodles are continuing to innovate and delight. Anyone who is paying attention should be holding onto their doodles for dear life.
35,@Lobes604 @devinthedude07 @CloutedMind @0xwinky I get no love 😩
36,@dagg3rhigh So glad you took the leap 🤝

45,@dagg3rhigh has consistently delivered an engaging experience above and beyond what he has promised. Narrative is so important for many of these nft projects and @TribesNFT is chock full of it. Check it out! https://t.co/3kGiPXpHpR
46,"Had to be an incredibly difficult decision. Unfortunate to see a project they felt so strongly about turn into something that caused strife. 
We need more creators like this. Responsible enough to know when things are getting out of hand. https://t.co/LWCNqy6MAj"

75,@GoTrillaGorilla @CoolmanUniverse so fly! grabbed 2 of each
76,@jed_131 @3landersNFT Almost snagged one under 4 yesterday 😩
77,@cozywyatt @3landersNFT @3landboy had a previous nft following and community that he leveraged into a larger project. He clearly has a knack for what looks good and a lot of the traits will make fantastic merch.
78,@cozywyatt @3landersNFT I bought in before price went up. The art was first but the artists personality and vision are what sold me. He has been building this universe in his head and through his art his entire life. Maybe comparable to clon and blue cat. The art is extremely approachable and brandable.
