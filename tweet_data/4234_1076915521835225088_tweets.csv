4,@LizSly Honest question.. how does a war last 20 years if the aggressors can’t trade externally? Where would the funds come from?

11,@michaelL771 this stand with the current situation. its not comparable with the every day running of a country and shouldnt be compared to it.
12,"@michaelL771 corruption exists everywhere. even if historically been bad in Ukraine, that doesnt mean a huge majority of the money isnt going directly to the war effort. And in rebuilding with blockchain it could be further accounted for going to the right places overall. its daft to take.."
13,@shvandrew oh for sure. if it was to be implemented it'd have to be done very carefully with the cooperation of those who have experience with DAOs. it wouldnt be easy but could prove to be a big success if done right
14,"In the likely event that Russia doesnt capture Ukraine, it'd be great if the rebuilding and ongoing management of some of the infrastructure was done via DAO mechanisms.. allowing global participants to directly cooperate. I strongly believe this is where crypto shows its benefit"

16,Last week I tweeted that Ukraine finance minister would be at an advantage to accept crypto and be present on Twitter since their site only had bank accounts and a FB page. I got told off for the suggestion so deleted it. I like to think ppl like me helped spur them on to do it https://t.co/6fJkuVlrNR

23,"If a token is down 80% in a year, you have to have yielded 400% back from it to cover any value loss. But if you had sold that yield consistently for ETH, which has risen 100% in the last year, then you would have needed to yield much less considering APRs are also high initially https://t.co/FNH2GYd75p"
24,"@spreekaway ah I see

25,@spreekaway Why would they be targeting RUNE specifically you think? Just what they wanna stack or is there something more to it for this kind of attack?

27,@pleasehellp2 I must have been just looking at my Etherscan. I see now that there are loads of these different tokens deposited into my addy
28,@ValidatorEth yeah tbf it does look like that. I didnt even know you could send to another addy out from Uniswap
29,@ValidatorEth oh wow.. can't say I've ever noticed this kind of activity on my own
30,@polarply @n4n084191635 @scupytrooples yeah I'm not gonna mess with my toast.eth addy
31,@n4n084191635 @scupytrooples yeah I'm not touching it
32,@aradtski ah k. I was wondering how that would work as Uniswap should only display the token thats being approved
33,a chunk of 'Ukraine DAO' tokens were deposited into my public addy along with many other .eths. It looks like its possible to swap for a fat stack of ETH but *this is a scam*. I suspect the approve actually approves other tokens at my addy but I'm not going to check. Be careful. https://t.co/JklrEsBUZ6

43,Do people still use Keybase? I forgot about that app. I remember getting free XLM and immediately dumping through it tho
44,fyi I havent done any washtrading for LOOKs. not that I can prove that ofc. you'll just have to trust me as being honest... (also a lot of my NFT trading is done on my public wallets)
45,agree tbh. I never really understand the calling out of people that do this. There is far worse behaviour than people just trying to make money from honest exploits like washtrading on LooksRare etc https://t.co/127vitPFwj

48,"@nicksdjohnson @peter_szilagyi Yep, understand. But if this kind of system is unavailable to Peter then he could opt to use 2inch timber bearers on heavy duty plastic packers instead. As long as it’s vented top and bottom then it should last decades. Not sure about his available space for either method though"
49,"@peter_szilagyi @nicksdjohnson Nick, I think the alu system is more about convenience (and hidden fixings?) that any strength gain it has over 50x50mm timber supported every 400mm? Convenience with the adjustable feet but I guess you could argue strength over time considering treated wood will eventually rot"
50,@peter_szilagyi @nicksdjohnson ok. if its a flat roof and you're still relying on the strength of that roof for the intermediate support as well as the perimeter rather than just hanging it off a perimeter bearer then I'm not sure if that space will allow an alu system over timber anyway (45mm + 20mm)
51,@nicksdjohnson @peter_szilagyi if its sat on existing base then theres no need for additional strength over what timber can give. What's the crucial aspect?
52,@keepfischin @josephdelong sure.. ofc. But when you include an economy the majority of voices will be about making that economy good for their own pockets. Like the game of life itself.
53,@TheStalwart @bigunderscorec Just send it through multiple wallets. Exchanges don't look that deep. You can't tarnish every BTC. Like cocaine on banknotes.. every note has a trace.
54,@peter_szilagyi @nicksdjohnson Maybe keep it simple and use a composite decking and use treated timber bearers to keep up off existing base

57,"@0xKimblee Yeah, you're absolutley right. It depends on a per project basis as to who the important roles are. In our case, we wanted to her be successful and the profits werent important for us as individuals since we're already doing other stuff within crypto."
58,"@PhABCD @josephdelong Same for crypto itself, yet everyone tries"
59,"@keepfischin @josephdelong but if theres no economy surrounding it, people will ask what the point of the NFT is. I think ownership very closely links to value. For a majority of participants anyway. If for example you can bring a weapon into another game.. that weapon gains value. Its unavoidable."
60,@nikitabier fish with bones. pointless.
61,@DeFi_Ted Why I can’t retweet this alpha?
62,@josephdelong The balance is making a fun game and integrating an NFT economy where everyone constantly thinks they have a chance of making profit

68,I’ve just realised a theory. You never see those remindme tweets being requoted as proof of a person’s prediction being right. Which shows that people who are so certain of the future so as to use them are more likely to be wrong.
69,@tbr90 @mooncat302 @0xfoobar I guess the question is whether the Punks being bought when/if ETH is $20k is being by people who bought their crypto cheap. NFT-scape may have new entrants but for sure most of it is circular. I can’t imagine most of the market is withdrawing their hard earn life savings to buy
70,@tbr90 @mooncat302 @0xfoobar you can't tell me that people just as easily spend money on real world assets as they do digital ones. 80% of people who hold ETH are still in profit even after a 50% draw down
71,@tbr90 @mooncat302 @0xfoobar Because I think high value NFTs are still mostly bought by people who had ETH in the first place and got it cheap. We mostly think nothing of forking out a few thousand dollars (1 ETH) for a mediocre NFT but wud spend a long time considering a piece of wall art for the same price
72,@tbr90 @mooncat302 @0xfoobar *technical provenance
73,@0xKlinko @tbr90 @mooncat302 @0xfoobar would never happen but imo its bearish because the IP doesnt need to do anything for them to remain valuable. try and add value then that needs to be a constant addition over time.
74,"@tbr90 @mooncat302 @0xfoobar 'Punks compete with other luxury goods'. Hmm you say this as a statement. imo their association is less to do with being a luxury good than a collectors item for their technicality provenance within Eth. If NFTs/Eth fall out of favour, I highly doubt Punks USD price remains high"
75,@mooncat302 @0xfoobar @tbr90 I doubt USD price of Punks will be as important as the ETH price if NFTs and Ethereum are still hugely popular in 5 years. Punks will likely remain priced in ETH. 110 ETH no matter what ETH price in USD would be very cheap imo

78,@Madge_80 its a good talking point but I dont think decentralised crypto will ever fully replace the current financial system but if it does then likely it will be controlled by DAOs that can vote on how it flows. Difficult really to predict how it all evolves
79,"@Jorgeschneide64 Like humanity itself. Whilst over time there are serious, catastrophic blips, we still strive forwards on an overall positive path. Like global poverty for example on the decline..
https://t.co/UOMvbKBCLb https://t.co/4CUAfN25zh"
80,to say its only beneficial to the wrong people would be such an obvious move by the fiat elite to hang onto their control. Crypto is at a crucial testing point now and I've no doubt that it will be proven to be more beneficial for good over bad. But we have to show that in force.
81,@walruswins I get the token exists but whats the story behind it? Can Cool Cat owners claim it?
82,Some people are bearish on crypto because they fear that US and EU will ban it to try and stop Russia from benefiting from it. But on the flipside if we carry on donating en masse to Ukraine via crypto then tht would be a terrible move to ban it. Crypto is beneficial for the good
83,"@walruswins wait, whats MILK?"
84,It’s virtually impossible to guarantee where the flow of money is going. But that doesn’t mean you stop sending for the chance that a portion of it *might* go wayward. The flow of money is one of the most powerful tools.. as seen by the action of SWIFT. Don’t stop donating.
85,@lemiscate Hard disagree. imo we can be pretty sure that in these times that money will be going directly to the war effort. https://t.co/vHCp7D8cBG

87,Interesting. I was going to suggest that perhaps projects done exactly this with the massive treasures they have and don’t know what to do with. But it’s fair enough I guess.
