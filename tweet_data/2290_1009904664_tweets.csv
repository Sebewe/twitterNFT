0,Sooooo is the cool pets reveal this week or next year?
1,"@jrcashhh @doodles This happened to lemons, something beautiful and free and it to anyone that owned a lemon and nothing happened, In fact it pushed the price down a little bit, but I do think we are in a bear market NFT wise"
2,"@davidradi85 @LittlelemonsNFT I think this is true man! And that’s what scares me, the market is already massively oversaturated, and now there are absolutely tons of new projects coming out consistently every single day, it’s just never going to stop lol massively oversaturated"
3,"@process_smith Man I appreciate the love, if I’m honest I’m a bit more of a dog person but I do love cats too! But sometimes some cats can be super selective With who they want near them which can be quite admirable ha ha!"
4,"The floor has kept dropping over the past 5 to 6 weeks, the unique hold account has increased but the floor has kept dropping, and a lot of projects that made gains have slowly lost them!"
5,"Yeah I would definitely say we are definitely in a bear market right now, that doesn’t help also with people chucking money into horrific projects and cash grabs! I might be biased but I love @LittlelemonsNFT but despite a great community of people, and a daily show https://t.co/qXp0XGb8jt"
6,GM https://t.co/xsa63dKlZV
7,Dogs dogs dogs! But no cats 🤣😂 not one person has asked for a cat! https://t.co/6jXsg5Bdpj
8,"@hipstereth 😂🤣😂 i’ve made a project, why am I not rich?!"
9,@Gee__Gazza @WeatheReportNFT Nail on head
10,@DentedFeelsNFT are flying!! 😬👏
11,@Dilby24692557 😂🤣
12,This is a sleeve from maybe 4 years ago!  I LOVE doing sleeves! https://t.co/Vxjnvvmr0W
13,RT @beaniemaxi: Pixelmon does a $70m sale and reveals about $70 worth of collectible value. Parallel doing a pack drop after raking in tens…
14,"@cyphstrain @Helloimmorgan @DumpsterDorks Those look sick! And I do believe a lot of artists are in this because they love to be creative and it is a great way for them to make a living from their art, it’s just super sad that it’s generally centred around money, it wasn’t so much at the start but it definitely is now"
15,"@Pyr3xN @Helloimmorgan Like I am a happy person, bite things have changed here for me anyway and I’m finding it harder to stay in the space!"
16,"@Pyr3xN @Helloimmorgan Which for me is sad because I love to create, I wanted to create my own community and project, I am an artist and I love being creative, but I just don’t know if I can sit with the space, it just seems really fake to me but I might just be generated, I am a super positive person"
17,"@Pyr3xN @Helloimmorgan It’s crazy, the amount of people are used to tell about it, are used to get super hyped about it to people, and now I’m actually considering little day in what I have and going back to life the weight was in June last year when I didn’t know what this space was"
18,"@Helloimmorgan Ordered a $75 @Pudgy_Penguins jumper in October last year…….still haven’t got it lol 

Multi million pound company, I’ve emailed them several times and even spoke directly to Cole, but still nothing and I’m still none the wiser are! 😂🤣"
19,"@Helloimmorgan It’s a scary place for people just stepping into it, I know tons of people IRL Who have asked about it, and months ago I would be happy to tell them, but now I’m just not sure which is sad because I do love the space but it’s waning slowly"
20,"@Helloimmorgan I know this might seem negative, and negativity is not very well received in this space, but somebody has to be calling out just how low effort everything is at the moment! I have screenshot it tons of projects that are all pretty much similar in style"
21,"@Helloimmorgan It’s just a strange space, it’s turning more and more into a shit show as the months move forward, I used to love it back in July, august last year, But now nothing is different, it’s all been regurgitated, and it’s literally all applied to take people’s money off them!"
22,"@Helloimmorgan I mean pretty much most of the projects that are out are all low effort and quite similar, There is just far too many projects coming out who apparently all have the best communities, who is communities or become in twined eventually and all end up collaborating with each other"
23,"@UnstoppableBeef @MotionMarkus @InvsbleFriends This is pure gold, I can’t wait to see this! Without a shadow of a doubt you will sell out and become super rich just like everyone else 🤣😂🤣 squeezing money from da playas of da web3 game!"
24,"Madness!?! Is this even going to happen? Surely it took @MotionMarkus months and months to create @InvsbleFriends 

How can this deriv artist compete? 

Crazy space! https://t.co/ZG1fORiTll"
25,"@Bullishbit @StarcatchersNFT There will be loads of opportunity’s, it never stops, endless projects brother all with the best community’s 🙏 all waiting for our money!"
26,"In this space people will throw money at pretty much anything though!? 🤷 nothing much surprises me anymore, A creator can be racist and people will still find a way around it and throw money at a project, the pixelmon team are rich AF right now! So who are the real losers here? https://t.co/GrK68f0sre"
27,This is the way! Tons of fun to do!! #tattoo #tattooart #mando #Mandalorian #StarWars #tattooartist https://t.co/IxHwQhoX7A
28,This dude LOVES live gigs! So I did this for him! It was super fiddly!! https://t.co/rbuFfeROoL
29,"Cash grabs everywhere, as far as the eye can see! https://t.co/GcpArml90I"
30,"RT @degenbetty: Sometimes we forget that flipping NFTs is essentially just gambling, which is literally addicting. Our brain will keep look…"
31,@dropacid8 The layering on this is shocking! Lol
32,The layering on this multi million dollar NFT is shocking 😬🤣 https://t.co/rnEyw5jOXo
33,"@PuffYatty Wow never realised how bad that layering is!? That I just disappears into the hair, should definitely be in front of hair 😬"
34,I think this could be one of my favourites! As always the better the picture the better the painting! Just a few more paintings to go now and I will be done! Thank you everyone for your patience! PEACE! #liquidacrylic https://t.co/5YRywniL64
35,@withhearts @WeatheReportNFT @Omi_WR Dude be careful you will get cancelled for having an opinion
36,@MichaelRippe Your a legend sir
37,Everybody’s community is the best community
38,"Everything, and I mean absolutely everything has to be positive, it’s so strange! Even when people have different opinions they get shutdown because freedom of speech seems to have been forgotten within the space. All pos no neg (AT ALL) NOPE! Can’t seem to be negative! 🧏‍♂️"
39,"I feel like if anybody within the web3 space tweets or speaks out about something and it even has the slightest connotation of being a little bit negative, regardless of what is being said it is not accepted with this community, and the person is instantly lambasted!"
40,@OttoSuwenNFT But @WeatheReportNFT need paying 🙏
41,🙏 https://t.co/ra7ARtknNZ
42,Chipping away on this Chest piece for Colin!! Having so much fun with this and I think we are going to move up to the shoulders as well! Heavily influenced by the legendary @jasonbutcher per colins request!! https://t.co/pp0baawegI
43,This whole space is fucking strange https://t.co/2rvRtcPuVj
44,@Helloimmorgan Your rich
45,@SageStormDavis @coldpizza_eth Offfffft!
46,RT @0x_fxnction: Everyone thinks the art is ugly until the floor price is high
47,@IamSpoofs @BWiggan Thank you so much Spoofsy!!! 🙏
48,A wolf today for the formidable @bwiggan good to see you man!! https://t.co/5Nswq8gzNS
49,This is how you drop Merch *cough cough* *doodles* *cough cough* https://t.co/rrE3V5vxjH
50,@P_plus8 I feel you man
51,@derpchang Same but different lol
52,"Tubby cats
Potato pals
Broccoli bro’s 
Banana buddy’s
Bunnie buddy’s 

WHEN WILL THIS ALL END lol

Such a crazy space man! 🤯 weird as f&amp;£k"
53,@calumtattoos Yeah man it was incredible! A really good conversation!
54,"@WillBHoldin @CryptoGekyume @doodles Nooooo more classy like this, The bottom is there Merch drop is low effort, it’s couldn’t be anymore low effort I just hope for $120 it’s good quality https://t.co/vSDF6YgvEj"
55,@moonboi24 @MrJamesonNeat @doodles @poopie @burnttoast @evankeast 😬😂
56,@SteveG60117 Especially for $120 per Hoodie
57,"@SteveG60117 I mean the lemons did it, I personally think minimalistic Merch is a bit of a copout, when you look at how the hundreds have done their drops with the bored ape yacht club and deadfellaz, Doing really minimal staff is a copout in my opinion"
58,"Finally finished this for @taracullen97 this was fun to do, hard to make something so dark have form! But loved it! I will send this out to you tomorrow! I have two more paintings to do! #paintingoftheday #painting https://t.co/nDYFdlJUtZ"
59,"@r00tkey @MrJamesonNeat @doodles @poopie @burnttoast @evankeast Yeah the low effort part didn’t hit well here did it ha ha! And I don’t really think there could be any other way to make this any more low effort the more I think about it, Next step would be just a black Hoody or a pink T-shirt with doodles written on the inside"
60,@MrJamesonNeat @doodles @poopie @burnttoast @evankeast https://t.co/F4tJCzbMta
61,@MrJamesonNeat @doodles @poopie @burnttoast @evankeast Exactly! I was expecting something else and I’m gutted but it is what it is and hopefully soon in the future something will drop from this project which I love and they will take my money of me ha ha!
62,"@MrJamesonNeat @doodles @poopie @burnttoast @evankeast Yeah man that’s fine if you think I don’t understand, but I still I’m allowed to feel what I feel about the merchandise, in my honest opinion the merchandise that burnt toast has on his website is where there should have been pushing towards which is why I bought from there"
63,"@MrJamesonNeat @doodles @poopie @burnttoast @evankeast So regardless of how people feel about just how low effort the merchandise is (which is disappointing because I really was looking forward to the drop) we shouldn’t be disappointed because people are talking about the project, people were already talking about the project ha ha!"
64,"This is my thoughts exactly, low effort and quite disappointing, on the other hand @burnttoast has some amazing Merch on his website! Go go go! https://t.co/7mWNm3eg5P"
65,I hate being underwhelmed by a Merch drop from one of my most favourite projects 💔so much potential
66,Cool pets reveal….is it next week or next month? 😅
67,I can’t help but think that this is true!something is happening elsewhere to take our eyes the real prize https://t.co/jDAGDPtNOy
68,@coldpizza_eth ❤️
69,@Penguin3555 😂 you legend! Also all jokes aside on what you just posted bravo on what you have done for the Noundles! You were in there from the very start and I’m new from the interactions with you but you were way more competent than David and avenge!
70,"@Penguin3555 Wow! You’re such a legend, i can’t believe  you would do something like this for the community! Super bullish on you lol 😊🤪 #eltoncares"
71,@zachgoeshard Who wrote this for you?
72,Mannnnn I knew I didn’t get good vibes from Zach! But @WeatheReportNFT will probably still sell out lol https://t.co/x6QMwMzHb6
73,"I don’t think people can actually sit with eth in the MM lol the pull is too real, people can’t resist the next opportunity to flip!………eh what’s that?? Broccoli bro’s?! Sounds legit take my money!  CRAZY SPACE 😂🤣😂 https://t.co/iZL7Uc09cS"
74,THE BASE OF A CHARACTER IS THE MOST CREATIVE PART IMO @Dentinmyhead im with you
75,@FreeMrktCptlst FMC you da best man!
76,"RT @Zeneca_33: horrendously disrespectful behaviour from @zachgoeshard and @nevermindwill 

if you part ways with an artist, for whatever r…"
77,@Zeneca_33 @zachgoeshard @nevermindwill Man I AGREE WITH YOU!! Horrible stuff!
78,@coldpizza_eth AMEN!
79,@coldpizza_eth @WeatheReportNFT Yes they have BUT they will sell out and become millionaires
80,"@SageStormDavis I have to agree with you, they can say whatever they want but the bottom line is that he created the base character, there seems like there is a lot of aggression coming from Zach in my opinion, and that defensive tactic tells me that the truth is not being told"
81,"I’m not down on this with @WeatheReportNFT 

Zach is just skating around the fact that this guy drew the BASE character which is THE single most important part of the art!

He seems aggressive towards making his point be heard that he thought of the name and idea….."
82,Ummmm I get weird vibes from Zach from WR

85,"@_scryptur_ @zachxbt @Helloimmorgan Lose money left right and centre, get these influences at least apologise, spend a few days away from the screen and then come back and carry on regardless!"
86,"@_scryptur_ @zachxbt @Helloimmorgan Yeah man it’s absolutely ridiculous! The situation with people then cool get exploited by themselves and they cannot resist it! This space is a scary space! But just because we are trying to push Geoff out and people, but because there is actual money involved and people"
