this may very well be the beginning of WWIII. Putin has gone mad"

7,@mr_intuition Agreed. what a shitshow we’re in rn
8,"@JetSetTogether hoping you and your family are safe!
I’d love to hear your thoughts on the situation"
9,"@mr_intuition guess we’ll find out soon, I think they will be forced to raise them with these inflation levels https://t.co/EcpNQ81fbg"
10,"gonna be a bumpy ride till the Fed confirms what they will do with rates. they should hike them, but surging energy costs due to Russia crisis and current admin bad policy will make it tough to do so"
11,"@cory_eth @pixelvault_ was the first I saw do this with the Mint Pass and @MetaHero_ mint 
Game theory is involved as well cause a Mint Pass is used for Core giveaways and needed to complete a PV Set."
12,RT @FenDAO_: According to @brydisanto most recent alpha game stats @FenDAO_ is still one of the highest +EV packs out there! With that said…

14,@KeyboardMonkey3 @tubbycatsnft thanks boss
15,@Loopifyyy @MoonOverlord @sartoshi_nft 🤝this response is making me bullish ngl
16,"@Loopifyyy @MoonOverlord @sartoshi_nft not fading..just saying your an influencer in the space and usually those type of projects don't do well. i enjoy your content and i've come close to buying treeverse due to the work i've seen from the team.
prove me wrong 😁"
17,"@MoonOverlord gotcha 👍 i think of mfers as more of being artist led. @sartoshi_nft has a history of his stick figure character and selling them as NFTs so i wouldn't put him in that category.
@Loopifyyy def in that category, which makes me skeptical on treeverse..but it looks legit AF"
18,"@MoonOverlord sounds like that means you would only buy influencer led projects, which have almost all failed 🥴"

22,@0xBender i made bags. was mostly cause i was worried Coinbase would release and cause it to tank quickly…apparently couldn’t even make it that long 😬
23,"@steven_schill not surprised. wasn’t related to staking $WOOL like many expected.
This new event is exciting as it gives creators a chance to win more $WOOL for them and team of choice. WOOLISHHH 🐺"

25,"@tylerklose kinda confusing rn, hard to tell. But I think that will change. I’ve seen polls say minorities are more likely to buy crypto than whites, but then videos like this. I’ve heard Trump say BTC is dangerous but also the left say it’s killing the environment and starting war https://t.co/DlCkyNJ8Gu"
26,@ToonCarsnft hell yeah
27,"@ASvanevik need the ability to pay rent/mortgage, utilities, insurance with stablecoins via a wallet. more avenues to buy real estate with digital assets.

these are what keep me from going completely bankless"
28,"@jebus911 they didn’t even teach Econ at my high school, no wonder I ended up a degen"
29,"@_bassen_ - also BAYC at 0.7 😏
- minted 20 Cool Cats (still holding 4 rares)
- $WOOL at 0.03"

35,"@davidbankless ...on the flip side, the Shep has gained my respect with his ability to continue to deliver and i don't mind the mystery of the Shep and team. The community is so strong and continues to build out content that should help newcomers. The game will speak for itself, without mkting"
36,"@davidbankless I'm worried that they are being too secretive and it could turn people away..how big is the dev team, are they expanding or plan to? will there be a marketing push when full game is deployed? will it be too complicated for many to follow and a lack of guidance/tutorials to learn?"
37,@ka_dewaal just got announced https://t.co/eZ55mlS3F8
38,@ka_dewaal same week as NFT NYC https://t.co/NORc7SWrRu
39,"@katienotopoulos what made you think it's right to dox these individuals against their will, while digging for ""red flags"". they have been nothing but great leaders in the NFT space where anonymity is part of the culture.
shame on you https://t.co/A5aHGaaTXu"
40,"@DillyDilly_eth might dip a little more cause of this ETH run, but overall a great project imo https://t.co/TqweK06IgC"
41,"@topshotfund agreed, most of the 3D pfps have small details that don’t work well when shrunken down into a typical profile dimension"
42,"@PuffYatty Absolutely.
- Paid off over $20k of debt trading NFTs
- Left my stressful 9-5 job to do something that I truly enjoy
- I learn something new everyday in this space…it’s never boring"

46,@icesometric @KarafuruNft gotcha. just seems like they are limiting their community by not increasing the size to match the demand. this increases the fomo and usually leads to a big pump that’s hard to sustain..
47,"@KarafuruNft you have 100k+ followers and I’m sure a loaded discord, why such a low supply at ~5k?"
48,"@trevorjonesart it’s still very much the wild wild west and some points in here aren’t wrong. But it’s clear this is a NFT hit piece…
“we are forced to suffer more obtrusive attempts to entice us”
🥲🤣 what a joke https://t.co/q4cPggdutT"
49,"@NFTbark @wolfdotgame 
Constant communication with the community (never more than 2 days without a tweet, usually daily) and most of the times a GIF is attached that is later auctioned off as an NFT in a live event that burns $WOOL"
50,"@DoctorHazmat yeah, a lot of gamers were screwed by micro txns, loot boxes, DLC, etc. and probably think this is similar so I could see that concern. just sucks to see people in his position not do the research and see the benefits"
51,"@wolfdotgame GIFs are back, LFG"

55,@RahulChhabrani @BoredApeYC stuck on this one too 🤕
56,@NFT_Shooter @R2theOME I could be very wrong too. The team is strong and minting contract was impressive. Good luck I hope you get that 10x 👍
57,@NFT_Shooter ok bud. I can provide you plenty of cash grabs that turned out poorly that had high mint prices and then FREE mints that’s have been wildly successful. mint price does not matter
58,@NFT_Shooter Just seems like hype is pumping the project up before the team has delivered much. Which is similar to these above. Mint price being higher doesn’t mean much to me. I minted cool cats for .02 ETH 😂
59,@BoredApeYC still hoping I can creep my way into the Top 100 for the bong 😅💨🙏 https://t.co/f6C7IsFIWs
60,@osf_nft 💯 diversified portfolio is the way to go
61,"@elektrikerjavel @SVSNFT I take it u meant *against people who cheat.
I don't think these capitalists are necessarily cheating, they are just taking advantage of a bad system to get spots to buy an NFT. I think some projects just don't care tbh, and their only goal is sellout as quickly as possible."
62,"@TheShamdoo Nah. I think a utility token is only useful if the team can develop a worthwhile game to play that uses the token.
If not, the token will just pump n dump and then people will call the project a scam.
Could do more harm than good for some projects."
63,"@elektrikerjavel @SVSNFT Interesting. I do think with some of these high profile, extremely marketed launches that some type of raffle system might be a good option. Although there will still be loopholes, like someone hiring a ton of people to enter the raffle, which i think happened in Mekaverse raffle"
64,@StonedApe4434 👀
65,"@Wappy_eth yeah, it's getting crazy. some are also artificially pumping other worthless projects, by using the scheme of if you hold this NFT, you qualify for a whitelist 😒"
66,"@xBenJamminx thanks for sharing, this was on my radar but I never pullled the trigger 🤦‍♂️
what is the future or current utility for $LOOMI ?"
67,"@ZechNFT Hahaha yeah, hate this part with this Ape. Best strat for me was to boost straight into the mutant as your throwing the bottles so that they land as he’s turning around to chase you"
68,@effutrollme @VitalikButerin hahah basically. he mentioned something about future people being able to live for 100s of years 🤯

73,"@illewminatus @wolfdotgame @EtherOrcs I simply analyzed the new alpha game contract that came out for @wolfdotgame ser.
I've only heard good things about @EtherOrcs and if they helped The Shepherd in anyway, great 👍"
74,@fren721 @wolfdotgame https://t.co/YHWiTrhutz
75,@tropoFarmer @LilHeroesNFT that’s a big no no
76,@WWMLD idk what to make of it..just a discovery
77,"@huck_doge Nah, liquid $wool staked in the game will be minted back you to your wallet whenever you unstake.

The Pouches will simply be your rewards based on the animals/NFTs and $WOOL you had staked during the Game."
78,"@wolfinplainview @beaniemaxi @wolfdotgame Yeah, sounds like once staked the WOOL will be burned, with your 'stake' amount saved and then minted once you unstake. Looks like its to reduce gas on the initial stake. Pretty genius move"
79,"@p0k3rN3rd Here's part of that note, which brings more context:
""As soon as a token is unstaked, it will reset its points but its pack's points wont be reduced...the sum of points for individual stakes will be less than the total points for the pack, leading to an unclaimable portion."""

85,@boredapebot someone just got finessed
86,@beaniemaxi Yes. i like this move. Don't give them more money
87,"@jackieayran Heck yess
This started my journey. After seeing the manipulation with GME/AMC stocks I fled to crypto/NFTs. Life changing experience ever since 🙌"
88,@machiavillain_1 i would be https://t.co/PeY2yyajNa
89,"@ape_g4ng I think both will do well long run, but Cool Cats higher upside rn with Eggs, $MILK, gamification coming in Q1"
90,"@TakeoffTone @InvsbleFriends 😅
And we’ve done like a billion dollars in volume on OpenSea.
Creators should be taking advantage, now is the time to shine 🙌"
91,"@Hazardmade Yeah, I’m definitely starting to see it that way now"
92,@economist I did this with Cool Cats and was rewarded heavily. Totally agreed

97,@swartzcenter Yes. more than my salary at my old 9-5
98,"@ajv my guess would be MAYC on run up to $APE release,
then Cool Cats on run up to Egg and $MILK release"
