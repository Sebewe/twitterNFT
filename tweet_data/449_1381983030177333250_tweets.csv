30,@Notchippyy Very important lesson.
31,"@featureshoot @gallegosfer @EddiJonesNFT The key difference between the bricks and mortar and this space is the power of the photographers. The tastemaking is decentralized, and much more in the hands of creators. This will increase over time with the secondary royalties. How it should be."
