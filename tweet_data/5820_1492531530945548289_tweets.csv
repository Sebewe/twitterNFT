17,There are so many amazing women-led projects in this space right now it's getting hard to choose which ones to mint. This def wasn't the case a few months ago and I'm so happy they're finally getting the recognition they deserve!💜@worldofwomennft @WomenTribe_nfts @WomenriseNFT

23,"WHICH MEME COIN SHOULD I BUY? (PT.2) 👇 since the last poll was tied, we're doing a new one with the two finalists #SHIB #SHIBARMY &amp; #BABYDOGE!  i'll giveaway 10% of whatever I end up buying... you know what to do 🤑"
24,We're fairly certain this is due to the new contract migration from opensea so please MAKE SURE TO REVOKE PERMISSIONS... instructions below... rt and be safe y'all 🙏 https://t.co/r8m4CSe5t0
25,"i typically use https://t.co/9BC6ZVH11i but it's currently getting spammed with everyone trying to revoke permissons from #x2y2 and #opensea... if you can't get onto it, try this instead https://t.co/dfKYDw1OFi"
26,"🚨 OPENSEA WALLETS GETTING HACKED🚨
THIS IS HUGE: Some wallets are being drained of all their NFTs! Has to do with the recent opensea contract migration and the x2y2 contract. If you interacted with either of these, REVOKE NOW 👇 #NFTCommunity #NFT https://t.co/1k3PgMjBVv"
27,@MoonJaesong what's the story behind $MONA? never heard of it
28,i think it's finally time for me to ape into a meme coin. which one should i get? looking at the top 5 rn...🤑#DOGE #SHIB #BABYDOGE #ELON #KISHU
29,@olgafedorova112 it's scary how realistic this looks..
30,"i will buy all the $LOOKS you have at 300m market cap, bring it on"
31,"@icy_tools @nansen_ai @raritytools @wgmiio 5. leaving this one out intentionally for your suggestion. if you haven't heard of @rarity_sniffer, definitely take a look. this will give you the rarity of NFTs moments before they reveal and give you a real edge over the competition. you'll need a premium subscription, though!"
32,"@icy_tools @nansen_ai @raritytools 4. @wgmiio
great tool to aggregate your nft collection and see how much the entirety of your nft collection is worth. you'll also get to see how prices for your nfts have moved over time."
33,"@icy_tools @nansen_ai 3. @raritytools 
if you're going to buy an nft or if you've already one, you'll want to find out how rare it is to determine its value. here you'll get a detailed breakdown of rare traits for a lot of collections and become a smarter buyer/seller. also good to see upcoming nfts."
34,"@icy_tools 2. @nansen_ai 
similar to the last one, step above but more expensive. you can literally get every sales metric ever and even track wallets to see what whales are buying. try it out for a week for 9$, but any more than that and you're dishing ~$100 per month."
35,"1. @icy_tools
one of the most useful free tools if you want to see which collections are hot in the #NFT market right now. you can find out which collections have been minting out the fastest over the last 24 hour, and even 1h. super useful if your strategy is to follow trends."
