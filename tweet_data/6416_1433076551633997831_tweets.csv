37,What are peoples thoughts on @veve_official ? I’m skeptical personally
38,I should really have an alt account for all the giveaways I enter on here but I’m too shameless
39,@to_fkn_zero Honestly bro I can’t deal with anymore of the bullshit it’s becoming a joke and putting people off the space completely
40,I have love for other projects in my wallet but from an insider perspective I can see how much growth is about to happen over the next while. Shoutout to all the developers on all these projects💯
41,There’s only a handful of projects I hold that I truly see doing well in this lighting market that changes trends daily and they are @SmolBrainsNFT @CyberTurtlesNFT @REBEL_BOTS . Cyber turtles and rebel bots are still at a good entry price but won’t be for long
42,@to_fkn_zero The whole situation is shady and all the conspiracys of how this happened are speculative rn. I’m looking forward to finding out exactly what went on
43,I’m gonna be honest. 99% of the projects that I have gotten into lately have all been just flips and that’s all well and good in the short term but it just shows how flat the market is getting. The market is crying out for something innovative
