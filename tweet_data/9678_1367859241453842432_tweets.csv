8,"@KarlDHarrison Stores here will get you arrested for trespassing if you wont wear a mask. exemption or not.
Obviously if you refuse to leave."
9,@Richard_S_Y @IrishAmerican27 @jcrichman @RVnGrammy @natsechobbyist @juliaioffe @stranahan You're the insane one.
10,@KarlDHarrison That's why store owners use trespass as an excuse to get rid of us. Most won't bother going after them. I won't be supporting many business at this point.
11,@KarlDHarrison Isn't that already in the charter of rights and freedom?
12,@web4_point_0 Would be great if people took the time. Thanks for sharing.
13,"@web4_point_0 that I totally agree on. But why are they pushing this? Bring in digital currency? Collapse banking by ""hackers"" Crash the petro dollar? Ukraine is controlled by corruption? Why all the fake propaganda? We as pawns don't have all the clues yet."
14,@web4_point_0 Just in general. Not all is at it seems here.
15,@web4_point_0 Make sure you know what the war is about and who are the actual players as well.

Until you can stop the manufacturing of drugs, you will not get anywhere with this. 
And like I said before, there is too much money being made on both sides of the ""law""

It's great you believe in a cause and fight for it."
72,"@bit180 @Rojo_Rocks I have no sympathy for addicts. 
 
Too much money is being made by all sides to end the manufacturing and trafficking of drugs.

Give everyone a job that pays enough to have a good living will do better than anything else you can think of."
