12,@freedelivery96 I hope so !! 💐
13,@AlphaDroids Lol that would be awesome
14,@psychedelic_nft how is it possible to be this horrified and excited at the same time?!
15,@WeldNFT Well you can troll them in a few years when you say “I told you so” about NFTs
16,@CryptoChthonic Omg haha I love that!! Sounds like it was successful
17,@jojotramm Me too!! So far it’s worked for a few friends ☺️
18,"@faderjoes Yes, they really are to find!! So lucky I have a few 🥰"
19,@metaboners Mostly showing them the NFTs I have and explaining the utility behind good projects
20,@jojotramm Sounds like both experiences were mostly a success!
