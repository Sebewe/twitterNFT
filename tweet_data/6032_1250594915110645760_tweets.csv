42,"4/ As a web3 founder it is important to be intentional. 

Surround yourselves with people whose values are aligned with yours and who have the same vision of web3 that you do. You should be given the freedom to build and test and execute your ideas"
43,"3/ The technology behind NFTs is powerful. We’re going to see NFTs be used in a lot more ways.

Both the deed to your house and your reservation at a restaurant will be an NFT. And that's b/c they have a clear &amp; transparent track record of ownership. And it will all belong to you"
44,"2/ Social tokens are going to be huge b/c they allow new forms of monetization of content. They will become a significant feature of this next wave. 

As technology continues to evolve, social tokens will be accepted by larger communities, such as publishers, products, or brands"
45,"1/ The role of a community member means so much more now than ever before because ownership is replacing fandom.

A community member is your most powerful marketing tool, your most important stakeholder, and your most accurate metric for how the brand is performing"
