2,"What @sbreakintl has been busy with since the last few days - and where did I dissapear, in one single thread. https://t.co/fgl2HsS2fD"
3,"@ur3php Follow me back, please. I need to DM you."
4,The last few days have been crazy and it is not yet near completion... I am proud of everyone at @sbreakintl and our partners for the amazing intelligence work is being done. Clearly saving lifes.
5,"@megs_io We do not censor anything. For now, we mainly try to make it easier for our customers to access geospatial intelligence in a easier way than what currently exist. We streamline the entire process etc..."
6,@megs_io Google Earth has the highest commercial imagery resolution available (30cm/px) but the processing of the imagery and compression makes the image look bad. We have also 30cm/px but we don’t have to compress and process weirdly so quality is much higher
7,"@megs_io We can take videos from space, see at night, see through clouds, ..."
8,@megs_io And partners
9,"@0xKeaman Wrong subject, especially when those kind of mappings also help NGOs on site to help civilians in a better way. I will not engage in those subjects, clearly not what my tweets are speaking about. Don't deviate."
10,"I wish everyone affected by the current situation, good luck. My prayers and thoughts are with you."
11,"Through intelligence gathered, we were able to help some of our sources in currently affected area before escalation started. We are keeping an active eye on the situation and looking to bring further capabilities within the affected areas."
12,"Following serious,unique and historical geopolitical situation &amp; my involvment through @sbreakintl, my online presence will be decreasing until further notice. 

My work within the NFT space is obviously still very much active - I am just less present online."
13,@AnthonyMcG2 Been so much time! It was amazing to see you again

YEAH. It took that long."

27,@benJhoffner HAPPY BIRTHDAY 2 uuuu
28,@dragonsoul_nft @KRosenberg22 @steveb_crypto Always good to learn! Thank you ☺️
29,@dragonsoul_nft @KRosenberg22 @steveb_crypto I have absolutely no clues what that means 🤔
30,@stavang3r Big things are clearly coming
31,"@justOfek https://t.co/YFAuDtw3iX

Fixed, thank you for the heads up!"
32,LINK IS BROKEN - Here is the proper one: https://t.co/0JI6KBj3tb
33,"Make sure to check Etherscan token checker to revoke any contract you have no clues about. A good OPSEC strategy is to do that continuously and/or revoke contracts access when you finished using them.

34,"It is extremely sneaky and hard to understand since it happens in a simple Metamask notification that we usually accept, almost out of muscles memory."
35,"What is interesting about this phishing attack is that unlike Web2, where the goal is to get your username and password, this one targets your wallet directly by approving their own smart contracts which gives them extensive control over your NFTs."
36,"It look like the attacker(s) had a very sophisticated phishing attack, by mimicking OpenSea in many ways, through similar looking website to email."
37,"I am waking up to calls that OpenSea got hacked - it does not seems that way. 

Here is a quick analysis (just woke up) and way to protect yourself 👇"
38,@v8lkn Who said that’s not work? 🐧
39,Working 🌞 and 🌚
40,@art_sofly 😂😂😂😂🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧
41,@soldthebottom Super cool! I did the Dubai Mall one yesterday and Emirates Mall today. Both are amazing - the Emirates Mall experience allow you to touch them tho which is super cool
42,Penguin https://t.co/5Az2KNESyd
43,@Schluebba_LoL Sadly I stopped after  the last few extensions. The lore lost too much appeal once Arthas got killed.
44,@m3t4ch34t Ultima Online ❤️
45,@Dropbear07 @playlostark But the server queuing is less intersting 😭😭😭😭
46,"@ycxchoy If you look at the technical aspect, we did not build @oncyber_io , we are using them to add our brand to their experience, for example."
47,"@ycxchoy I get you. We are more ""adding"" to what exist than building ""the metaverse"" as we are a brand - it is an important aspect of our pov to have."
48,"@ycxchoy because we are a brand, not a video game studio"
49,"@ycxchoy We are a fashion brand, that is very different, not a video game studio. It is not comparable."
50,"@ycxchoy I don't see how? Again, the examples of MMO I took don't need crazy hardware. And any blockchain layer of the top would not requier anything on the user side."
51,"@ycxchoy But that is the thing: the new term is just how to democratize MMORPG. A metaverse is an immersive video game with social and economics aspects.

Does immersion require VR ? Absolutely not. It is a +, but not mandatory."
52,@RTFKTLukson @Nikgopalani You are an OG &lt;3
53,@RTFKTLukson @Nikgopalani TFT with the fight or Arthas and Illidan in front of the Frozen throne in Northrend 🥰
54,@Nikgopalani https://t.co/z5ozGafXyY
55,@Laxmuffins @nftworldsNFT Still no need for a VR headset 😂
56,FACT : I did not need a VR headset to feel immersed when playing World of Warcraft.
57,"@Asplander Don’t worry, everything will go well 👁👄👁"
58,"@ycxchoy I highly disagree with you, especially on point 1."
59,"World of Warcraft, Lineage 2, Runescape, ... all were metaverse. A metaverse is nothing else than an MMO with social and economics. The blockchain layer on the top of it is just the logical continuity but should never be the focus of how immersion is created."
60,@beaniemaxi @bryanbrinkman Exactly. I am quite dissapointed about that. They keep minting new lands on new islands. And price is adjusting to USD instead of being fixed to ETH.
61,@duncanblaise_MV People don’t grasp it just yet. I fully agree with you
62,@rayan_oncyber Gm degen
63,I can’t wait for the moment when the power of smart contracts starts to be fully understood and leveraged. We are at 0.1% of the innovation that NFT brings 👀
64,@Tschuuuuly @_Raster_Eyes_ Fitting the red LED 👀 The V2 btw is being currently listed by the new owner
65,"@ddaavvee1234 @_Raster_Eyes_ Quick rectification, it was 4am, re-reading my tweet: I sold this one like announced in one of my old tweet. But still have other v2"
66,@_Raster_Eyes_ V1
67,@lunargistics &lt;strong&gt;
68,"@saffakaneraNFT Learn how to code with focusing on memory optimisation. Something like C++ or Javascript with TypeScript is a good start! And when you feel confident enough, I recommend CryptoZombie as a solidity tutorial"
69,"As I don't want to reply to DMs individually about it, just putting that again: I did review @Oxmose_NFT smart contract and also web server security. They did a really good job ✅ https://t.co/B9KfZ6SYgP"
70,Advise for web developers moving to Solidity: go through TypeScript first to understand strongly typed language.
71,🐧
72,"@ReyCrypto810 Not related to mnlth, I promise xD"
73,@gurandaofuranus There is that too indeed
