67,"@Yasserishmail1 @bhavss14 We are not creating anywhere near enough clear cut chances. This has been a massive criticism of “Artetaball” the #10 he’s used largely in that phase is Odegaard. 

Before Arteta and at start of reign Aubameyang was red hot. He STOPPED getting service a #10 key responsibility"
68,"@Yasserishmail1 @bhavss14 Your defending him as your overly invested in him and clearly a fan (profile picture) ESR and Saka are scoring at more ease as was Martinelli. 

De Bruyne who is the pinnacle in his position ALWAYS has output first. The work rate and other attributes get attention after"
69,"@Yasserishmail1 @bhavss14 Actually the work rate side is secondary. He is a 10. We don’t score enough goals. 

He will always be valued on his output. As it stands he is in the shadows of 2 of his team mates who came from the academy so actually he needs to up his game! 

IMO"
70,@ZaneScotland Red shafts?
71,@Yasserishmail1 @bhavss14 Think that is abit over the top sir.
72,"@bhavss14 Because you got a price right you can’t credit yourself with a win 🤣

A bargain would suggest he’s been bought under value. 

Not sure at £34m he’s a “bargain” just yet pal 👍🏻"
