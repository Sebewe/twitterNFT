49,@0xBuckshot @thegualla We’ve got one side that is trying to go through proper procedures and diplomatic channels before entering conflict &amp; another that is pre-emptively striking and creating ambiguity to provide cover. Baltic countries are already in NATO but Russia won’t attack them due to Article 5
50,@0xBuckshot @thegualla Article 4 allows members to strategize and develop military plans in case they are invaded. Think shifting troops and weapons around to other members. Article 5 would be going to war to defend a member country.
51,@0xBuckshot @thegualla Doubtful. NATO is a defensive organization first and foremost. There will be no war unless NATO members are directly attacked. Next step is to remove Russia from UN charter but China will most likely veto.

91,"@GwpQn @YankovETH @SlimGrim5 @justinavery @the_x2y2 @looksrare it's a market place, not a gallery. it's not that strange for them to want only liquid collections to count towards claiming the airdrop (participating in the ecosystem)"
92,"@DanielSan84_eth @YankovETH @SlimGrim5 @justinavery @the_x2y2 @looksrare more like a tragedy of the commons. the platform was defending its ecosystem by adjusting the requirements. otherwise it would have been dumped into oblivion and their venture would die. if you don't like it, you should move on to the next project."
