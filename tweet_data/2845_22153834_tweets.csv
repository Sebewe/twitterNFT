94,"@Zaptio @RTFKTstudios 2/ thanks for clarifying. A simple FAQ on the CloneX site outlining this would have cleared that up and avoided confusion. 

gl for the rest of the drop today. I genuinely do hope it all goes off smoothly."
95,"@Zaptio @RTFKTstudios 1) which part is not true? The 10.8k rather than 11k? 

My point still holds: Your UX implied that the sale at 3eth is selling much quicker than it is (over 50% in the first few min without making it clear that 10.8k were pre-sold). This appears to be a deliberate design choice."
96,.@RTFKTstudios will recover from their tech mishaps but whether they are able to build a raging loyal community is dependent on how honest &amp; transparent they are with them from here forward. These elements don’t build trust &amp; that is will be a much harder place to recover from.
97,"2/ not specifying clearly on their site (or nowhere that I could find) that any secondary sales has a 10% royalty fee. 

With the amount of promotion of this drop, not highlighting this was a deliberate choice."
98,"1/ the misrepresentation of how many NFTs have been minted in this drop making it seem like it was selling out quicker than it was. 

This purchase screen made it look like 11,847 had already been sold when in fact 11k were already pre-sold. https://t.co/wbEEpuS05y"
99,I’m a big fan of @RTFKTstudios but there were two elements of this drop (outside of the technical difficulties) that I’d have expected more transparency from the team.
