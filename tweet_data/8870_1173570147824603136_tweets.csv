We are talking about both a game and an investment, it is always difficult to make the balance.."
1,"@underwater100x @ParallelNFT If I'm not mistaken the SE's form complete ParaSets that are included to earn $prime. 
Your theory may be right, in fact there was a hype on the first drops that they may have tried to correct."
2,"@underwater100x @ParallelNFT You have people who bought a card for $150,000. It's not Parallel that puts them on sale.  
It's people like you and me. 
Same for the buyer ;)

If you're complaining about the prices, you don't understand what I'm saying and we're not complaining about the same thing."
3,"@underwater100x @ParallelNFT Not rugged, 
But a vault put to store worthless cards... whereas before there was no such thing and we had much better cards.

10 cards for 0.075 but in fact it was totally abused, even the old 0.01 pack with 4 cards were more profitable and most most rare."
4,"@ParallelNFT I had a few things to say every time about the drops.
But this one was the worst in every way, even though you managed to give away 50k packs.
Whether it's the cards themselves or the system, it was better before..."

On the platform side I agree with you.

On the token side they have nothing more, 
+ no rewards for those who give away liquidity. 
From 1,6 to 0,70c in less than two days ( yes the whole market dump but not so fast )
Good Luck , We'll see where it goes"

40,"Despite all the interest I have in this new platform I just dumped all the $X2Y2 I had.
Seriously no rewards for the stakers of the liquidity pool ( only for ILO ) ?
