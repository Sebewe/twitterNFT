69,@__Rubenz__ @JungleFreaksNFT @TrosleyNFT @Crypto_Skulls Seems like the skull market has been bottoming out around 2.5 and hitting a ceiling of 3.3 since last night. Not financial advice bc who knows how long that lasts but I’ve been using it as an opportunity to pick up .5 Eth per trade.
70,@kleskenov @Crypto_Skulls They’re showing an ugly elitist side to this space that was touted as being supportive.
