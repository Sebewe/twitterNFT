68,It's a long road ahead and I'll be here all the way. Thank you for reading🙏🧡🎞️ https://t.co/kswSzdUXCt
69,The plan is to grow a community around my work making each and every negative collected as special as possible. https://t.co/4nL2SmTWBM
70,"Lastly, I want to connect with my collectors and learn about them, holding monthly spaces to catch up and chat about life and the nft world. Without collectors there would be no market for nft’s, so i value them a lot and want to build strong relationships. https://t.co/dMPSjOilsV"
71,Over time i want to see each collection increase in value. I'm very particular with my work and will only create nft’s for photos that I think truly stand out. https://t.co/H94y9hM2Gs
72,"I don't plan on reducing my list prices as I feel artists should stick to what they think their value is, like i mentioned previously this isn't about making money for me. Of course it will help to support me in creating more work, and buying more film though.🙏😍 https://t.co/WDxv0ZYrAy"
73,"My goal is to steadily create unique collections with a small number of 1/1 photos. There will be options for having custom prints included in the nft sales as well. As for me, seeing my work in print is my favorite medium. https://t.co/2VN8Lq5rfh"
74,For me NFT'S are about building a community around my photography. I'm not here to make quick money and disappear. I want to add value to my work by supporting my collectors and communicating with personally. Please read on…. https://t.co/h6Bsd5PDIw
75,@DracheTech11 @Tylers_journey Great work @Tylers_journey!
76,"@monaris Well said, people seem to be undervaluing there work a lot. Stand by what your think your piece is worth, its not a race to sell. The right collector will see the true worth of your nft 🙏🏻"
77,@trevorjphoto Gm!
78,"@Cryptojuiced @jackthestreet @withFND Congrats Jack, thats epic!!"
