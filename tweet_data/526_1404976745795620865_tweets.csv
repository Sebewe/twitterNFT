65,@Mutant16928 @DeFiRod Early adopters definitely pay the price… but web 3 is only going to rival Web 2 if we reward organizations like LR with our eyes and wallets
66,"I love how everyone has been begging for a true web 3 competitor to Opensea, we get Looksrare, OS continues to subject users to security vulnerabilities and y’all still don’t list or buy on LR. It’s like we can’t act in our own best interest as an NFT community 😖"

95,"After some additional thought, who’s to say that 11.11 ETH is too high for an NFT mint? It’s about the artist and the buyer. People increasing the amount of money spent in ETH is good for the ecosystem too — large assets valued in ETH is good for all of us while we’re growing 🚀"
