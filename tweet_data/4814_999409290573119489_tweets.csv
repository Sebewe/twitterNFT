14,Are invisible friends really going for 15 ETH on the secondary?.. Is this going to be another Mekaverse?
15,@cozywyatt The same study also indicated that 12.30% of jpeg traders are liars.

23,"✅The play with $LOOKS was to stake it for a few weeks and sell.

27,@punk6529 @MetaMask @Trezor From what I understand the issue comes from Trezor because they took their time with supporting EIP-712. IIRC Trezor users have had the same issue on LooksRare since they released.
28,This whole thing with @NFTCryptoChicks looks pretty bad... Looks like the artist hasn't just plagiarised the art for this collection but also for other things they minted and sold.
