4,@Ledger @warpsound_ai When you sign a message that does not require gas. The fields message hash and domain hash displays in your ledger. How can you check that the hashes are correct? What do you compare with?

14,@cozywyatt @ohhshiny @doodles @Noodles_NFT Just wondering what the colleration between doodles and noodles will be. Since doodles wont get airdrops. And people that cant afford doodles wont get an alternative to buy.
15,@thewillmauro @ohhshiny @doodles @Noodles_NFT Do you think doodles will buy up noodles?
16,"@cozywyatt @ohhshiny @doodles @Noodles_NFT Wonder if this will be like mayc for bayc. It is not the same founders, but has been supported by the doodle community."
17,@toddtronikNFT @broadspectrum @ohhshiny @doodles @Noodles_NFT Hope the space experience will be awesome for @Noodles_NFT  too!
18,After @ohhshiny and the @doodles  team talk about spacedoodles yesterday. I figured out that @Noodles_NFT also are going to space. Seems like the people that cant afford a doodle are going for a noodle. What are you guys thinking?😁 https://t.co/ukNotaFgsj

42,The problem with all these smartcontract hacks is that it is almost impossible to make them secure and userfriendly as a dev. For a user the problem is that it is almost impossible to verify what you are signing. Maybe @radixdlt and #scrypto can be the solution.
43,@thebiggestfudg3 @econoar @mdudas Ledger would not help
44,@econoar @mdudas How are you able to verify your punk on twitter if you have it in your coldwallet. I guess you signed a message for that?
45,"@BobbyBananasNFT Just check your ledger when you revoke. It says something like set approval for 0, when you are revoking"
46,"@KfishNFT I see that this can be bad practie though as you can sign stuff you dont know about, and in a future event if you for some reason start listing from that acount or approve spending the nfts can be stolen."
47,@Somewherelos @Nofuturephoto @0xfoobar Correct
48,@KfishNFT I see that this is not safe if you have spending approvals for it. (For example on your listning account)
49,"@KfishNFT How do you organize it for your collab land account if you for example want to verify your doodle for discord using collab land?

Wouldnt it be safe to sign a message from your vault as long as it is only a message (i.e no gas fees required.)"
50,"RT @KfishNFT: I am disgusted by what is going on.

People, I beg you, please use the following setup:

51,@MightyCat_ @KfishNFT @karanshah_786 Correct
