Seems fitting in certain situations I guess  😂 #fudders https://t.co/HUQBAdioa9"
2,@tefagamewar @VoyagersGame Thanks for the support!
3,Thanks for the support!  I’ll be here building 👷‍♂️🚀 https://t.co/DoBmLa5WMz
4,"@Jdotcolombo I can whip up the art gen, metadata, smart contract and minting site if you want as long as it’s done after that as I have a game to build during most of my time"
5,gm Voyagers.  A great day to get back into the game code. . .  Working on some pvp so we can multiplayer battle for the first mini game! 🚀
6,@MoonOverlord @VoyagersGame probably nothing then … 👀
7,Demand more from your alphas
8,Sad that large voices in the community would rather talk about (and give engagement to) scams that are trending rather than talk to and about real builders and legit projects …
9,@cr0ssETH Very tough for the real builders 👷‍♂️  especially when most influencers only regurgitate the bad actors ultimately giving them even more exposure and legit projects even less
10,@BobbyBananasNFT @burnpile_eth @Cryptking_1 Community asked me to dox I said watch me build instead
11,If the funds from pixelmon where split amongst 70 projects the space would be a lot more exciting

13,@Hape1713 @SpeculatorArt Id like to know as well but I would guess connections in the space to help it mint out

17,@SneakyninjaNFTs @0xRelay @killergfnft Sneaky vampire syndicate was like this originally last year.  You clicked a button and if you where in the first 8888 collected you then had 8 hours to mint.   It’s the only ‘wl’ I’ve ever made it into 😂
18,@SneakyninjaNFTs @GooodLawdy Kek.
19,@takoa__ @VoyagersGame might not be a top nft project right now but it sure has potential to grow 🚀
20,"@takoa__ Can we shill here at least? 😂. 

@VoyagersGame … probably nothing."
21,"@PopeyesNFTs Take a squizz at @VoyagersGame if you got a few seconds bud, would mean the world 🌎"
22,"@PopeyesNFTs Good for you bud,  tired of seeing influencers just giving scems more exposure that could go towards sleepers that struggle to get seen 🚀"
23,@PopeyesNFTs Hahah! Make it 4.20 and you good fam
24,@jumpmanft Great advice and why I spent the past two months building a demo before even becoming public with the project 🚀
25,@BentoBoiNFT Lol what a classic.  The funniest is those that go to the trouble of minting a fake bored ape contract just to hexagon that shit 😂.
26,"@9x9x9eth This is exactly what I’ve been saying and, I’m building a game that’s almost entirely off-chain.  Would love to pitch it to the OpenDao if they working on similar objectives in terms of minting and ‘upgrading meta’ as the player progresses in the game."
27,"@9x9x9eth Elon can have mars for now, I’ll be here building the metaverse for when he runs out of Cheetos 😂"
28,@ArcanicNFT It’s given me the drive and confidence to build and code every day.
29,"RT @ArcanicNFT: Need to prove a point for an argument.

30,@ArcanicNFT Hehe.  Im going to start playing a bit soon ‘for research purposes’ to help built @VoyagersGame 😂
31,@Hisdudeness121 Wonder which has better open rates on announcements tho 🤔
32,"@DaGoatNFT You don’t follow me … yet, but I ain’t no bot… (yet?)"
33,@Zeneca_33 Sold.  Def buying one of these today to access the course and see how best to take @VoyagersGame forward from a marketing perspective 🚀
34,@Helloimmorgan To support the development of the space … 🚀
35,@TappySF Let’s hope the next one even gets noticed amongst the fake hypes
36,@Loopifyyy You should be the change you wanna see.  Try find small game developers building cool shit you can promote as an example of doing things right.  I suggest @VoyagersGame but obviously biased 😂
37,"@seritap333 @VoyagersGame @MoralisWeb3 Yes I think it’s worth it.  Some of the old stuff is a little out of date but worth the practice anyway.  Def the sort of easiest way to get a basic grasp of things, but be prepared to do more work as well after on your own before you proficient."
38,@NftCelestials Hahaha they sure are
39,@NftCelestials @rarible Fire! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
40,@crispylines Nice 😎 hope you planning on minting a @VoyagersGame pass soon
41,I you building a ‘nft’ game by copying some ponzu contract on GitHub and skinning a front end you not really building a game
42,@VoyagersGame @MoralisWeb3 Feels great working on the future! 🚀
43,@108lvl gm brother :)
44,"@billgil Sure.  you guys wanna give away a pass? 

Gonna dm you on discord now."
45,https://t.co/ypwQh8sQ3y https://t.co/v7UE4Zjt1p
46,@beaniemaxi And yet small teams like us at @VoyagersGame built a playable multiplayer meta verse demo before even minting but only minted 80/2222 genesis passports so far.  …. Probably nothing

65,@DrCryptomandela @IvanOnTech @MoralisWeb3 @MoralisAcademy Try build something you think people might use. This is by far the best way to learn and force yourself to put in the hours cos of the potential earnings it might make you.

92,"gm Voyagers 🛰 

It’s a great day to code the future 🚀"
93,8/8:  One day Ivan released a video on the Aavegotchi game jam and a sort of intro vid into game design using @phaser_ game engine. That was the day I suddenly realised I most likely already had what it takes to actually build something incredible and got to work on @VoyagersGame
94,7/8:  In Auguest I started getting work for NFT contracts and later merkle tree api's so I set up @peppermintlabco with @henry0eth whom I met during a NFT deep dive to start taking on more work in the NFT space.
95,"6/8:  After bringing in over 10 BNB from this tool within the first month, and over 100 users I knew my direction would become full time web3. For the next few months I started more tutorials soaking up as much knowledge as I could get my hands on."
96,5/8:  During the first month of dedicating myself to the courses I started building my first project on Binance smart chain. It was a factory using EIP-1167: Minimal Proxy Contract that users could create interesting tokens with a simple form.
97,4/8:  In March last year I decided it was about time I really learnt solidity and so I started my journey through @IvanOnTech's courses which have now become @MoralisWeb3 Academy. . .
98,"3/8:  I spent the next few years building wordpress websites for hair salons, restaurants, gyms and the like. With any spare time I had I would research and try contribute to crypto projects I liked with UX design which often earned some coins."
99,"2/8:  I started like most self taught devs. A lot of @freeCodeCamp and a front end nano degree from @udacity set me up to start freelancing... 

... I spent more hours interviewing than actually getting any work. I'm sure fellow freelancers can relate."
