20,"Wow, I literally have to go to the airport for a cat friendly hotel. Shame on you, LA!"
21,"@chubbicorn80 I don’t know who you are either, but I like you, and thank you! 🖤🐾"
22,"Are there any f’ing hotels in LA that allow cats?! It’s pretty misleading to be “pet friendly,” yet only ADA guide dogs are allowed."
23,"@jason_metcalfe Haven’t found a place yet, but I’m gonna stay in a hotel down the street until some paperwork arrives. After that, gonna head out to some parks and roam until I find something permanent. Not sure where yet."
24,"@caturday2020 It’s definitely pricey, and I know I could get more space, more sleep (it’s so loud here), and a much safer neighborhood farther out, but I love the city, too. 🖤 I’m gonna roam for a bit, and maybe when I’m in the peace and quiet I’ll be okay, but now I’m def sad to leave."
25,"@caturday2020 Indeed. 🖤🐾 I don’t want to go. If I could stay I would, but it’s too expensive here."
26,"@wantingproject I actually haven’t found a place yet, but I’m gonna be staying down the street in a hotel for a bit while I wait for some documents/paperwork to arrive. I’m planning to head to Death Valley and some other parks until I find something more permanent, but I want to stay in DTLA. 🖤"
