7,@Jenny_Pollack @AlchemyPlatform yah i agree!
8,@Jenny_Pollack @AlchemyPlatform sort of but probably more of a purpose built meta crypto network that provides what alchemy provides.
9,@AlchemyPlatform 👀
10,alchemy dao confirmed 😅 https://t.co/gGudd6YuwM
11,"@AlchemyPlatform yah, for the most part. wen AlchemyDAO basically 😅

12,@Jenny_Pollack @AlchemyPlatform 🙃
13,"is there progress being made on a ""public goods"" version of @AlchemyPlatform?"
14,"@JKSaba44 @creatorcabins agree re: adu policies. companies like @coverbuild could be a good thing to leverage initially and then could go ""in house"" when it made sense"
15,@ldf_gm @creatorcabins @JKSaba44 🥺
16,@creatorcabins @JKSaba44 wait next week as in the week that i *also* will be spending a week there? :)
17,"ok so i’m thinking we help transform one million single family properties in california into duplex, triplex or quadplex properties enabled by the latest collection of laws that relate to zoning. that would add about 2m housing units. let’s do it in the next 3 years too. let’s go"
18,"@annxliu @opensea dang that’s so weird! let’s hope it’s a temp error on their back end. but yah, open sea is so frustrating to use overall"
19,@annxliu @opensea that’s so frustrating! did they even give you a reason why?
20,@divine_economy @xuannu_eth omg yes
21,@divine_economy @xuannu_eth fake it till you make it maybe??? OR we could like change the rules of biz and “what works” in our web3 future.
22,"ok this was a tough one to decide so i’m declaring all four of those who submitted cool places winners of an ev ga nft.

30,like i’ve literally felt so alienated for most of my decade+ tech career as 99 percent of people just couldn’t see the amazing power and means of creation they wielded. it was agonizing.
31,i’m so tired of how complacent and short sighted the majority of those in tech are. both in web2 AND web3. we were blessed with the alchemy of turning silicon and the sun into computation and we largely spend *our* energy pursuing ego centric wealth creation. it’s tragic!!
32,"i just feel so down that we live in a world where i can communicate and create with others from all over, but where there are still nation states murdering others for conquest. not just with russia but all over. why can’t we evolve beyond this. we are so close :("
33,i really wish that people in power all over the world wouldn’t resort to violence :( there’s literally enough space for all of us. we can figure things out. we DON’T need to murder each other. but it seems those facts don’t matter.
34,this is huge! congrats @radicle team 💖 https://t.co/kl2mehmmxa
35,@skoops ok
36,"web3 projects need to consider “Trust &amp; Safety” aspects of their protocols and dapps way more than they do now. it’s a hard *and* human problem that even the biggest corps can’t get right. but maybe if the incentive structures are realigned, we could with web3"
37,@AlmostMedia honestly feeling a bit paranoid rn https://t.co/62ZApH9yvF
38,@whizwang yah they can't find it lol
39,"capital one really just lost a $32k wire i sent out yesterday. rip me

41,@musingsbyrach thanks! i just figured that out about ten mins ago. now i have another 40 mins of holding to do via it :(
42,i fucking hate tradfi https://t.co/lmPsVYqDss
43,"getting rugged by tradfi for being temporarily voiceless. bank account supposedly can't talk to me when i'm using a text to speech app. has locked my account relating to me sending a legit wire n keeps telling me to call a relay service. i did, but i have no idea how to use it."
44,"@jemgold_ @damedoteth @trent_vanepps @rafathebuilder i think open sourcing contracts but not UI as a ""moat"" will go away at some point"
45,"@damedoteth @jemgold_ @trent_vanepps mirror is web 2.5 at best and i don't think they were ever trying to be web3, but they did leverage crypto native features. so i don't think they will start being open source now. maybe @rafathebuilder has more insight tho"

63,not every feature/capability needs a brand
64,"@chaserchapman @rafathebuilder @aol_xyz there needs to be a less binary, approximate token gating option where it 1) token gates by trusted/related holdings and/or allow lists 2) an option to add addresses manually"
65,"@chaserchapman @rafathebuilder token gating private comms makes sense maybe? but yah, this is something we ate exploring @aol_xyz too"
