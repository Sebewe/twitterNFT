10,@ajt @tropoFarmer looking forward to it!
11,@Loopifyyy @LoganOP_gm @NateAlexNFT give it 5 days and 14 hours
12,"@NateAlexNFT with how many new memes and events coming out daily, I would be surprised if we are talking about Kevin in 1 month"
13,@eiffel_ny sold the bottom of what though? a day or week? In one week you could of technically sold higher than where it ends up.
14,"If you chase selling the top you most likely will always be caught selling on the downtrend. When it feels right for you to sell, do it &amp; know you made your best decision at the time. What happens after is irrelevant."

16,"I still support doodles design mechanism on this, I think it’s innovative &amp; for us to move on in this space we need to keep doing just that. 

Best we can do as a community is help inform people more but ultimately in the end it’s their choice if they want to read or not."
17,"@theoneroomgroup @Loopifyyy @NateAlexNFT I flip and care about the space. Never said you can’t, what I meant is some people are JUST flipping and don’t care to really read about much."
18,@wabdoteth not being added to any group chat because the green text
19,@Loopifyyy @NateAlexNFT Truth is a lot of people who are flipping nfts don’t care about innovation or any of it so they will get burnt when not caring to read. Having passion for this space is such a plus because you genuinely want to see innovation and always reading all about it.
20,"@NateAlexNFT Yah I really like what doodles did, it’s something innovative and fun. Needs to be done in this space if we want to progress. Stuff like that will always happen when new things are created so the best we can do is just get the word out."
21,@carsonturner this man really hexed kevin
22,"@doodles This is not a hack or faulty contract, this is intended by doodles to not dilute the supply with extra nfts. Each doodle is connected to its space doodle (which I think is innovative &amp; cool) just some people dont know this &amp; are getting burnt thinking they are selling an airdrop."

24,another one just sold not knowing he sold his og doodle as well. Please share the message!! They are taking $10k+ losses right now https://t.co/onm4vHaBhH
25,This person just took a 7 eth loss because he didn’t know selling his space doodle also automatically sells his original doodle. Please be safe! https://t.co/GSAxuvMW7s

45,@Blockworks_ what are they going to do ask putin for his keys?
46,@not_katarina you just dmed me you love me wtf that was a lie?
47,@ChampagnePablo this tweet was less of buying longterm but focusing on things like creating connections or going out and building something.
48,"Also obviously if you can secure money do it, I love flipping the market as much as anyone else. But that shouldn't be the only thing you are focusing on."
49,This tweet doesn't mean holding all your nfts longterm will pay off either. There will be winners and losers but something you cant really regret is the people you met or companies you tried to create.
50,@itstylersays Trusting myself more than ever &amp; working on bringing as much quality as I can to this community. Memes are fun &amp; all but there is a ton happening behind that as well.
51,"Quick money can be made whenever in life but the connections you can create &amp; the products you can build in Web3 are at an all time high right now.

Focus on the longterm."
52,You can like something or believe in it longterm but realize the market overpriced it at the moment. This has nothing to do with the product or team but just the hype nature of this market.
53,"btw this tweet is purely speculating the market, not the product or team. I like invisible friends but the market over pumped it. Like I said before, sometimes you can like something but realize its over priced at the moment."
54,"@onlitario @Loopifyyy @InvsbleFriends I like invisible friends a lot, but yes at that price the market over pumped it (not the projects fault). I also never made fun of the art, the meme I shared was funny and doesn't hate on the art."
55,"As often as we call out bad actors in this space, it's very important to realize how many good builders there are.

Creating a project is very tough, and creating a successful one is even harder. With floor prices always moving &amp; discord 24/7 active it's a never ending job."
56,"@Loopifyyy Agree, with floor prices always moving and discord 24/7 active its a never ending job. It sucks to see some founders abuse the system to make others look bad but true people know what the real ones are building.

You are amazing Loop keep building 💪"
57,@0xQuit wayyyy deserved. Your threads are amazing
58,@NateNFT buy 3 of their past nfts
59,@jusbebetter rank 2000 something
60,wait I regret it mine revealed to this https://t.co/0QbTmRPWer
61,Selling my invisible friend for 13.4 eth pre reveal felt good at that moment and feels even better now.
62,@DiscoverXnft sold at 13.4 pre reveal lfg
63,@InvsbleFriends what about a beach zoomer hat
64,"@Loopifyyy it’s how they are approaching everything, for 70 million you think all this would be way more professional &amp; thought out.I mean just look at all their responses, saying they felt pressured to reveal &amp; even with the fud they aren’t leaving, hiding all their nfts they bought."
65,RT @jbondwagon: From this                                         To this https://t.co/J3oLJsMZnH

67,@carsonturner @tropoFarmer 🤣🤣 i’ll buy you a beer at ape fest
68,"@Legend here until Tuesday, will be moving here soon as well most likely"
69,@ldf_gm can I move in
70,@TobbyNFT is this satire? This post has nothing to do about me wanting a refund or sad my ape sold. It’s about the shadiness of what the founder did with the development money.
71,@brycent_ always down to chat!
72,@Syberer why did you send all the nfts to a separate wallet &amp; then hid them all?
73,@zrubenf1 all good! Yah I have always been against them for their shady practices https://t.co/hoXBNwxdTx

75,"The wallet that bought all the nfts then transferred it to this wallet and HID all of them from showing.

This is beyond sketchy. https://t.co/u3fzbYCeUi"
76,I'm calling PETA to get that ape out of his wallet
77,https://t.co/7BkyXpDfZz
78,Just found out the person who bought my ape was the founder of Pixelmon using the funds from the $70 million sale... He went on a buying spree of 400 eth in nfts using the products development money.
79,@DiscoverXnft 2023? I’ll take the under on that
80,"just noticed I wrote barley instead of barely, makes sense for a college dropout 🤣"
81,"From my dad committing suicide, to barley attending high school due to depression, to getting my GED in 2 months &amp; going to my dream college, to dropping out of college for nfts, &amp; now passing 40k followers from this community.

I can’t thank y’all enough, we are changing lives."

89,@TradingFemale Ill be there!
90,Hell yah I would pressure yall to reveal my nft everyone just spent $70 million for...
91,"Pixelmon just announced ""We felt pressured to push reveal and the reality is we weren't ready to push the art work.""

If they truly weren’t ready then don't do a sale for $70 million until you are confident you can deliver a product worth even half that. This is unacceptable."
92,"Really feeling this mutant, has the ""zoo"" theme going on with a rat, leopard, &amp; ape. What y’all think? https://t.co/tYas2WVjWE"
93,@ZAGABOND only if you post thirst traps

97,"@KingBlackBored 100%, love you kbb"
98,@DiscoverXnft So pumped have been having a ton of discussions with some amazing people. Going to give it my all
99,"After the floor rising on BAYC I am still content with my decision of selling my ape. I believe in BAYC more than any nft but securing profit is important mentally &amp; financially.

I can now focus more on creating &amp; supplying content. Thankful for you all, a lot to come from me 💛"
