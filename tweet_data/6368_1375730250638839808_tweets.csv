- Customised profiles and layouts for creators
- ability to search for genres or themes
- Large and high resolution display when viewing a single item"
35,@willeeNFT Great question. I don’t think it’s the features that’s the challenge. More so the way the content is presented and searchable. But if I was to list some features here’s some suggestions.

39,"🧵 @rarible I will be honest I haven’t used this much, sorry team! Although volume seems too low to be a viable option right now."
40,"🧵 @opensea offers the best all round experience for creators and collectors in the space. 

Pretty cheap to get started, great volume and pretty decent user options. 

Just a shame all that volume is on PFPs and the UI doesn’t really allow your content to stand out."
41,"🧵 Don’t even get me started in their new collections rubbish! Why should I have to create a whole collection, when I want to display 1/1 artwork!? 🤯"
42,"🧵 @withFND is a decent platform and probably the best for showing off your artwork 🖼. 

Although the architecture of the platform and with gas ⛽️ prices being so high, it’s a high barrier to entry for most. So many are priced out of the market."
43,"🧵 Whoever can crack this, in my option will be the winner in this space! 🚀🔥
