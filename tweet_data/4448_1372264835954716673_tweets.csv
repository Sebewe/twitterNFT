26,11/ ARF ARF SAPPY SEALS SAPPY SEALS
27,"10/ The rules of the game:
1. Be patient. No FOMO (the next great deal is right around the corner)
2. Don't be slow - contradicts with 1. but when you get a good price you MUST take action
3. Never, ever overpay. Recalculate everything and underpay (it's always possible)"
28,9/ Stalk the seller. Find his Twitter/Discord/Website anything. Check his wallet for ENS names he owns - maybe that is his nickname. Check wallet activity. If you manage to find him you DM him and start negotiating. For negotiating the right way just use Google and study.
29,8/ Load your guns. Open rarity tools in one tab and OpenSea Sappy Seals activity in another. Click on the listings filter!!! Now you are one of the first people to see that underpriced rare Arfer listed. You can shoot a low WETH offer or...
30,7/ Now with all that knowledge it's time to work. Flip most of your ETH into WETH (it's costs almost no gas). his way you can try doing lower-than-rarity-floor offers but higher-than-bots'-offers offers. Using this I managed to save up around 0.6-0.7 ETH.
31,"6/ Be mindful of the current market's psychology. A war started on Thursday, so many people are looking for liquidity. This is a great chance to close deals. Look at how often and how big WETH offers are being accepted, instead of normal buys. Be patient, wait for such a moment"
32,"5/ Then (or in conjunction with the last step) you open https://t.co/n3wVZbrUVj and you start looking at the floor prices for Uncommon Seals, Rare ones, etc. This way you know what a good price is and what offers can you later send. You will be using this with every purchase."
33,"4/ Continue with following the market for a few days. Start studying the traits - VR sets are very rare for example, while black durags are relatively common. Knowing the trait ranks will shave off seconds/minutes off of your sniping which sometimes make a difference."
34,"3/ Next thing is you have to study the rarity based staking emissions, like hard. Base seal (4001 - 10000 rank) - 50 $PIXL a day, Uncommon (2001 - 4000 rank) 60 $PIXL a day, Rare (501 - 2000 rank) - 75 $PIXL a day, etc. You shouldn't need to check them, ever."
35,"2/ First of all check the floor, then make a realistic, but challenging goal of how much $PIXL a day you want your Seals to farm. In my case the floor was 1 ETH and my budget was 9 ETH so my goal was to get to over 500 $PIXL a day."
36,"1/ For the last 5 days I have been sniping Seals. I spent 9.05 ETH to buy 9 Arfers that make me ~550 $PIXL a day (currently ~45$ a day). I managed to close some pretty nice deals so I decided to share with you my know-how on:
Sniping @SappySealsNFT  - the Smart way🧵"
37,OK i'm doing it. Stay tuned.

60,@GoodFriendRick @fplandbooze Check how much PIXL a Seal earns when staked and do quick math in your brain to do an offer based on the floor. This is the simplest way

82,@deeberiroz This particular one is minor imo.
83,"@deeberiroz Ok, you are right. This is a flaw I guess, setting rarity should be limited to the size of the rewardRate array - 1. But still a minor issue I think"
