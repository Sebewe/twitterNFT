10,Congratulations to our close friends at @Mawsoninc for their new agreement with @CelsiusNetwork.
11,@CryptoBock @ChristiesInc @psychedelic_nft @worldofwomennft @Benblenner This looks epic. I love @worldofwomennft. Minted and still hold 3 or 4!
12,"We knew that this mechanic might take 2-4 months to catch on, but it seems like a few people are joining via a pass and that’s awesome to see. No matter what NFT you own of ours, we’re all here building together. ✌🏻"
13,"Adding passes into the ecosystem didn’t make sense to a lot of people when we went to mint. But now that the genesis membership is US$10,000 each, a pass for US$851 is a great entry point for people to get their toes wet in our #PAverse ecosystem."
14,@GANYMEDEnft @psychedelic_nft That’s the point
15,More people are buying @psychedelic_nft ‘Passes’ to join the #PAverse instead of having to fork out 3.5-3.7e for a genesis. Great to see.
16,@Silv_1461 @psychedelic_nft Split among many!
17,"Also we won’t be signing any NDA’s, ideas are useless unless you execute on them and we don’t have overflow resources to ‘steal’ your ideas and do them. All information will be treated as strictly confidential and thi will be confined on the application portal."

21,"@erhorner @JTNTTX @Twitter @psychedelic_nft I respect your opinion, but how I keep my NFTs worth hundreds of ETH safe is my choice, and connecting my wallet to Twitter is something I’ve decided not to do based on my asset / risk tolerance. If you think it’s about ‘3 bucks a month’ then you’re kidding yourself."

26,"If the general consensus is that I should apply, I will! Who knows if I’ll even get it anyway 🤷🏻‍♂️"
27,"Further to that, if you don’t notice the wrong username, the small follower count and common sense of me not asking to ‘DM me’ then I’m not quite sure how much the little blue tick will help that person if they can’t notice the above. Either way, I’ll think about it today ✌🏻"
28,"I understand the impersonator point, but most people know at this stage I’m never going to ask them to ‘send me a DM’ and normally these accounts have small follower counts and the wrong username. I can see maybe 2-5% of people talking to them, and then figuring out it’s not me."
29,"Honestly I haven’t submitted for @Twitter verification because it seems 70-80% of verified accounts are comment liking bots, scammers or looking to exploit an audience? Feels weird tbh"
30,A celebrity promoting an #NFT project with little to no previous web3 affiliation is one of the biggest 🚩’s ever.

57,IMPORTANT: What would you want to ask an expert about in regards to #Psychedelics ? We’ll do our best to answer all your questions next week! 👇🏼👇🏼
58,Find experts who you can delegate to and scale with on tasks you have no experience with.
59,A founder who tries to do everything himself or herself will ultimately fail.
60,@markanton92 @psychedelic_nft @blader @PauliePullz I love that zipper
61,@markanton92 @psychedelic_nft @blader @PauliePullz Incredible pickup.
62,"Just an FYI: this was not aimed any anyone in particular or from any community, it has been a general observation of the space over the last 2-3 months. No one is in ‘trouble’ or should be, it’s just part of this space growing up, maturing and learning together as a collective."
63,"There is always an exception to the rule, and in this case if you’re just messing around and sh*tposting with a few of your friends then it obviously doesn’t matter. But seriously @ ing people and asking / pressuring them, is not the play."
64,"It’s honestly common sense.  Asking / pressuring people to do things is not the way. Be nice, be thankful for when people have strong conviction and do not shame people based on their decisions (buying or selling) during any time. Web3 is better than that."
65,PRO TIP: Asking a whale or someone specific to ‘buy your NFT for XETH’ or ‘sweep the floor’ has a 95% chance of making them NOT want to sweep the floor and will also likely result in them avoiding the project entirely. Do what you will with this info.

68,"#NFTs are great, but there are bigger things happening in the world. 

Use these events as perspective.

What people in Ukraine will experience over the coming weeks and months will be horrendous.

Geopolitical uncertainty is at an all time high, and will be for a while."
69,My thoughts are with everyone currently living in or around Ukraine.

76,The 27th will represent a new phase of the #PAverse as we merge the digital and physical.
77,What comes next will push us past being just a ‘digital’ brand.
78,NFTs are simply just the beginning of the #PAverse ecosystem.
79,"We will never do a ‘stealth drop’ or ‘stealth mint’ we will never ‘surprise you’ when it comes to spending ETH on something. If it seems suspicious, it is.

We will always confirm any activity / news on Twitter as well as Discord.
