5,@CRYPTOCHRIS24 @zapper_fi That’s a secret I’m sorry 🤫 . There’s a rumour holders will get a huuuuuge airdrop.

11,"We wrote a little Slack bot that uses our indexed NFT data to return the most traded collections over a period of time. We even have wash trading filtering! 

Just a little preview of all the cool things we'll be able to do in @zapper_fi with our new data. https://t.co/JBpzki9cw1"
12,@bubby_io @zapper_fi @DeBankDeFi Yes and we want to empower our users to build integrations the way they want for their protocols 😇
13,"@bubby_io @zapper_fi @DeBankDeFi It’s a tough problem, but we have a solid team and a good plan."
14,"@bubby_io @zapper_fi @DeBankDeFi 2/2 We had something close to ship a few weeks ago but decided it wasn’t good enough. We need to nail this thing. See it as a temporary slow down for exponential growth once we ship. We’re aiming for greatness in the long run, same for NFTs."
15,@bubby_io @zapper_fi @DeBankDeFi 1/2 We are working on this problem. Racing to implement protocols is not a sustainable nor desirable approach in the long run. DeFi growth is exponential. Therefore we’re working on a way for the community to easily integrate their protocols with Zapper.

22,@freelandies @zapper_fi BigQuery is one of the tools we use among others. It's used to perform data analysis on very large datasets.
23,Our real-time NFT ingestion mechanism via pub/sub is now working 🚀. We also sync our relational database in BigQuery to perform complex aggregations on it. We'll start using this data in @zapper_fi very soon 🤞
24,@NBAtrollsDOTcom @zapper_fi @Cheesecake Ahh so you're the one slowing down our servers.. I see...
25,"@0x_marc @heals_mark @zapper_fi Yep! We currently rely on OpenSea for this data but we built our own NFT indexer to compute that on our own, alongside rarity scores etc. The indexer is mostly finished and working great, we now need to integrate it! You should see a bunch of improvements landing in a few weeks."

38,@tomuky @zapper_fi Haha trust me it is. I had goosebumps when I checked my balances the first time and saw that everything was  accurate. We also store all the sales history. We currently only support OpenSea as a marketplace but will add more strategies eventually.

44,"The devs at @zapper_fi just finished indexing all the NFT transfers and OpenSea sales since block 0 on mainnet.

That's:

- ~25 million NFT transfers
- ~12 billions in sales on OpenSea

45,@Leboxer2 @sebaudet26 The plan is to have NFT support for multiple chains yes. We are starting with Ethereum mainnet but will iterate from there.

55,Super stoked that @maxime__bedard joined @zapper_fi on Monday. Maxime is a very talented production engineer coming from @Shopify I have had the pleasure to work with in the past. It's one of those hires you know will be a game changer. Happy to have you on board Max!
56,@benfromdallas @bubby_io Some people could use this false narrative to discredit Ethereum after the Merge. I think it's important for everyone to understand that PoS does not directly correlate with lower gas fees.
57,"📣 The Merge, or transition of #Ethereum to Proof of Stake, is NOT meant to and will NOT visibly reduce gas fees. This is a false narrative. L2s and sharding are the solutions to the gas issue, not PoS."
58,@tornadobro11 @zapper_fi We love you too ♥️

81,RT @AgamemnonEth: bullish on @zapper_fi in 2022
82,"@raise_exception @zapper_fi Next up, we will get rid of the brute-force approach on the backend to know what apps the user has interacted with by compiling a view of holdings for every user via ETLs built from blockchain events."
83,@raise_exception @zapper_fi The client used to fetch these supported apps with a first roundtrip and then balances via multiple HTTP/2 requests. But with streaming we perform a single call. This eliminates the necessity for this initial network roundtrip.
84,"@raise_exception @zapper_fi Indeed, on a first load Zapper will brute-force balances for all applications, but then it caches the set of apps used by the user in the backend. This cache needs to be in the backend so it can be invalidated if the user performs a transaction on-chain."
85,@maonini_ @InnerFire11 @Deadfellaznft 👀
86,@alexsnaps @jonhoo Ohhh need to get that one.
87,@voogarix @zapper_fi We're on it
88,"@cory_eth @zapper_fi We are not using websockets but ""server-sent events"" over http which is a form of streaming. Every X seconds the client requests balances with a single request and the server streams them as they get computed. Once all the balances are returned the connection is closed."
89,@chrishobcroft @latetot @zapper_fi We shipped the change yesterday but optimized even more today.
90,@KryptoSimoon @zapper_fi https://t.co/PzFRp3mCNP
91,@0x_hiatus @zapper_fi It's in our pipeline!
92,@0x_Osprey @zapper_fi It's hard to give a precise number without accurate client side instrumentation. Comparing backend metrics would be comparing apples and oranges. But cache hits are almost instant now and cache misses are at least 2x faster.. I guess? 😄
93,@0x_Osprey @zapper_fi We eliminated a network roundtrip that was required before fetching balances. So that's a ~200ms shaved off. We also got rid of request queueing in the browser and there's overall less client overhead.
94,"Have you noticed @zapper_fi got faster?

We changed the way we fetch balances and now use streaming instead of parallelizing HTTP/2 requests. 

That's just the beginning though 😏. We have other huge improvements coming soon."
