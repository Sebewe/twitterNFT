13,"Just registered a couple triple digit ENS domains. I think this will be the first domain category with a clear floor price once all of them are taken (currently 352/1000 left). A floor price is important because it provides liquidity, which domains lack contrary to other nfts."

27,How many ENS domains do you own?
28,@serplease69 @EnsSales Crazy thing is that even 1 of these domains could sell for 450 ETH in the long run
29,@tradens Almost all of these are steals
30,Guess both of those are sold now too..
31,@3LAU Web 3 identities.
32,Almost all of these have been sold since I tweeted this (most of them a lot lower than listing price). Everyone who bought domains from this guy will make bank. Still left are whale.eth (30 eth) and hodl.eth (15 eth). https://t.co/zWciWz8cm5

61,"@DegenNFTs True, but would be better if these kind of domains were hidden by default."
62,@soy_eth Its a matter of time
63,Careful what u place your bids on. This guy accidently put a 15 WETH offer on a fake defi.eth domain (with non-ASCII characters) and a bot instantly bought for the 0.2 ETH it was listed for and accepted the 15 ETH offer. He had no time to cancel. Very sad to see this. https://t.co/6IzwGKw3f8

68,@metaimmutable They are not mine sadly
69,Looks like 2 of these are already bought now.
70,Anyone looking for some relatively cheap highly premium names should have a look here. I mean dollar.eth for just 10 eth is an absolute steal. https://t.co/MUoZqFMCt6

76,@EnsSales You would think this one would go for a bit more.
77,@crypto_moha @EnsSales He would have been better off holding the 100 eth then no?
78,@EnsSales This one was bought for 100 eth and now sold for 33. Not the best deal.
79,@sadaf_eth wut
80,@damedoteth Come on one persons views can't represent a whole community of almost 300k people that almost all disagree. You having a .eth name does not mean you associate yourself with brantley or his views. This is ridiculous.

86,@ensregistry Lmao
87,@CryptoDabi @12yrold_with_cc @BrantlyMillegan Yes because in modern society most christians/yews do not take it that seriously. All Im saying is that if they did society would look very different. The danger with religion is that people can see a source of information as absolute truth because it is Gods word.
88,@CryptoDabi @12yrold_with_cc @BrantlyMillegan Yea if you leave the whole old testament out its not that bad
89,@12yrold_with_cc @BrantlyMillegan Its not Catholicism its the bible. If people who believe its the word of God would take it seriously they would believe things like homosexuality being evil.
