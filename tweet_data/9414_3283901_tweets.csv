45,"So why Alta?

The Alta VR team is building ""A Township Tale"" - an open world VR RPG set in a medieval setting. You chop down trees, craft, fight, hang out with other people, and much more

51,"I also think video is the right format, particularly live video. The special thing about hearing a founder talk about their startup is that you can hear their excitement, their energy - and video can capture that. Slide decks are okay, but not enough

Stonks is all about video!"

- The future of startups will be global
