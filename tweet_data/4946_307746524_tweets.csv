9,"@dougdagnabbit It sounds like they're using ""ambassadors"" to promote the company for ""free"" then when this person wins without clicks.. they removed them 

That's even worse.."
10,"@dougdagnabbit It's one thing to deny a partnership based on metrics, but a giveaway 💀💀💀"

33,@CjaImighty Same 😂😂😂
34,@VioTCZ No food was lost though
35,@LoochyTV If you're looking for a real answer? It's most likely a trashcan marketing agency manages his account with follow for follow tactics just to boost metrics.

The gyro setup seems complex enough most wouldn't have thought of it. Let alone figured it out. Maybe, I'm wrong here."

68,"@Camgaroooo @rivaLxfactor Yeah.. let's ignore the most popular trend / fps titles for the last 5+ years without adapting.. then give our player base the same game, we've been giving them for years.

What could go wrong."
69,"@rivaLxfactor It was doomed from the start, it's just an updated game with similar game-modes to previous titles.

Not to mention they completely ignored the BR genre, but oh look we have tornados! https://t.co/lgqIYYzvO2"

82,"@RUM0R5 @kiiril @sweetanita This is why I mentioned varies on factors like location (my state has different limits) that video is super helpful! 

You can still call billing and negotiate a cash price which will drop thousands / hundreds off the price."
83,@Savage_2C Please no
84,"@LoochyTV If you're playing passive it's not awful, but that's the idea they're going for imo."
85,"@kiiril @sweetanita Depending on where you live, you can generally negotiate with the Hospital for reduced costs and sometimes have it completely forgiven. Some locations have similar funds entirely for this purpose.

It's going to vary on a lot of factors, but always worth looking into."
86,@FishStix sooo can you partner me or what? 💀
87,"@TheAnonimGamer @sweetanita I recently moved at that time and didn't have a primary care physician, I had to have an evaluation from a psychiatrist.

90,"@sweetanita This is fucking incredible.

Not too long ago, I had to get re-diagnosed for ADHD. Simple enough? It was not covered via insurance. Thankfully, I'm in a position to afford it. (~$2,500) 

It's disgusting how expensive mental health is to treat, this fund is awesome. 🙂"
