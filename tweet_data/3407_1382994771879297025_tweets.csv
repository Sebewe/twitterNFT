44,"Finally hopped on board and scooped an NWO by @iwonn_official.

In my opinion this is one of the most underrated, undervalued, and under-seen collections in the #NFT space.

Yes, I made up ""under-seen"", but probably nothing...👀

94,"🚀Reasons I'm BULLISH on @CryptoMories 🚀

✅ Community involvement - Community has say in future evolution of Mories

95,"🚨Reasons I'm BULLISH on @pixelbeastsnft 🚨

✅Founder, Yohei Nakajima works in #VC, so used to maximizing returns

✅PixelBeasts will be used as a platform to test innovations that come across the VC desk

✅Already began open-source prototypes of cross-#NFT utility tools https://t.co/BUI3yymW3P"
