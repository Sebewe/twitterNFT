14,"Without them putting themselves on the line to experiment, the music industry would not progress except in the exact ways it has been done before. They bear the weight of not only being an artist, but also a structural pioneer."
15,I'm so disappointed to see music artists building here get attacked - especially ones that have been steadily building in their own lane and pioneering for other artists for more than a decade.
16,"The fact that music artists in the NFT space are thinking beyond just Spotify streams, concert tickets and merch is incredible for the future of music and music artists everywhere. They are breaking the current confines of how artists currently get paid (or don't)."

19,@Gee__Gazza @Nate_Rivers @karsendaily this is just a rando woman’s perspective on BAYC when I first saw that utility 🤷🏻‍♀️ I support anyone who is in it
20,@Gee__Gazza @Nate_Rivers @karsendaily oh I know! just very dude humor to be frank
21,"If fans will spend thousands, if not millions of dollars, on a signed autograph or a worn piece of clothing from a favorite celeb, who are we to judge those that want to spend their own money to support their favorite artists? Who determines that worth?"
22,"Web3 cannot become a space where we are putting artists up in the line of fire - continually asking them: wen utility, wen utility? Artists have had it hard enough. The music and art industries have already put them through a circus continually separating them from their value"
23,"I thought web3 was putting more worth and value into the hands of artists, but what I'm hearing is that fans want more and more utility and value out of *the artists* than they ever had access to in web2"
24,What determines the value of art? What drew me to the NFT space was that artists of all kinds could determine their own worth and build fan communities on their own accord that want to directly support that. They get to be in charge of continually adding value to their art or not
