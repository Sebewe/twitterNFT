3,@Level_5_Firooz @BossBeautiesNFT Thank you!
4,"I love how @EyesoFashionNFT is pushing us to think about how we present ourselves in web3 beyond just our PFP. Fashion and style will be a big part of our web3 identity, so I can't miss this, Minting in 10 minutes!

Also love @TaliaZoref's work! https://t.co/XuAbrIXbQ0"
5,"RT @BossBeautiesNFT: We are proud to announce that Boss Beauties will be the first NFTs ever to be on display at the United Nations.

7,"Always celebrate the small wins as they are on the path to the big wins.

Congrats on 2500! @ExpansionPunks https://t.co/ehQ0HChvdB"
8,If you were thinking of minting @ExpansionPunks you better do so quickly! Minting could sell out before the end of the night. https://t.co/QamnqbFC6r
9,@awhueth @CryptoPhunksV2 @ExpansionPunks I don't know and that's more of a question for the team or an IP expert. As an individual who's only using it for fun then it certainly falls under free use.
10,"@CryptoPhunksV2 @ExpansionPunks @posvar While I can't say if xpunks are a good investment, I do like supporting projects with ethos I align with. Minting is still open at https://t.co/LQcPKum6q7 or you can take a look at the secondary market on OpenSea and grab a piece as low as .04eth. 10/10"
11,@CryptoPhunksV2 @ExpansionPunks @posvar Web3 is constantly evolving. Part of that evolution is taking what exists in the past and building on it. I love that xpunks are building on top of such an important og project while keeping the spirit of the original alive. 9/10
12,"@CryptoPhunksV2 @ExpansionPunks @posvar “females couldn't have hoodies or cowboy hats - they couldn't even smile"" https://t.co/dZuxu9dpea 8/10"
13,"@CryptoPhunksV2 @ExpansionPunks @posvar ""My 3 daughters were intrigued seeing me spending so much time staring at all these pixel characters, and wanted to jump in and find their own Punks. We learned through that exercise that there were a lot of disparities in the original collection …” 7/10"
14,"@CryptoPhunksV2 @ExpansionPunks 3) xpunks were created with a goal of fixing the imbalances found in the original collection. @posvar recently gave this explanation in discord: ""The xPunks came into being while I was researching the purchase of my original CryptoPunk #7741. ..."" 6/10"
15,@CryptoPhunksV2 @ExpansionPunks 2) xpunks are numbered 10000 to 19999 to explicitly show that they are not punks but an expansion of the originals. 5/10
16,@CryptoPhunksV2 @ExpansionPunks 1) xpunks are completely distinct from the original punks. The team spent significant time making sure the generative algorithm created new pieces. 4/10
17,"@CryptoPhunksV2 @expansionpunks purpose is not as a substitute for the original punks, but as a way to extend the collection to add new aesthetics and expression. They've done this through multiple ways: 3/10"
18,@CryptoPhunksV2 Think about some of your favorite games of all time. Many of them had expansions and those expansions only enriched the original work. Would League of Legends be as popular as it is without adding new heros? Did Zelda Breath of the Wild damage the legacy of Ocarina of Time? 2/10
19,"Have you wanted to join the punk universe but never could afford it?

With so much drama happening between punks and @CryptoPhunksV2 recently, I started researching the alternative punk universe. That's where I found this gem that embodies web3. 🧵 1/?"
20,"Flower Girls is a new project with charity as a key focus.
Minting just went live and loving the community so far! https://t.co/O500cNLjwA"
21,"Wow! Honored to be displayed at the @NYSE! I also see @GFOviedo @_tayericks @lkshrtmnn 👋

26,It doesn't necessarily matter who I am. It only matters who we are and what we accomplish together.
