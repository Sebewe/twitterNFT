1,@ReginaldLiger @xethorn @ndahlberg Heck I remember impromptu going from Kendall to the grove for a party cuz it only took 20 min…
2,@xethorn @ReginaldLiger @ndahlberg Ya know it’s kinda nuts how 10 years ago I used to barely look at traffic before going somewhere. Now I won’t take meetings that require going somewhere during rush hour.
