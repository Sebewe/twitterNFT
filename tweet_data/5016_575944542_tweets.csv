$100k invested years 5 – 11
$200k invested years 12 – 18

lifetime multiplier = 256
expected lifetime net worth = $56.3M

btw over $30M accumulates from the first four years of investments (check yourself)"
40,"expected lifetime net worth:

current investments X lifetime multiplier (LM)

plus

expected investments over the next 4 years X LM

plus

expected investments from years 5 to 11 X (LM / two)

43,"extreme example: you could be leaving $1,000 on the table for $1 wasted

now you have to decide where on this curve provides the optimal value for you and your family

being an extreme spender/saver isn't optimal https://t.co/7gSMXfPpr6"

@The_OpenDAO 

https://t.co/nYsFKoKbJW"
69,"it's an interesting and new project that just minted this past week though

it's different than any project I've seen

this time it's backed by real assets in the treasury which adds an additional layer of value to the community

these jpegs are pretty neat https://t.co/lB3mgFHQbS"
70,"there are some of the risks I'll be monitoring:

-leadership of the DAO

-balancing high volume, strong community, and value to holders

-involvement of creative team once DAO leadership takes over

-regulatory uncertainty about ability to return value to holders"
71,"it will be interesting to see how the staking system is implemented while also incentivizing high volume of transactions (in order to keep the treasury growing from royalties)

definitely an innovative and new approach to a community"
72,"@ChubbyKaijuDAO is working on implementing a staking system for NFTs to distribute ""labor""

there's currently some regulatory constraints/uncertainty about distributing revenue directly to kaiju holders

but as time goes on that should be cleared up"
73,"it's essentially a representative democracy

and since it's still developing and iterating, it'll be interesting to see what the structure looks like a few months from now

basically a political science case study"
74,"the governance structure is also very interesting for @ChubbyKaijuDAO 

each kaiju is from one of three countries

each country elects a representative periodically (every few weeks — TBD on DAO voting)

the three representatives will vote on behalf of the DAO"
75,"so to sum up the economics of @ChubbyKaijuDAO treasury, there are two ways it can increase in value: 

royalties from all trades

increase in treasury investments through $SOS or other future allocations voted on by the DAO"
76,"the $SOS token was distributed via airdrop up until 12 January

the token is essentially a bet on the NFT ecosystem and allows for more efficient growth in the space

~8% of the airdrop went unclaimed and was moved to the treasury after @The_OpenDAO voting https://t.co/R19BKAD2Fn"
77,"the entire initial 180 ETH — 100 ETH from mint and 1.6k in volume — is to be placed in SOS (then staked through OpenDAO)

so owning a kaiju is additional leverage into the OpenDAO ecosystem

that means @The_OpenDAO  tokenomics are important for the viability of @ChubbyKaijuDAO https://t.co/hpcJsF3AiJ"
78,"the DAO treasury currently sits at ~180 ETH, which breaks down to .018 ETH per holder

as time goes on, 5% of every transaction is placed in the DAO treasury"
79,"the new structure by @ChubbyKaijuDAO is novel and super interesting👀

the project doubles as a DAO and 5% of the royalties are placed in the DAOs treasury

an interesting and innovative way to return value 

there's more than meets the eye with these little guys https://t.co/1uzryQkp4a"

92,"that's why NFTs are the way of the future and digital wallets will become commonplace over the next decade

just like the iPhone in 2007

no better time to learn and be involved than now🤙"
93,"and that's great for the digital economy

it's good for optionality — allowing consumers to decide between options providing different levels of value

it's good for exclusivity — allowing producers to provide digital experiences that are limited to those who have redeemed"
94,"NFTs enable that to occur in a digital space

someone can purchase and own an asset, like a ticket, which enables them to receive an exclusive experience

if it's worth it for someone to pay more for what they perceive to be a better experience, now they can do so"
95,"this is actually a good thing — all of those box seats and suites are helping the price of the normal seats to be more affordable

if there were no suites, all of those wealthy people with capital to burn could easily price you out of the market for your favorite team"
96,"later in the game you look up, and you see Jerry Jones up in his suite with a waitress bringing him a cold beer

must be nice

these are examples of optionality and exclusivity

there are multiple options, which are exclusive to whomever has redeemed/paid for them"
97,"for example: you go to a football game, tailgate with the crew beforehand, and then grab your seats just as the game is starting

you're going wild, having a good time and you're just thankful that there's a jumbotron so you can see what's going on way down on the field"
98,"NFTs have the ability to provide exclusivity to the digital marketplace the same way there is exclusivity in the physical marketplace

this is a critical step for the development of digital economies"
99,"in a robust economy with tremendous selection, consumers could get just the right amount of good X and then take their surplus to buy good Y

but what if they are willing to pay extra for a better version of good X, that's where NFTs come in"
