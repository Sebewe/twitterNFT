3,@snoobdu @psychedelic_nft That’s a W
4,@sabhyac26 No way 🤣
5,Tell me how you got into #NFTs and #Crypto!🧐⤵️
6,Projects that start with a low floor and build over time are the ones that make it. It’s hard to come hot out of the gates with like a 10eth floor. Almost always you will fall.
7,@NFTpfpPurchaser @Gitster14 I have lots of screenshots to look at...
8,@pizza_crusher Yes! Thank you for asking! ❤️
9,Ovi never leaves my side 🥰 https://t.co/sz2hP1WG4B
10,You want to create a blue chip? It’s simple. Be different. WORK HARD. DO NOT SKIP STEPS.

12,It’s crazy that it’s March already. The first 2 months have felt like a year. YOU ARE EARLY.
13,@Brandon09315330 That’s the right attitude

31,Can’t wait for manifest Monday. So many thoughts came to my mind this weekend. Time to put pen to paper.✍️
32,"@BAYC2745 @Twitter Might be best to apply, to help remove impersonating."
33,"If you are a true believer in @psychedelic_nft you should be thrilled with the slow organic growth. As a community I feel we have never been over inflated, perhaps slightly under.🚀 #PAFollowPA"
34,🚩 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 https://t.co/pKaJidJjRH
35,Most of us joined the #NFTCommunity for the money and stayed for the awesome community. Real friendships are being built!😌
36,My artists have done so many iterations.  It’s great having cousins working together to achieve greatness.😊
37,Gm everyone! I hope everyone has an awesome Sunday!🌞
38,"Gn, don’t scroll by without engaging 😴😴"

40,"@WonderTheBeast Ovi is 😴. I’m relaxing, it’s Saturday!"
41,"Man, this pixelmon stuff is a sick joke. How can you possibly release that and be okay with it. 😂"
42,Gm gm gm☕️ Happy Saturday!!!

44,I’m bullish on those who are bullish 🤷‍♂️
45,Do these rug pulling influencers not realize that they can make more money if they stick with one project? I guess they just want a quick buck with zero work. Some people never change. Stop investing in hype rug pulls.
46,"@tweetdeez757 Gm junior, what timing"
47,"Gm ☕️

Happy 26th Birthday to my better half @Ashl3yNFT! 🎉 🎂 🎈 

I hope everyone has an awesome Friday!😊"

52,"FYI, your jokes about floors and eth being low because of a war is pretty disturbing to see. This is real life. Lives are being taken. Prayers are with Ukraine. 🇺🇦 🙏❤️"

59,"Seriously, @psychedelic_nft community is built different. The love and support from the community is insane! #PAFollowPA"
60,Way over mint***
61,Just because it sells out and is selling for way over floor doesn’t mean the mint price wasn’t too high? This is the issue with NFTs right now. Hype is what is selling projects and not the actual utility they plan on doing. https://t.co/W32eHfwMLr
62,How to degen: https://t.co/TEuikYU0AW
63,@ncass12 🤣 not a chance
64,@ncass12 This sounds smart
65,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are watching FOMO first hand right now. 

*ps, blue chips might be on sale right now*"
66,@virginfty https://t.co/t4ehS5WjK1
67,Full transparency. You won’t see a project from me in the next month. I’m a bit of a perfectionist.🤭
68,Smart investors we are. https://t.co/XvjcMwtSQC
69,Am I the only one who thinks the Golden Invisible friend is ugly? So many of the other sneak peeks look better?
70,If you are a believer in @psychedelic_nft. You must look at this project as a company and not simply a NFT project. Slow and steady organic growth is normal!🚀
71,@SmrtAlecNFT Ovi taking notes daily.
72,@nfTWoo__ goldendoodle!
73,"Ovi sleeps under my desk while I work 😌🐶

*Don’t mind the messy cables 🤦‍♂️* https://t.co/ip2USg3FbA"

79,@TDKimber Lots of opportunities are coming I’m sure!
80,It still blows my mind that I joined the NFT space in September… it’s been a grind spending countless hours learning the do’s and don’ts. Soon I’ll be ready to take over. 🤫
81,I was waiting a bit before tweeting. I officially think this is my favourite mutant yet. The colours and the way it’s put together is such a vibe.✌️ #MAYC #BAYC https://t.co/YbDLuo1MBr
82,Anyone else ever call places to see if they are opened? Only to have them answer the phone so you know your answer without even asking.
83,The train is still at the station. You are early. We haven’t left yet. https://t.co/QNoeNhM7XK

88,Do me a favour. Stop tagging whales to sweep floors when a certain floor dips. Massive turn off.
89,Common sense will save you in web3. If it’s too good to be true chances are it is.
90,@BAYC2745 Is the job ever finished? The answer is NO!
91,@NudeYogaGirl Bullish on people who align themselves with like minded individuals 👌
92,"Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?"
93,Gm☕️ did you know today is 2/2/22?
94,Gn everyone 😴 Ovi is doing much better. He managed to keep some food and water down!😌
95,@Laylafromtexas @funclesnft 👀
96,"Well, today was very exciting. I became an UNCLE! 🎉"
97,Thank you for all the kind messages. He has barely moved all day. Only took one sip of water and then puked right away. Waiting to hear back from the emergency vet now.
98,Poor Ovi has to go to the vet 😢. He hasn’t eaten or drank anything all day without puking. https://t.co/RPk0StyQ1r
