6,@FFMfers @sartoshi_nft but yeah 🤝 we all mfers at end of the day - just giving a lil feedback
7,@FFMfers @sartoshi_nft okay wel that’s just unfortunate i guess - not callin u a scam or anything like that at all - just pointing out that I might b more interested if it was something i hadn’t seen before fwiw 🤷‍♂️
8,@FFMfers @sartoshi_nft i mean not to be rude couldn’t u have at least come up with something original for ur deriv project?
9,@FFMfers @sartoshi_nft that’s cool - what abt the ff mfers we already hav had for a quite a while tho? I’m confused
10,@FFMfers @CryptoLeeloo ya i honestly think that’s better
11,@MLeeJr @unofficialmfers 👏 awesome

18,@G00NR @MferRocks @justnothermfer pay attention any of u out there looking for an idea for a cash grab on a deriv project - this is some alpha 👀 (and we won’t even give u a hard time for stealing our amazing idea - DO IT! 😛)

37,@marto_gm 😵😵
38,"@breezy_996 even if it not ill-intentioned or anything, 10k is just way to big a supply for something like this at this time..."
39,@kevimlee lemme know if u lookin for a proof-reader or anything like that - i know u a smart mfer and it'll b good shit...
40,@FrankieDTankie @kevimlee @sartoshi_nft 😂
41,@kevimlee do it
42,@mfer1668 @kevimlee shits v frothy rn for sure - we just need to keep doin tha thang and itll all play out
43,@mfer1668 @kevimlee !vibe
44,@kevimlee @mfer1668 and keep buildin cool shit - i think we are primed to step it up in that area here in the next little while - still some very talented og mfers in here and we should just keep building cool shit
45,@kevimlee @mfer1668 in the meantime IMO we ought to just keep screwin around n bein funny and chill like mfers do - remember when we were below .1 all that time and just chillin n goofin off bein funny? same should be the case these days cuz we already hav learned its our superpower
46,"@kevimlee @mfer1668 i think they have to get into nfts first for a little while and hav some mediocre or shitty experiences and then mfers will b there and then for many it will b like oh fuk i get it this is the answer i want it - so, it will come in waves as new ppl come into the scene etc &amp;"
47,@KingChads we like it baaad mfer
48,@TheMetaSail @HuustleX @mfercribs for sure - my intention was only of clarification; i agree with you
49,@tw1tte7 🤔
50,"@HuustleX @TheMetaSail @mfercribs it's not always a for sure indicator of something off, necessarily, but it certainly is a reasonable cause for suspicion"
51,@TheMetaSail @HuustleX @mfercribs agreed
52,"@HuustleX @mfercribs i was there from .069 - ya def ppl with alot of influence came in and hyped us and thats alot of HOW it happened, but it was cause folks like that started to recognize what we were up to and they enjoyed it - and wut were up to was straight jokin around and makin fun shit"
53,"@HuustleX @mfercribs mfers was the anti-hype, cut out tha bullshit, fun n games, memes pfp &amp;that's why we were successful- that's a powerful ethos as we have proven n it's still the same vibe i look for today, not these 'u better buy in before its too late or b a sucker' type of tactics"
54,"@HuustleX @mfercribs sure, and hope so - i just dont dig all this fomo/hype talk i think it makes u look sus, just build and advertise ur project and let it roll no need to b pullin tha tricks, mfer"
55,@Degentraland cuz its kinda rainin on our nft party lol
56,@cryptochungus_ ciggy or no?
57,@mfercribs be the tortoise not the hare
58,"@mfercribs im sorry im not trying to give yall a hard time or ""fud"" but this just isnt the way...."
59,"@mfercribs ugh 99% of projects (even rly good ones that end up succeeding) dip after reveal - why you guys building anticipation for it to go otherwise? speaking just pragmatically, that is more likely than not to back-fire, but worse, it makes me question ur intentions and conviction in it"
60,some of the high quality 1/1 collections will really hold up for the same reasons imo
61,@cryptochungus_ @cryptonattyk lol yes that’s basically all I’m sayin i guess haha
62,@cryptonattyk i think a lot of the smaller (largely nongenerative…) ones that are high quality but also highly limited in quantity stand the best chances… although i do think there’ll be some larger generative pfp type ones that hold up too ….
63,@cryptonattyk ya i think it depends on the project i think for some that number could be appropriate but it’s gonna real have to hav it goin on and that fit for the nature of it…
64,"i think by the very nature of mfers, it’s success will also entail the existence of a number of very successful derivative projects but it will b highly selective as to which those will be - most will flop - some will thrive 🤷‍♂️"
65,another rly big factor that i think will help a lot is thinking abt how the project can b designed to give back to the mfer community at large- like contributing royalties to the @unofficialmfers treasury or wutever other creative ideas
66,imo if your gonna have a chance at being successful as a deriv project it’s essential to not only really put in the work and make the art &amp;concept high quality but also think realistically abt supply!!several K is probably way too many for most projects-even rly cool ones!
67,@tw1tte7 @mfercribs 🤷‍♂️
68,@mfercribs @tw1tte7 ok don’t get me wrong i think it’s cool (minted one in fact) -just hearin a lot of talk hypin up expectations and stuff which isn’t very mfer in my view -but hey i hope this thing does great and I’m lookin forward to seein mine and what pans out with it -rootin for it
69,@tw1tte7 @mfercribs a bit much with the hype-talk here imo…
70,"@inftmaniac @Mfer_Chicks mfers is all about building community that builds together and doesn’t depend on the whims or promises of devs -if it’s something the community wants y’all should band up &amp; make it happen, if not something the community wants then it simply won’t pan out- this is why mfers works"
71,@CryptoLeeloo .069
72,@inftmaniac @Mfer_Chicks mferchicks should build their own if they want to - it’s the mfer way

87,@expectmfers speaking of which we literally do have posmfers @shitoshi 😂 (but to me that cant rly qualify as a 'rug' wen it literally calls itself a piece of shit...)

98,"@kevimlee @WinningMfer @cryptoW1p0 @zhoug @AlienPunkThings it could b like u can connect ur wallet and u can make an edit if ur holding an mfer in ur wallet, for example"
99,@kevimlee @WinningMfer @cryptoW1p0 @zhoug @AlienPunkThings but i honestly have no clue how complicated of a thing that is to make but in theory it seems to me like why not? But i dunno 🤷‍♂️ it’d b cool as fuck
