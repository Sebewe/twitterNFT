I even LOVED working through the hunting lodges to 100% it, bc i felt like the difficulty scaled really well."

it was esp. discouraging that after investing the first 3 years of my career churning out so much specialized writing, my portfolio had not grown accordingly. alas!"
30,"@rosemary_egbo @BrettPucino i relate to this so much. I ghostwrote such a variety of content for a VIP in my first job out of college that was published under their name. 

I remember asking my old boss how to include this stuff in my portfolio, and they were like... you cannot.😅"

47,"@andr3 @drewcoffman any web3 organization that is serious about disrupting anti-NFTers needs to integrate learning &amp; positive use-cases into their communications strategy.

best approach is, ignore the grumps &amp; create content that is accessible &amp; makes the potential benefits of the tech compelling."
48,"@andr3 @drewcoffman Unfortunately I don't think engaging with this crowd on Twitter is the answer; the platform does NOT enable good faith debates. 

Most web2 social platforms are outrage factories, because of the way engagement is incentivized via algorithms."
49,"@drewcoffman yep. i think the key nuance the anti-NFT crowd is missing is that NFTs are like anything else in society. 

There are undeniably scams &amp; bad people in the space, but also brilliant creative people using innovative technology to do very important &amp; cool things."
50,"@drewcoffman @belGIANgwaffles +1. i listened to a podcast ft. @hankgreen, and he was talking about how platforms should change to support creators and I was like... 

sir what you are describing is an NFT."
51,"@drewcoffman whew. we are in a race with a small group of LOUD anti-NFTers to make sure the narrative about web3 that gets to ordinary folks is inspiring &amp; compelling. 

we need to be able to put forward concise, simple arguments that disprove anti-NFTers' poor understanding of this tech..."

Learning about the evolution of asset exchange backwards had me thinking... wow, how did folks tolerate the opaque, centralized version of trade for SO long."
