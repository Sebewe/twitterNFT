9,@Shawnthemon @jwrichte09 @nbatopshot oh I can relate on the feelings. I'm lost on what to collect.  there's a whole lot of us in @TheJurassicPack who had our sets killed because they decided to kick  us in the knee with Vince and then kicked us again while we're down with tmac. 2 legendary bottlenecks in 1 week..
10,@Shawnthemon @jwrichte09 @nbatopshot after an airdrop it has ruined a lot for me. I'm really not down to spend thousands on different sets for 1-3 common packs and then have the value of the set killed after. I just don't expect to make money  anymore. I spent $400-$500 on packs last week and came out -EV bad
11,"@Shawnthemon @jwrichte09 @nbatopshot you're not wrong. my account is down substantially from where it was 3 months ago. definitely cleared out a lot and I'm not happy with the path topshot is on right now, but everytime the market has crashed. it's always corrected at some point. with how bad sets get killed"
12,"@Shawnthemon @jwrichte09 @nbatopshot oh damn that's right. I forgot about the paperwork we all signed when we joined topshot guaranteeing us profits lmao
topshot is here for collecting guy. it's not an investment. not sure who told you it was, but you might wanna take that up with them."
13,"@Shawnthemon @jwrichte09 @nbatopshot it's. a. digital. trading. card. 
people crying because they aren't making money need to leave the platform. you are the worst thing for topshot. topshot wasn't put here so you don't have to work. it's supposed to bring a new level of collecting to the people."
14,@jwrichte09 @Shawnthemon big facts. I say this everyday. nobody takes that into consideration. topshot is supposed to be for collectors not for flippers. while I do agree that 120k Bruce Brown is rough. if you buy a box of physical cards you're very lucky to pull anything that's gonna get your money back

39,"@PackripMahoment the rewards just get killed on the market also. all star weekend was fun, but also enough for me. after seeing the reward prices and how bad the required moments dropped in price. it just isn't worth taking a loss of $400 for a moment that's going for $60"
40,"@varsavja all star weekend while fun, was definately the final straw in flash challenges for me. there is absolutely zero positive to doing them right now. even if you hit a good serial it doesn't seem worth it"
41,@varsavja I should have. dark days are coming 😂
42,@varsavja 3 days ago the KAT throwdown moment was $350. you could use that moment in 2 flash challenges cool makes sense I get that. what I don't get. both rewards combined on those 2 challenges is under $100  and the KAT throwdown is under $90 now
43,"@varsavja I'm usually not concerned with checking values of my moments, but holy shit we are headed back into the dark ages of topshot. everything red. I feel like a lot of these users don't get what topshot is"

54,Love the way @nbatopshot out did themselves during the all-star break. Hoping to see them do the playoff challenges in similar taste to the all-star challenges. The variety of players and moments was on point. Nice not having the superstars being the focal point. Well done!
55,@clt_buzzcity @BALLERZ_NFT Green alien. Team flow. Sold between $11k-$12k. Then I bought 2 more right after that sale at $1800 a piece and recently took a small loss of a few hundred selling them. Hence why I'd buy back in a heartbeat if they start doing things. I'll wear the shit out of this sweater lol
56,@clt_buzzcity @BALLERZ_NFT I did extremely well on ballerz and I'm forever grateful. I made a deal for one of them before the marketplace was open. Around 2100 combo rank for ja morants top shot debut and $700 in dapper. The second one I sold a couple days after market opened. Was around 72 combo ran
57,"@clt_buzzcity @BALLERZ_NFT Didn't mean to come of like a dick. I'm salty about it. Ballerz released months ago and haven't done anything except take months to be available on  marketplace, overcharge holders for merch and then botch the sneaker airdrop. I may buy one again in the future but for now I'm out"
58,"@clt_buzzcity @BALLERZ_NFT LOL yes I put the word ""overpriced"" in there just to complain about getting free overpriced merch? God damn no. This sweater, t-shirt and hat cost more than clothes I buy regularly 😂 it was like $200 for these bro and that was at a discount apparently"
