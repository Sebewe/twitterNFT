1,"@lazyvillager1 @jack_anorak Whether I like these guys or not, I'm a believer in free &amp; independent markets, I would fight tooth and nail for their right to mint, buy and create NFT projects as much as anyone else in this space. 

It was simply an observation and warning of the NFT environment I'm seeing."
2,"@andy8052 Does anyone remember anything in this space? 

How long till we come back to (3,3) round 2? 
OsirisDAO soon."
3,"@jack_anorak @lazyvillager1 This tweet was warning, that much of the 10ks that are suddenly coming out are people like these chumps, which you can see based on how many projects have been doxxed by some random people never involved in crypto now seeing how much money they can make doing a random 10k."
4,"@jack_anorak @lazyvillager1 What I left out was their plan to make a pitch deck. 
To immediately go and get investment. Having someone lead their round at $1M. 

They've done nothing in this space. 
The same people who made fun of us for years for being in crypto now seeing $$$ to be made."
5,"@jack_anorak @lazyvillager1 I'm not gatekeeping, I'm making aware the current environment of NFTs.

These kids don't give a shit about this space. Evident by how they spoke, they haven't bought, traded or done anything in space. They saw dollar signs &amp; immediately went to making a project to suck ETH out."

14,"End of meeting

Talk now most NFT projects are cash grabs. Fanatasizing about how their bosses don’t get it and wanting to prove them wrong. 

Realize they have no expertise in 10pm or tech but think they can bring expertise mba style. I canttt

Literally want ETH to quit job"
15,@saintsonso @la_da_kid Oh they’re for sure here to suck liquidity out
16,"Live tweeting for lunch entertainment 

We’re now discussing market research via “sales funnel”

Oh god do these kids follow me? 

My fav part is I’m in torn jeans and a hoody just listening"
17,"I live in a financial part of town, there’s a bunch of young suits in their patagucci vests discussing their NFT drop at lunch. How they want to set their presale and roadmap. Sending emails for “market audience research”. Use that information as you will."

22,"@krybharat More I think about it, seems like an easy thing for VCs to latch on to and write thought threads on. 

Nothing interesting has come of cc0 (yet)

Almost becomes cop out, make a colleciton, call it cc0, leave the project behind for ""community"", take the ETH go do something else."
23,"Expect many NFT floors to skyrocket, the number of listed NFTs across every major bluechip collection has dramatically plummeted! Hold on to your femboy skirts kids, we going to the moon.

62,"@0xfoobar @0xmons Was thinking this exact thought LOL, or something like options pricing work based on time preference. Could be interesting!"
63,Would be interesting to see mint price around options. Different premiums depending on how long you want to hold your NFT for. Say you're willing to hold NFT for a month so you get a cheaper mint and higher chance to mint than someone who says a day. Some sort of locked contract?
64,"Having friends in the space you can talk to outside of just crypto stuff is huge. Friends to vent to, joke with and just not feel so alone in these emotional rollercoasters. So grateful for Pete's friendship.

Honestly I think NFTs are great and helping democratizing art, royalties, etc. Buttt most of this narrative is around some random pfp that 100xs &amp; people still bag holding from psyops instead of selling for life changing money"
74,@ezrastrauss Wait until they can collateralize and leverage their JPEGs.
75,@andyboyan Come on bro why you spreading negativity in the space. don't you believe wagmi!? When the punishment comes it won't be pretty... turns out holding JPEGs to get another 2x on your 100x was a terrible idea.
76,@VGFreakXBL https://t.co/6Yfy9PHoiq
77,The disillusionment that NFTs are saving the world and lives is astounding. The amount of toxic positivity in this space is dangerous. These are the same influencers that were screaming and yelling misinformation on the phishing hack. Twitter really is just one massive psyop.
