9,"@johnstaz88 There will be consumers.  

I'm not talking about other people.

I'm talking building wealth and how a consumerism mentality can hurt one's ability to build up assets that are going to grow year after year.

31,"Massive $ron er over here.  

Over and out.

Aur."
32,"Sure, you could wait until Month 12 to buy.  

But by then, price may not be so low.  I don't know when it will pump, but I believe it's significantly undervalued compared to the value Ronin Network ownership will represent in the future.

NFA, etc, etc.. 
DYOR, etc, etc.."
33,"I'm wondering if that higher supply growth phase is when user validating goes live.  For every 1 $ron you have, you'll be able to delegate to earn more $ron.

So every one 1 $ron you own today is a multiple of that $ron a couple years forward in exchange for your hodl time."
34,"There are 1 billion $ron tokens to ever exist.

There are 148 million available right now (14.8%) according to Coingecko.

I don't know when user validating will start, but I'm thinking it may be when we see this incline in supply in Month 12 on this supply schedule. https://t.co/KiGRvYMuPG"
35,@JuanHODL You more $ron
36,"the $ron you own today.  

You own the rights to earn more passive $ron tomorrow."
37,"Today, the $ron network is valued at $333 million.

You can say the fully diluted value is a more realistic valuation ($2.24 billion), but owning part of the $ron pool when user validating/staking gets turned on gives you access to more passive $ron.

So you don't just own.."
38,"Now imagine @Ronin_Network reaches mass appeal with billions of users.  

What is owning a percentage of the network bandwidth of something that size worth?

Not saying that global domination is guaranteed, but I don't think anyone else is positioned to achieve it more quickly."
39,"Your $ron will give you rights to stake or delegate your tokens for more tokens in exchange for securing the network.  

Accumulating a position in $ron today means your right to earn more tokens through validating tomorrow.

A right to be a toll booth on @Ronin_Network."
40,"Eventually, there will be many games on Ronin.

Imagine it's 2025.  

Imagine there are now 50 games on Ronin.  

Imagine hundreds of millions of users and the liquidity that comes with numbers like that.

Think longer term."
41,"Buying $ron right now could be compared to buying the $eth presale, but for the @Ronin_Network.

$ron is network fuel just like $eth.  

Eventually, every transaction performed (excluding free txs, which will be turned down) on Ronin will require $ron.

Think longer term."
42,@JuanHODL Yes.  I think it's a huge opportunity.
43,"@JuanHODL Got turned into $ron.  

I think $ygg is a great investment, but I decided that $ron is too undervalued.  I plan to rebuild my position in $ygg, but building the biggest position I can in $ron while it's young is my top priority."
