1,"@xBenJamminx So you’re saying that if I make a custom contract specifically for this drop, spend over 250k in eth to buy 500.. I’m gonna send these back to the devs for free? Instead of selling for 2.6m? Surely not an insider, 100% believable! You got it https://t.co/asUTYFcwRL"

3,And it won’t stop until the bubble pops or we demand full transparency with names/socials for dev teams in these projects we invest thousands into. Today was the last time I watched good people get burnt by shady business practices.
4,"It’s a common marketing method called the mother/child method. It has somewhat died out for conventional means of growing accounts, but for NFTs? It’s huge. Especially for giveaways. Make a new project, send a RT from your 10k+ account, boom."
5,"One thing many of you do not understand is a lot of projects you see and ape into are basically franchises owned by one large crooked corporation. They don’t mention they’re connected, yet they are able to pump one another through sly RTs on their “mother” accounts."

9,@xBenJamminx Would you send 35 eth + an absurd amount of gas minting fees + transfer fees you spent back for free over 750 eth? https://t.co/lAsIet4pSQ
10,@shinny427 @noodledudeman Wait I can’t math I’m stupid let me rephrase that. Would you send the dev team 35 eth + gas on a goodwill gamble when you can bag a guaranteed 750 eth at a 1.5 floor?
11,@shinny427 @noodledudeman If this statement isn’t fishy to you idk what to tell you tbh. Would you give up guaranteed 120k+ USD for gambling NFTs hoping your bags pump more? I stand by my 3 wallet theory https://t.co/RG9l3meG63
12,@noodledudeman @Droksid @thesevens_7 Would you send 35 Eth + an absurd amount of gas in minting + transfer fees back to the devs for free? It’s fishy regardless. NFTs can crash at any given moment. I don’t know many sane people that would risk guaranteed hundreds of thousands of dollars for a gamble. https://t.co/qajQlZwoDY
13,Would you send 500 tokens back to their marketing wallet free of charge? 35 eth that you technically spent fairly since it is not your fault? Not even factoring in how much gas was wasted also? https://t.co/JsDdu4lrH6

15,@Uncle7NFT @thesevens_7 @xBenJamminx @beaniemaxi @digitalartchick @garyvee It legit looks like a cover up.. why on earth would anyone send back 500 .07 NFTs + gas for free?! The gas fees themselves were astronomically high!
16,Thank you for explaining what I was trying. It looks like money laundering with eth to me and the third wallet is the dev wallet where all NFTs are being sent back to. Going 2 to 1 then 1 to 2 is pretty fishy.. https://t.co/vjCD8KlIiw
17,@xBenJamminx Added onto the thread. There’s no direct 110% dev connection from the fund aspect. But the 800 eth payout is why I’m suspecting they sent them back. No other reason to send back 1500 eth?
18,Used wrong verbiage and played myself. It’s not directly the dev wallet. But a 800 eth payout would be suffice to send these back don’t you agree? 3 wallets is all it takes. Until I see proof of why the minter sent all of them back I’ll stand by my theory.
19,"@shinny427 @digitalartchick @thesevens_7 @xBenJamminx @beaniemaxi @garyvee DYOR. It’s fishy, it’s shady and does not add up at all. 3 wallets can make things look so innocent."
20,@digitalartchick @thesevens_7 @xBenJamminx @beaniemaxi @garyvee Why on earth would someone who minted 1000 send them all back for free? A 800 eth payout makes it seem believable. That was most likely going to be their announcement as well to get the community all riled up again. They made a new wallet for the transfer to try and hide this.
21,"https://t.co/azhf34Gsyv

This is the transaction where @thesevens_7 dev sent 802 eth to the person who minted 1,000. To act like they covered their tracks and are doing good for the community by buying all 1k back for the community."
22,"As you can see here, this is the wallet that @thesevens_7 dev sent 100 eth to 6 days ago. This is the same person who minted 1,000+ which is 100% proven at this point. Also one other thing to note, and comical I might add https://t.co/PyAfjasMeX"
23,Here is the wallet they sent 100 eth to 6 days ago. Let’s head on over to their ERC-721 tokens and see… https://t.co/kp03uUO2E6
24,Here is the transaction I posted. 6 days &amp; 6 hours ago @thesevens_7 dev wallet is circled here. They sent 100 eth to the same exact person who minted 1k + today. https://t.co/0nct1w0zaR
25,"@wrecklessbr4d @MZeeFi @thesevens_7 @xBenJamminx @beaniemaxi @digitalartchick @garyvee You’re not following. They sent the person who minted 1,000, 100 eth 6 days ago…"
26,"Hey @thesevens_7 why did you send 100 eth to the wallet that minted 1,000 6 days ago??

https://t.co/3NopCBwByS

The blockchain never lies. @xBenJamminx @beaniemaxi @digitalartchick @garyvee what do y’all think?

#nft #NFTCommunity #wearethescammers"
27,My theory is this: inside job the entire time. Create a scandal and make bank off selling back to the market. Then perform the heroic act of getting in touch with this “scammer” and sending all 1k back to their main account. Thus the team only lost gas $
28,This is the wallet that had 1k. Why do they only have 10.48 eth here? Surely the @thesevens_7 team would to have paid them hundreds of eth to do this. Would you take 10 eth over 1500 eth? Just doesn’t make any sense. https://t.co/MDwl9GNQS3
29,"https://t.co/oUsnzSSzg1

This is the wallet sending back 1k NFTs to the team. Instead of selling them one by one and making an absolute fortune. How convenient right? I know if I pocketed 1k from their faulty contract, I certainly wouldn’t give them back."
30,"Just got kicked from @thesevens_7 discord for calling them out on the most fishy shit I’ve ever seen in my life.

31,@iiBerZerKk @thesevens_7 @alcabonesNFT They’re getting rid of v1 and thats when the stats are gonna transfer over. Sorry if you lost a full eth on these 😂
32,"This whole @thesevens_7 shit show is for sure an inside job. That announcement was the icing on the cake. “We knew this could happen but didn’t want to go against the norm.”

59,@DistressedPickL @alcabonesNFT What a fucking clown comment. I bought 5 at .2 and was whitelisted and still couldn’t mint any. I’m still sticking around. Go back to your fucking pickles 😂
60,@DistressedPickL @alcabonesNFT It’s literally just the contract uri. I’m much happier they let us know now instead of revealing and those changing their bones to rares and making millions before it was public knowledge? They kick people that spew nonsense and don’t read their announcements.
61,@refaldimarlay @heybentan https://t.co/amOEbd07iI
