Thoughts? Or, any other strong community in the range 0.5-1 ETH floor?"
54,@LordPagliarello @facebookapp Apparently they removed it without thinking of the consequences.
55,@LordPagliarello @facebookapp It requires a code generator that USED  to be in the app.
56,@LordPagliarello @facebookapp Nope
57,@LordPagliarello @facebookapp Tried everything. The bug is the code generator that I had to use for 2-factors auth. They removed it from the app! So now I don’t have any way to fix it.
