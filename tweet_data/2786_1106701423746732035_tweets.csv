If you'd care about this space you wouldn't use every sec to shill your shit"
27,Someone at @Sothebys seriously thought it's a great idea to put someone with views on Punks and LL like his on stage for an auction. It's time to flush bad actors out of this space 🤡 https://t.co/cegWdzmCtk
28,"@kennyschac @camillionaire_m @mojito_nft @co1born @Sherone33 @Sothebys @Sothebysverse @MuseumofCrypto I shouldn’t even be replying to his. Go back to selling your ""NFTism"" and Hoodies. We've been here before you and we'll be here after you left cash grabbing with your sub-par brainless projects. Maybe you can find some more things to trademark."

30,"@camillionaire_m @mojito_nft @co1born @Sherone33 @kennyschac @Sothebys @Sothebysverse @MuseumofCrypto I've never seen a worse panel, this circlejerk was an insult to every punk owner imo, a guy full of himself shilling his own stuff, a proclaimed ""cryptopunk expert""...

64,@Hodling_hodler Maybe this space wasn’t for you after all 👋🏼
65,@Hodling_hodler If you‘re a proponent of web3 you should make use of the tools you‘re given. Buy ($ENS) or make your voice heard to a delegate to express your views through voting power. You‘re literally free to propose anything you like with enough support.

69,"@DaRealMilkBagz @farokh @MichaelTant3 @infamousXBT @nicksdjohnson @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains You're right, he's free to say and believe whatever he wants, unless he's in a publicly exposed position which requires responsibility, he's obviously lacking sensibility expressing and defending his questionable thoughts and thus could be a ticking timebomb for $ENS &amp; $ETH rep."
70,@damedoteth I'd like your support on this @damedoteth 🤝 https://t.co/ehgk4qAnTu
71,"This is not a vote about his freedom of expression, he can say and believe whatever he wants, just not in a highly exposed position that comes with a lot of #responsibility. Him expressing those views is not sensible enough &amp; can be highly damaging for $ENS and even $ETH, unfit!"
72,"@EarlyNFT @ZsMann @pepcasso @BrantlyMillegan What kind of take is this? This is not a vote about his freedom of expression, he can say and believe whatever he wants, just not in a highly exposed position that comes with a lot of responsibility. Him expressing those views can be highly damaging for $ENS and even $ETH, unfit!"
73,@pepcasso @ZsMann @EarlyNFT @BrantlyMillegan You clearly don't want to understand that this is not about someone expressing any views. This is about someone - in his publicly exposed position - not catering to the responsibility this position requires.
74,"@pepcasso @ZsMann @EarlyNFT @BrantlyMillegan I happily agree to disagree. This has nothing to do with cancel culture, this is about someone expressing views like his being fit for the position and #responsibility he holds. Things like these have deep repercussions in how the public sees $ENS and $ETH. Everyone can vote."
75,@ZsMann @pepcasso @EarlyNFT @BrantlyMillegan This is not a question on whether he has the right to say what he wants or to believe what he wants - we're voting if we see someone with his views capable of working a very exposed position within §ENS with all the #responsibilty coming with it.
76,"@irreverent_nft There's more you can do, you don't need $ to become a vocal person, enlighten folks on your opinion, educate &amp; get them to vote in favor of your point of view or become a delegate with laid out principles. There's multiple ways to collect votes for what you think is the right way"
77,"If you're thinking of removing your .eth name or dumping your $ENS, this is mere virtue signalling. We have a DAO for this, buy (more) $ENS, make your opinion heard through voting power."
78,"@digitalartchick This is not how you make your opinion heard. There is a DAO for this to vote hate out of a system, removing your .eth is mere virtue signalling, buy $ENS and vote him out with us."

84,4) Seeing @coinbase is one of the biggest $ENS delegates I think it would be very helpful to have someone from their side help us interimistically dodge and answer all coming bad press until we install someone responsible for our PR. There should be a seperate vote on this...
85,3) I would like to vote on his immediate removal and hire someone responsible for all PR agendas. The dent the $ENS ecosystems (and also Ethereums) rep could take from this is not to be underestimated so this should be a high priority matter...
