9,"@boxofcorey Got it. You're right, I just double checked and it looks like there's only 1,819 (between the 4 items) in circulation. We'll see how it plays out."
10,Is there a reason the BAYC polygon wearables (hoodie and JMA) are now getting offers? Was something announced or purely speculation?

23,Wits outweighed brute force in the #guildQuest for @2112Run . But what I really want to know is what hip hop from 2112 sounds like. What a fun and engaging way to mintlist into a project. Looking forward to diving in a bit more. @zerodarkbirdy @quaneeboi10 @2112Run
24,"@futureformxyz Thanks, I'll look into it. Do you find that it leaves room for flexibility from the other variables (grind size, water temp, etc)? I want to upgrade my morning coffee experience but also don't want to make it another one of my ""weekend french press"" rituals."

44,@NathanHeadPhoto It's funny how quickly I've lost perspective of money in this space. I remember when paying ~$30-40 for gas was outrageous. And now if it dips below 100 gwei I feel like I've perfectly timed it lol.
