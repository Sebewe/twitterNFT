32,"I just took a look at the inactive listings tab on @opensea, and it's full of listings of stuff that sold, but that I previously used the lower price option on. I would've thought selling something would cancel all of the listings, but I guess not?"
33,@tmophoto @BoredApeYC It'll take so long to get to that point though
34,@0Dogeman0 @BoredApeYC I don't think they're earning anything from this game. There aren't microtransctions or anything
35,"@DolliesNFT @BoredApeYC Some of the beginning levels can be somewhat challenging. But after unlocking the third tier of apes/mutants, it gets pretty easy. Some people are saying it gets harder at level 150 or 200, but that's a huge commitment to even get to that point"
36,@jbashdown @BoredApeYC Same exact thing for me. Finally reached 500 last night and then woke up at almost 100 spots lower. Not worth the grind imo
37,@TyphaneyBdev @BoredApeYC Lmao so true 😂
38,Lmao this dude right click saved my ape and edited it to be a hexagon 😭🤣 I have an android otherwise I'd do the nft pfp verification https://t.co/UiS4idwZca
39,"@MadamSavvy @BoredApeYC I actually think your art example is what this competition should've been more like. Those without a job will have an advantage, but it's not guaranteed that they win. This game is more like if the art contest was whoever creates the most pieces of artwork in a week wins"
40,"@kidzula @BoredApeYC Anyone can play, but only ape/mutant holders can register and win prizes"
41,"@MadamSavvy @BoredApeYC I'm saying it's toxic because depending on the prize people are going for, they're kinda forced to play every 2 hours. They can't work, go out, or even sleep. I get that the people playing more will have a better shot, but that shouldn't be the only thing that matters"
42,"@ApeStackin @BoredApeYC Interesting, I haven't made it that far. I finally reached rank 500 after level 110 or so last night, but I woke up and lost almost 100 spots. I don't know if it's worth it to try and keep up"
43,"While I think the @BoredApeYC mobile game is fun, the model of the competition is pretty toxic. It rewards total time played instead of skill, and anyone that can't play all the time doesn't really have a shot"

50,@emilecrypto Yea I know lol. I'm saying it should default to that
51,"So OpenSea defaults to filtering projects by ""Price: Low to High."" But having to scroll through items that aren't for sale but have low offers is frustating. It's not helpful seeing stuff with 0.00000000001eth offers first"

70,@JiroNFT @BoredApeYC I forgot about this
71,@shadows_eth @NftTrader @PartyDegens I think the biggest reason that people started using it is because Opensea started taking a percentage from private sales. But it does also take away the cut that would normally go to artists
72,"I'm reading more and more stories of people getting hacked that start with someone that they're trying to make a deal with claims NFTTrader isn't working. That is the signal! If they say this, it's most likely a scam. Don't get on a call, don't share your screen. Just block them"
