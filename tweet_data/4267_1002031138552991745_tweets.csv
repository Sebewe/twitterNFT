1,Regular expressions are pretty magical too
2,"California mask mandate lifts tomorrow. In the county I live in, I’m still required to wear a mask. But in the county I work in, I’m not! But on the bus to work, I am!

I’m gonna be carrying a mask around for the next 5 years just in case, aren’t I?"

9,a token gated group chat with a twist: you can only see messages from people with &lt;= number of tokens you have
10,@0xgoddess Emphasis on usually…lol. Pretty sure my car has appreciated since I bought it.
11,I think we’ll both be happier if I call you back once I’m done defecating
12,"I’d much rather miss a call than talk on the phone in a public restroom. 

Unfortunately, not everyone agrees with this.

Talking to you, man pooping next to me having a conversation with his wife, as toilets flush all around us."
13,Witch sold for pi eth https://t.co/Xcbj9SJpJt
14,Witches are ultra sound money
15,Sell JPEGs to pay off car loan or sell car to buy more JPEGs?
16,"NFTs are a wild ride. 

ETH has dumped almost half its value in the last week. 

Most of my NFT “investments” have trended toward zero. 

But one small NFT investment I made went up by almost 40x

So I’m up by 50% overall."

34,Work is what I do while waiting for my NFTs to moon
35,"@yachtmommii Mmmm fair point…still not sure I buy it but that’s reasonable at least. 

Personally think things will get much weirder before the top — we haven’t even gone hardcore yet!"
36,"I don’t understand why everyone is concerned about these simpDAOs being a top signal. 

Roughly 30% of the internet is pornography. If anything, simpDAOs are a sign of true mass adoption.

And let’s be honest — if this is porn’s manifestation in web3 — it’s pretty mild… https://t.co/tKjmgQEwcn"
37,"@nptacek @MTAverseNYC Wow!! Thank you thank you, I will cherish it forever!"
38,"Degenerate: an immoral or corrupt person

45,Discord DMs are the scariest corner of social media
46,"5. Something special - I hate “utility” - I’m just looking for something unique/special about the project, that’s all."
47,"4. Community - less important than when playing the long game, but I’ll still always hop in the discord to make sure there’s some activity and nothing toxic. Volume is usually a decent proxy for community, for my purposes."
48,"Criteria for “project I like”:

1. Volume - the more volume, the more trades I can make. The more trades I make, the more profit I make. 

2. Art that I like. If it goes to zero, at least I like the art. 

3. Cheap - (&lt;0.5E) - mainly because I’m poor. Also limits downside"
49,"Old NFT strategy: find a project I like and buy the floor. Wait for floor to rise, sell. 

New NFT strategy: find a project I like and buy one of the most favorited/most viewed for cheap. Immediately list for 2x and wait for it to sell."
50,"CDC says just wetting your fingeys isn’t an effective hand-washing method, despite prior recommendations."
51,@itstylersays Is this financial advice?
52,"From Wikipedia:

""a cult is a social group that is defined by its unusual religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or its common interest in a particular personality, object, or goal."""
53,"I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with this — I'm not against cults, as long as they aren't the type of cult that harms/kills people.

I'm sure I'm not the first to make this comparison, also. But every definition I find fits it pretty perfectly."
54,"This started as an idle thought, but it fits the definition of a cult shockingly well:

""a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister.""

""a misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing."""
55,"- it costs thousands of dollars to join
- small group of like-minded individuals in the community
- usually some charismatic leaders in the cult
- internal memes / code phrases to signal you're part of the cult
- all believe in the same thing (number go up)"
56,Let's be honest: buying an NFT is essentially the same thing as joining a cult.

64,RT @Jest_Iris: the helium shortage is only being made worse by inflation
65,"@0xMC2 Oh shit, will definitely look into that as an option as well. The tax hit is one of my biggest concerns right now — hard to stomach an instantaneous 50% loss 🥴🥴

Thanks for sharing that!"
66,"@0xgoddess @swolidity Yeah makes total sense, thanks for sharing it!

Very fair/important points"
67,"@swolidity Yeah I’ve actually done something similar in the past — not with retirement money but a decent chunk of cash just to get some time off from working full time. 

Now I’m pretty happy at my job but still looking for ways to accelerate toward financial independence/“retirement”"
68,"I just can’t find a way to match the potential upside of crypto in a traditional investment portfolio.

Stocks just don’t 7x in a week like NFTs can and do."
69,"After being active in the web3 space for about 6 months, am considering cashing out a significant chunk of my IRA (currently invested in relatively safe tech stocks) for ETH/NFTs. 

Obv this is riskier than an IRA, but I’m only 28 and I’ve got a pretty high risk tolerance."

Imagine if you could instantly port your reputation (followers, posts &amp; likes) from Instagram to Twitter to Facebook.

Another interesting example: https://t.co/R0o4wC8hYw"
85,"@swolidity Not sure exactly what DB @cminxi used to build it, but its some form of centralized database"
86,"@swolidity Ofc there is some interaction with blockchain here, since it's based on ENS...but the messages are stored in a database.

Is that the right call? For now, probably, because that's the only practical option...but who knows what might be practical a year from now?"
87,"@swolidity Sounds like a good rule of thumb for NFTs specifically I think, but not everything on a blockchain will be NFTs.

Here's an example that doesn't fit so neatly into the NFT world: a messaging app based on ENS https://t.co/zrW8fboV4s"
