34,These commercials. 😐 kinda mid not gonna lie…
35,@rugburners Awesome I appreciate that
36,"@rugburners Feel like this needs to be promoted more. Like announcement of what the ""hotbox"" is each time and what the airdrop is going to be and when. I have a Rugburn NFT and it seems confusing for potential buyers. Not a lot of promo and info out there..."

39,If there's one project I'm most excited for it's @InvsbleFriends. The art is insane and I truly believe this will not only become one of the biggest collections in the space but a huge part of the culture of it too. To show my support I created this. @MotionMarkus what you think? https://t.co/YX5RkRoiEE

60,The first “MetaVerse” will definitely drop this week. 🗓
61,"3:49am. Can’t sleep. Just thought of a sick idea though. I’m gonna start an experimental music NFT project called “MetaVerses”. They’ll be short music NFTs with videos too. Excited to get creative with this! • (PS. Don’t worry, I’ll still be dropping non-NFT music stuff too. 👍)"
62,I took “First Love” by @utadahikaru &amp; remixed it. Her music means a lot to me ever since being completely blown away by the Kingdom Hearts opening as a kid. Kept this simple &amp; clean but I hope you like it. Pun intended. • #music #rap #remix #日本語 #ラップ #ラッパー https://t.co/RjoshZHiQc

78,@LivesOfAsuna PLEASE.
79,Dude when @Coinbase_NFT drops it is going to cause an extreme #NFT bull run. I think the “cute” collections will pump like crazy. Just my opinion. https://t.co/XGKN6gVI0r
80,@OttoSuwenNFT @WoodiesNFT 100% gonna pump. Looks like the perfect @Coinbase_NFT collab tbh
81,I think @SpaceYetisNFT can push 1 ETH+
82,Can’t wait to see what NFTs pump tonight lol as soon as gas gets low things go crazy every time 👀
