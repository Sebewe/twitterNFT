58,"You can donate items and your time. If I can help any Australians in anyway, please feel to reach out and I’ll try my best to help 💛💚🇦🇺 it breaks my heart being so far away right now."
59,"This has hit home for me, my mums house downstairs is flooded but they are okay. Others haven’t been as lucky and even after the water leaves there will be mess to clean up and shelters to stay in until then can find a new home or solution. You don’t have to donate just money!"
60,Its called ‘drops of salvation’ I thought it was only fitting that It was an Australian waterfall from my ‘Tears of the Sky’ collection. It’s not only the Sky that’s crying right now. Here is the foundation I’ll be donating to. https://t.co/p2bqO3jojM
61,It didn’t feel right of me to donate to support our friends in Ukraine without looking after my family in Australia as well. Flash floods in QLD are taking peoples lives and homes. 50% of profits from ‘Drops of salvation’ will be donated. https://t.co/E1PPlhDGu9 https://t.co/Ky1kS0kSXk
