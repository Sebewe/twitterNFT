2,"@Arsh0x1 @ETHeyAndBeTChy @el33th4xor The answer is Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Starkware etc."
3,"Bitcoin maxis rejoicing at the outlook of crypto regulations shows us that—despite what they claim—they don’t care about anything but their own net worth. Begs the question: Why don’t they ape into the asset that outperforms BTC since forever?

It’s called Ethereum."
4,@EthDegi @epolynya He has been fired from TNL and voted out by the DAO. That’s pretty much as strong an answer as you could wish for.
5,@InsideTheSim It do be like that. Same here.
6,@exularoye @c477bfef6df4311 @0xIndigo Might want to rewatch that episode. He said that Ethereum *as a project* is ~50% done.

8,"@AdrianoFeria I mean few, but they exist!"
9,@AdrianoFeria I visited the EOS subreddit yesterday for fun. There are still people believing in this project. Can you imagine?
10,@JaEsf @antiprosynth @RyanSAdams The difference being that Solanas approach is not scaling (you can’t just throw more and more expensive hardware at this problem) while L2s are effectively scaling the base layer.

12,@JoeySheisty @alienfrens Absolutely!

18,"@Nemo103108 @AdrianoFeria @Dennis_Porter_ Can you pay your taxes in ""Time"" and ""Energy"" directly?"
19,@Padierfind Sounds like $ETH is heavily on your mind. Wanna talk about it?
20,@l2beatcom Could we get L2s to give statements that could be collected on L2Beat?
21,"@TAIGxrp @digitalassetbuy @JohnEDeaton1 @attorneyjeremy1 @XRPNews_ @_XRpizza ""Some may use the technology, but no one will use the underlying coin … Ditto for Ether vs Ethereum"".

27,"@cobie @iamDCinvestor Ethereum being content with the current situation of being a chain for rich kids has to be the worst, most dishonest take i’ve seen in a while. Ethereum is one of the only chains actually working to advance this space and be better. 

Horrible take."

32,@DoomChild2 @puntedDecision @eevee You are reasoning as if there’s only ever one wallet to your digital identity. The idea here is that you are in control what informations (which wallet) you disclose (use to login etc.)
33,"@JonathanJoffe @BrantlyMillegan And offline, too. 😂"
34,@Swagtimus Solana is certainly down a lot.
35,"@cryptofrog08 @crypto_y2k @CatfishFishy @ThinkingUSD Ethereum has never gone down. Solana is a short-term tps cash grab that VCs set up for dumb retail. The emperor has no clothes, it’s quite clear if you are not blinded by your bags."
36,"@iamDCinvestor I’d be lying if I said this is not fazing me each and every cycle. But as long as Ethereum as a network and a community is getting stronger and stronger, I can live with that."
37,@iii_OIO_iii @evan_van_ness Well if you need to hear the obvious: Ethereum is the most useful and most used chain.
38,RT @jstn: and no one bought ethereum ever again. the end
39,"@wholisticguy @Jstodd_ @MuteDialog Well we’ll see, none of us can look into the future. Don’t discount the effects of a maturing L2 market though."
40,"@wholisticguy @Jstodd_ @MuteDialog It’s really simple and there are no huge assumptions. Ether becomes too deflationary: Less incentive to use it as intended, more incentive to just hold. Less usage = less demand. Less demand = less burn. Less burn = less deflation."
41,"@wholisticguy @Jstodd_ @MuteDialog What are you on about? Minimum viable issuance is Ethereums policy. 1559 has self-regulating properties. If the deflation gets strong enough to impact people using the chain, it will go down again because the burn is proportionally to the usage of the network."
42,@yourcryptogod @TakeanPhoenix @nessvno @renatocarmo__ What a strong rebuttal. Maybe educate yourself on terms before you fling them around.

47,@Swagtimus What are we expecting when even Hosk is lying about it?
48,@ethlongmusk ENS is a pure governance token and giving out revenue to the holders is against the constitution. So I guess there’s not much to be speculating on here.
49,@ColdHandsCrypto @cobie @VitalikButerin How’s your pet rock doing?
50,@RyanSAdams Bye.
51,@FR3UD_ @mad_tez @CoinDesk That’s what layer 2s are for. Has been common knowledge to people who follow Ethereum development since 2 years pr so.
52,@aubreystrobel We all know what motivated you. Your bags.
53,@__weesh__ @alienfrens Ironically hoarders are weakening the very projects they hoard because # of owners is an important metric to value projects.
54,"@Foobazzler @flexpool_io They managed to rally the Ethereum community to support 1559. So thanks for that, I guess! 👍"
55,"@0xPicasso @TheNaturalCube @FailedTx @34dr1Rk @LionLegendsNFT @imBagsy Don’t confuse them man, they still think Vitalik is setting the gas prices himself each day. 😂"
56,@Zihaojng @BrantlyMillegan I mean I love the concept of DAOs but you have a point. They’re messy. No reason not to try tho.

65,"Years and years of talk, little tangible results apart from social media shilling and a dPoS chain that is pretty much solely used for staking. Now CH is feeling the heat, scrambling to get someone to build on his god forsaken, peer-reviews ghost network. #Cardano in a nutshell."
66,"@iamDCinvestor @bitcoinpanda69 I blame to signal-to-noise ratio. There’s an abundance of information but most of it is trash.

Also social media algorithms make it easy for you to just be fed what you want to hear."
67,@iamDCinvestor Agreed here. Is there a tool to check the  wallets that have the most of a given series of nfts?

84,"@BTCGandalf If the actual usage of Ethereum declines due to deflation, Ethereum automatically becomes inflationary again. Magic, right?"
85,@walkingonwater0 @Tammym22071395 @SpencerKSchiff @econoar Consensus works the same on Ethereum. Around 5k or so nodes. You can actually run an Ethereum full node on a Raspberry Pi4.
86,"@willworthdev @EthereumJesus I am expecting to see an increase in overall demand following the maturation of L2s. The lower fees will mean that way more people will be able to use Ethereum, eventhough the transactions themselves will be bundled / compressed."
87,"@printer_brrr We were never gone, brother."
88,"@alexisohanian I love it, but probably too early to say how this will play out. One thing to note is that it seems as if opensea opened themselves up to this by their inaction."

90,@Makochin_tw @SpencerKSchiff @econoar Vitalik has no power to decide anything. Case in point: He wanted to have EIP-4488 implemented before the merge. Didn’t happen because no consensus. You guys can lie all you want but you won’t stop Ethereum.
91,"@Tammym22071395 @SpencerKSchiff @econoar None, same as Bitcoin. All protocol decisions are made via consensus.

Ethereum has a policy though, minimum viable issuance. A policy/principle Bitcoin lacks."
92,@RB3475 @SpencerKSchiff @econoar Oh BTC issuance can absolutely change. It’s a feature of consensus just s it is on Ethereum.
