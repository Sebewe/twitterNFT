61,"Bottom line: 

Start thinking about investments that allow you to 'legally' avoid taxes on all your income streams!"
62,"Two other tax gifts for real estate investors:

1) The 1031 like-kind exchange, which allows rolling gains into similar investments within 6 months. 

2) A stepped up cost basis when property is passed down to heirs. Plus heirs can depreciate the building all over again!"
63,"Real estate depreciation and loan interest are two widely used deductions used, which can effectively create a multi-million dollar tax avoidance strategy. 

Example: if you spent $100M building a property, you can deduct that full expense over time."
64,"It's very legal to funnel business tax deductions onto personal returns - often seeing this in the real estate and oil industries. 

Congress created massive tax deductions in these industries to spur investment into housing and energy.

You can offset a lot of wealth this way! https://t.co/5IJ6ADM5IJ"
