4,@Route2FI Pizza game is fun but you’re not actively playing it. Manage a pizza restaurant and print $pizza and $soda. Simple yet complex game theory with defi mechanics.

78,"Crazy to think last year...
$BTC was at $32K and is now at $46K
$ETH was at $1K and is now at $3.8K
$BNB was at $40 and is now at $520
$SOL was at $2.50 and is now at $170
$AVAX was at $3 and is now at $109
and
$ADA was a shitcoin and is now still a shitcoin"
79,"7/ And of course, happy new year!! WAGMI!!!"
80,"6/ 2022 will be great if you put in the work. The universe rewards those who deserve it. Karma is real. It literally translates into ""action."" Your results will be directly related to your actions. If you treat people like 💩, what do you think happens to you?"
81,"5/ My theme for 2022 is ""LESS IS MORE."" There's so much innovation in crypt and NFT's its hard to know what to spend your time on. How do you determine what's important to you? What will you focus on this year?"
82,"4/ Life is a gift; what we do with it is our gift back. Make sure to give back to others when you can, giving back doesn't have to be monetary, but it's always rewarding to the gifter. Strength in numbers."
83,3/ Remember what Warren Buffet has taught us: “Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful.” The bull run is not even close to over. Do you have a plan in place? At what point will you secure your bag? What is your process for doing this?
84,"2/ My best advice for the new year is to stay humble. We're all gonna make bank this year but if it gets to your head you'll be back at square 1 before you know it. The story of Icarus happens in every realm - sports, finance, art, business, you name it. Crypto is no different."
85,1/ It's a great time to reflect and think about your goals. What do you want to achieve in 2022? What do you need to do to get there? What will stop you from reaching your goals? Some random and general thoughts...
