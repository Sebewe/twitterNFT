44,"@DragonstormHS @e_turgeneva @opensea @LooksRareNFT yes and also if the artist has absolute ZERO presence with their art before the mints, they should be questioned! the main issue I see too is people claiming to be artists but created their ""art"" accounts 2 days before minting their first work! is very fishy to me"
