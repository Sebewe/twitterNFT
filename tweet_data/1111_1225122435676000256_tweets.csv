0,@0xdoc1 we don't talk about IL for now. let's figure out whether I have correct calculation. IL can't be avoided.
1,"correct me if I'm wrong.
$LOOKS/ETH pair on uniswap v3 currently has 223.59K 24h fees and TVL is 11.08M
223.59K/11.08M, does it mean 2% daily return? 736% APR?"
2,@WojTechAnt @Ronin_Network when do you think will they release single staking? 3 Feb?
3,@AdnaneAnasMa no I will hold
4,$RON farmed for 30k usd per day? https://t.co/Kd69LVHjc6
5,that's for one day farmed. https://t.co/Vf6yzR14MR
6,"@AxieAur I did not see any pending reward to claim, 9PM already."
7,@tomsimps0n @Ronin_Network it is only a topic of how heavy the position is
8,@DonKace11 @wreckdrxie @Ronin_Network I guess 4 Feb
9,@magicians1029 I might switch to looks
10,@iamvaloel @Ronin_Network I guess 900%
11,@magicians1029 see if ron staking will be online.
12,I believe $RON will pump once Binance list it. https://t.co/YuPJpqXPgu
13,@AxieAur you swapped SLP for RON already? that will lose one day farming yield.
14,@AxieAur bro! I replied several of your tweets but you never replied.
15,@DakotaAnderson8 I've no idea how SLP will go further. I am not Axie players.
16,@w1n57on1 @Ronin_Network I might stay on eth/ron or moves to $looks
17,@w1n57on1 @Ronin_Network I think worth.
18,@DanielFA99 184%
19,@TakeshiKovacs66 @Ronin_Network bring my $2.6 breakeven price caused by IL
20,@marialaura_vd @Ronin_Network yes I think ron/eth better.
21,"@AxieAur if you swap from SLP for RON now, you lose one day revenue."
22,@DonKace11 @wreckdrxie @Ronin_Network what will pump SLP
23,@AxieAur you swap from slp/eth or you top up new ETH?
24,@Mi_ho105 @7facelessman @Ronin_Network pull from pool. swap and stake.
25,@wreckdrxie @Ronin_Network you are really worrying about RON to dump?
26,@7facelessman @Ronin_Network ron  pool higher obviously for now

28,@UMotivesYT @Ronin_Network same opinion here.
29,@magicians1029 @BoredApeG did you see any whale wallet withdraw from staking
30,@BoredApeG @magicians1029 $ looks dipped a lot today.  Impermanent loss of $Ron is not too much as eth and slp dumped at the same time.
31,@BoredApeG ok! all in!
32,@BoredApeG next 90 days? any official announcement?
33,@Vectronn no one knows
34,I might move my SLP/ETH pair to stake $Looks or Looks/ETH pair to farm 700% or 500% APR once $Ron farming ends in early Feb. Will $Ron staking start? Or will $Ron farming be extended? https://t.co/5KXQ2TI3Fm

44,"@de_mysti_fi in the scenario, $RON is farmable by both SLP/ETH pair and $RON single staking."
45,"$RON prep price came out. at $4.9 currently. After today's dump on crypto market, for me my breakeven cost is $2.6 per $ron. ETH based calculation. Most of my SLP position was at $0.075.

46,@wengkendotcom this is a post from my friend.
47,"@magicians1029 I'm one of the top farmers, but maybe not top holders."
48,"3/3 out $15k about 10 days prior to the end and leaving the remainder. 
What’s your thoughts? 

On a side note, if the second round of farming to earn ron involves staking existing ron, ron will go to the moon coz most will be locked up and if anyone wants to earn it they need it"
49,"2/3 3. If ron gets released and the price is high, noobs getting in late to earn ron may provide exit liquidity for us. 

It is a risk to hold slp until the end of devs don’t announce something soon, especially for someone as much as you. My liquidity is $50k and I will be taking"
50,"1/3 a friend's analysis
The slp dumping after ron ends is something I have been thinking about too. 
Currently I’m thinking: 
1. Devs will announce an slp burn mechanism or adjustment. 
2. If they don’t do this they will announce slp and ron farm for more ron."
51,@Dragooshi aha.z  why 69%.  lucky number for you?
52,agree most but supply is 0.1B when farming ends. https://t.co/9d4xKuyjAl
53,@0xSnorlax 0.1B supply at launch.  I don't think you calculate it as 1 Billion is the correct way
54,@Godwindefi I tuned it on now. u can dm now.
55,@Dragooshi $Ron farming ends on 5 Feb. Origin before 5 Feb?
56,@Godwindefi why not dm me?
57,"lets discuss what's gonna happen when farming $Ron ends.
With 380m liquidity locked, will $SLP dump immediately after farming ends? Are the holders all going to sell? What's the point of keeping $SLP in hand if it doesn't produce $RON anymore? 
Should we prepare to unstake early?"
