1,"@bobubeanfarmer @tedkimo @AzukiZen Bobu, how much have you had to drink this afternoon?"
2,13.7k followers but they couldn't get 500 people to mint until now? Hmmmm... https://t.co/VQQCeGbzSt

4,"@a1rport_eth @Pixelmon @OriginsNFT @Swarlow_ Yessss. Would love a community-driven project of this sort. And yeah, now I'm seeing mods and higher-ups in their Discord embrace Kevin's meme-y status. Ultimately not good."
5,@EKC_DAO @vohlii I LIKED THIS TWEET FOR CONSIDERATION FOR A RAFFLE FOR A DISCORD INVITE TO A TEMP SERVER WITH ANOTHER RAFFLE AND A TALENT SHOW FOR FULL DISCORD ACCESS....BIT STILL NEED SIMPLIST SOMEHOW....
6,"@a1rport_eth @Pixelmon @OriginsNFT @Swarlow_ I've had these same thoughts. Hilarious that we're taking the collective piss out of Pixelmon, but not good we're still lining their pockets. I wouldn't be surprised if they try and take advantage of the memes as well, much like an out-of-touch corporation like Walmart."
7,"Pixelmon’s Discord has become literally nothing but Kevin memes, emojis, and role play. Leave it to the NFT world to turn a slow rug into a farce. All hail Kevin. https://t.co/zfnUs2awWO"
8,We’re doomed with Pixelmon. https://t.co/FfNeVrsWsn
9,@SweetBeanDazz Yes! Got @tomislav89rs and @mikevensa on it ❤️
10,@V1Zhual I knowww. Hopefully one day we will see something from them ❤️
11,Massive respect here. I bet almost any other team would've pushed on to cash out and dip. Amazing to see a team not concerned with the $$$$ at their own expense. https://t.co/z2evNg7Tgh
12,"@humankindArt I got a WL/member role, though? Any idea what's up with that? :("
13,@am14an Glad I sold nearly all of mine sheeeesh
14,@humankindArt Is the server still open? I was in there but it has mysteriously vanished. Others have said this too. Trying to figure out what’s going on XD
15,@opt1m3 @MontyBrewsters Rain Boy Club definitely giving me bad vibes too. Seems like everyone just wants to flip it too.
16,@mor3_so A true leader. Also recently found out he used to be a comedian. Wild stuff.
17,@BlancNFT CONGRATULATIONS &lt;3

19,"The more I look at Pixelmon, the more I get upset.

Look at the OpenSea listing of one of my few remaining Pixelmon vs the Pixelmon on their experience tool. 

HOW?!? WHY?!?!? https://t.co/SNlo15p0ih"
20,@ZeroGwei @Pixelmon Do you have link to the Unity asset?

22,@WillSMONG @AzukiZen Top right and bottom left!
23,@MisterWrister The studio they’re working with is a support/studio. They don’t appear to have EVER developed a full game by themselves. I can’t believe they didn’t even bother to QC the Pixelmon that are literally missing or the dragon that is floating on its side in midair…
24,@tentilol I do think one day we will see gaming NFTs that aren’t shit…but it might take a while.
25,@Cooker_NFT @Pixelmon 💀
26,"@BrookeP51406156 EXACTLY. That's why I'm bullish on stuff like @kurorobeast where they're delaying the mint to get their game in playable shape. Games take so long to make, QA, refine, etc."
27,@eranthe_eth I wish I knew! Maybe a literal rug.

30,@J_Maverick1 Pls tell me that’s not real
31,"Got airdropped a Pixelmon while walking my dog! Thanks, Pixelmon! https://t.co/NnIse4D8RA"
32,"@J_Maverick1 To be frank, these models should’ve been finished well before the mint. These are  unfinished and/or lazy. I don’t know which one is worse."
33,"Pixelmon shows why gamers want NOTHING to do with NFTs. They raised a AAA budget and produced…this…after previewing completely different models. These look like test renderings from a game years from a release date. Gamers say NFTs are scams. And for this, I can’t disagree. https://t.co/HLntYiY7YR"

36,@ajiwagmi TY for the head's up! Hard to keep up with all this.
37,"@shanicucic96 @neotokyonewstv So much to say on this one...but my biggest question: is the game still coming? Lately, Becker has pivoted to calling NT the ""crypto Illuminati..."" huh?"

42,"@ethereumdegen Ever read Watchman? Feel like nothing short of a nearly world-ending event would come close to uniting us. But even then, that would probably be politicized in some way 😅"

Why."

54,"@Jiran_z @Suited_Aces23 Yea thanks to my frens @Impose_eth and @Sir_Dols, we've figured out it was a transfer from a custom contract. Thanks for the thorough detective work :D"
55,Credit to @youareinline for doing the detective work here
56,"Somehow this wallet got hella Tubby Cats for free right before public mint opened with a completely different contract and mint function. The wallet itself has 480 Tubby Cats...and is selling them.

Any idea what's going on here? https://t.co/IMOiXBHjyw"

68,@itsorawan So you're telling me NOT to buy into a project where the Discord admins @ everyone to DELISTTT and PUMP DA FLOOOR?

73,"@rich_degen @coffee1celatte It looks like mostly everything under $600k is condos, apartments, etc. I’m in St. Pete, which isn’t Miami crazy, but on its way there. Florida in general is absolutely mad with people flocking here."

76,@zelwart_ WE CONTROL THE FLOOR. DONT LIST BELOW 5 ETH!!!!1111
77,"@rich_degen @coffee1celatte If it’s a house, yes. I remember perusing on Zillow and asking friends in Miami about the state of the market down there, and anything remotely decent in the greater Miami area goes for at least $800k. Example here: https://t.co/mLx2UdMsYj"
78,"Transferred all my Azuki to avoid the hacker on OpenSea this weekend. After the dust settled, I transferred them right back. But now I no longer have my Twitter-approved octagon…so I guess Twitter doesn’t have a system to recheck NFT ownership? Merp."
