1,"@BlueBadger2600 I’ve seen a couple projects but haven’t gotten into them. I have one STR now and am looking for my 2nd now. I’m definitely intrigued by the idea as a whole, there are a lot of questions to be answered. Could definitely be promising, need more patience than usually given though."

5,"@SnipesNFT It takes me weeks to compile everything I need to file, imagine the already understaffed IRS trying to front-end that data collection for everyone haha. Tax code is complicated AF, they don’t have the capacity."
6,"@SnipesNFT I mean, yeah they have the basics of your W2 income. For those whose taxes are that simple that just take the standard deduction and have one income there isn’t much to it. I have multiple businesses plus crypto/NFTs and I’m married with multiple homes. My taxes are a nightmare."

75,"@LoganOP_gm @BlueBadger2600 Yeah, I assumed rural. There’s def some money in land arbitrage/wholesaling but just not sure sitting on a piece is worth the taxes unless you’re thinking prices go up to outpace the holding costs. Without some income stream from the land doesn’t seem worth it to me."
76,"@LoganOP_gm @BlueBadger2600 Haha, but why? Add in more headache and property taxes. Less upside without a plan IMO."
