Including when it’s dropped"
95,"@taLiMa_215 @BothTeamsNFT @NFTethics If you spent a day in the discord you would understand that they are very active, the team treats me better than most projects out there (they giveaway things like game tickets or jerseys every week). If you haven’t spent some time in there please stop spreading Misinformation"

98,"@CASCAD3ART @wizardofsoho @0xFablo @cerealclubnft @SakoWaves @andytreys_ @NFTethics @KB24NFT Do more research, the reason it hasn’t dropped yet is because they want to do it THE RIGHT way. 100% of proceeds going to the mamba/mambacita foundation should be sign enough for you that they are trying to be the opposite of disrespectful to Kobe"
