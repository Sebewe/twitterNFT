32,"4/ I think the challenge for this space going forward is for all of us to have the grace to allow each other to operate on a human scale: giving teams the time to build&amp;take breaks, speaking up w/in communities without every comment being an urgent demand, being thoughtful/kind."
33,"3/ in Discord be beaten back through the community's thoughtful, positive participation. Mania doesn't have to win. As a @LondonDAO contributor, every person who shares their love for the project even when the price is low, &amp; doesn't harass the team in Discord, inspires me."
34,"2/ Buying into projects you care about &amp; treating creators with respect is obvi one important way, as is resisting getting caught up in mania/dump cycles. I watched the @_veDAO_ community go through some rough stuff this week, &amp; it was amazing to see the classic bad ""dump"" vibes"
