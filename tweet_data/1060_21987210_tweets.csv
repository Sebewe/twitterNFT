43,"Why important? Because cross-pollination of GOOD projects (I.e. not just hyped 1s) via their communities and — now that there are many more projects — collabs via the project founders are some of the keys to overall NFT industry success. Rising tide raises all ships, as they say."
44,"No one talks much about how some alpha in @nbatopshot groups lead to part of the early @BoredApeYC success.

Sure there was the Clubhouse crew. The Discord diehards. But so many ppl who’d only collected Topshots crossed over into the larger NFT community via BAYC for 1st time 1/2"

46,"@pranksy Could not agree more. Having a hotbed for creativity + big ideas is amazing. But execution matters even more. We can’t just focus on great ideas, that’s what we call vapor if there’s no one in the mix that can actually execute to the high levels necessary at these $$ amounts."

The downside is, many people have great ideas, but very very few can actually execute."
49,@_waxwane Reminds me of a certain music festival 🤔
50,Also 100% this. The founders/creators are a small group. Their building will be at a specific pace. The invested holders are usually a 800-1000x larger group that can provide incredibly diverse value that the founding team could only dream of (and usually hadn’t even thought of). https://t.co/qDRfATGtTM
