16,"The article also shares some cool personal background: for example, it's pretty amazing that Tom’s parents managed to send all of their 5 children to Harvard (1st generation college grads). Looking forward to the incredible positive impact Tom &amp; Superset deliver to our ecosystem!"

25,"Wow, Apple TV series “Calls” is one of the edgiest shows I have ever watched! It’s a story told through the visual representation of phone calls among everyday couples that quickly turn chilling as they face some phenomenon. I highly recommend u watch at least the first 5 mins!"

27,The @The_OpenDAO airdrop was extremely clever - @tanayj has a good breakdown. Early DAOs operate under similar (or more extreme) dynamics to those of tech startups: you are building a plane in the air as you are dropping at 80 miles an hour. https://t.co/UBgVlnulQb

“Mothers should not be the safety net of this country.”"
