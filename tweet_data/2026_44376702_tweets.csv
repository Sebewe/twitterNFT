overview of how it compares to SAND and DCL"
98,"5/ 
Anyway here’s my reason why I think the floor is undervalued and still not too late to step in. 

I currently own NFTworlds that I bought yesterday, steep buy in price I know 🥲 but I’m bullish on @nftworldsNFT and thought I’d share why I decided to ape in."
99,"4/ 
if we compare the market cap of other metaverse tokens, SAND $3.6B, DCL $5.1B &amp; #NFTWorlds’ MC only $150M. 

The value of $WRLD is heavily undervalued, matching SAND mc, it would be at $12. Esp with 10K projects bringing their communities &amp; using their gasless built-in WRLD."
