42,@RiosREL What was their price originally?
43,"@MissLatoyaLee Hmmm .... Pharrell had multiple waves/re-invention of sounds (Neptunes, ""Happy""/""Blurred Lines"", etc.). Timbaland would have been the closest match-up (90s Timbo, 00s, Timbo, 10s Timbo) if he didn't already do it vs. Swizz. Swizz vs. Missy would have been closer too in my opinion"
