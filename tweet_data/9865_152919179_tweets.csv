88,"9/9 

Part of the proceeds will be donated to ""PROJECT LAPIS"". They support the poor but deserving pupils &amp; students in my hometown, Villasis. The founders are both respected high school teachers of my alma mater and both my best friends. 🙏😊

89,"8/9 ""EX SUPRA"" will be an ongoing @withfnd exclusive project. I will release and mint more pieces of this collection in the next months. #LFG

https://t.co/DkEcBXkAJi https://t.co/O7bXMyNa5r"
90,"7/9 And the last one, ""Stillness"" 

This pier is my go-to spot for sunrise in Christchurch. This place had a big influence on my photography journey and will always be a special place to me. 😊

https://t.co/UVxf76OOT2 https://t.co/6vt8R6N4D1"
91,"6/9 ""The Oasis"" I love this photo because of the peacefulness and ""zen vibe"" that it's giving to the viewer.

""Art should be an oasis: a place or refuge from the hardness of life."" - Fernando Botero

Taken (from a secret place) somewhere in Christchurch. 

https://t.co/Hh4mpH9HtY https://t.co/cR59aHKl1p"
92,"5/9 ""The Rising""

Originally titled ""Mt Balungao Rising"", this is one of my fave photos of all time. I lived in my hometown for about 20 plus years of my life but I have never seen the sun rising magnificently over that mountain.

93,"4/9b

If you look closer, those colorful pixels on both sides of the bridge are rubbish tossed by commuters and locals. Those dumps have been there ever since I was young. :(

This photo has won me the 2019 Sigma Amateur Photographer of the Year by D-Photo Magazine. https://t.co/MAqB4pHDom"
94,"4/9 ""Beautiful Mess"" 

A panoramic top-down shot of the bridge over Agno River, one of the largest river systems in the PH. This bridge connects my hometown and the nearby town of Rosales, going to Metro Manila.

95,"3/9 A lil intro about me... :) 

I'm Dice, a Filipino landscape, lifestyle &amp; travel photographer based in Christchurch. Born and raised in Villasis, a small town in the Philippines. I moved to the land of the long white cloud, New Zealand in 2012. https://t.co/Dcp0HMA3ro"
96,"2/9 

https://t.co/78QHQzQQlI

This collection is pretty dear to me coz it features both my home province in PH, Pangasinan &amp; my second home in NZ, Christchurch. 

These were taken from my last visit to the Philippines in 2019 before the pandemic. https://t.co/D9wXlNkEpY"
97,"1/9 Hiya fam! I'm stoked to announce that my  @withfnd  genesis 1/1 collection is now live!
