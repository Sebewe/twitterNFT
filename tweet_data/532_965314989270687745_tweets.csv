13,"@PltTiger Does Kevin need FUD? I saw people buying Kevin, and many of them had less than 50 NFTs (some less than 10) in all. Means many new-comers are buying it based on some of the hype threads (including a few by fellow Apes). Wanted to put my thoughts out there for anyone who cared"
14,@XaosBear That was the first thing that came to my mind as well ✊🇺🇦

18,"People spending 8-9 E buying Kevin. In that price you could have bought any of these:

1) 20+ RugRadio NFT
2) 12+ Robotos NFT
3) 7+ Smilessvrs NFT
4) 6+ Cool Pet NFTs
5) 1+ Cool Cat / Gutter Cat NFT
6) Multiple 1/1 pieces 

All these will give better ROI than Kevin in longer run"

40,"Hey anon - next time you shill a project, make sure you are convinced about it before shilling. Dont shill on hopium, else you go down and take down others (mostly new comers) in NFT space with you 🙏"
41,"@tothemoonfromsg @nashty_SunsFan @andy8052 @economist Quite possible. What triggered my thought was:
1. YL expanding their team and hiring blockchain devs
2. Nicole’s interview where she spoke about life beyond BAYC for YL and ‘building the road’ for Web3
3. Too much free time"
42,"@nashty_SunsFan @andy8052 @economist I am not saying they will most def do it. As others were giving their utility and hypothesis for Ape coin, I shared mine which includes building a standalone network.
Could be wrong, but I am soliciting discussions with those outright rejecting it."
43,"@nashty_SunsFan @andy8052 @economist Someone recently asked why is YL trying VC route. Could be for this.

Network effect and security - POS with ape holders as validator nodes

5B valuation is less for a built out Blockchain like Matic, not for one just starting. That potential for growth gets VC money"
44,"@nashty_SunsFan @andy8052 @economist Question is why not? Look at the limitations of current Metaverse projects. Look at the 3d models on Sandbox / DCL and compare them to Genies on Flow. If you feel you can do something better, building from scratch is never a bad option. That allows you a clean canvas"
45,@economist @andy8052 https://t.co/w5HtaYCb7z
46,"@KryptoRevivaL Running nodes doesnt need PC. You can just do that on a virtual hosted server like AWS, Vultr, Azure etc."
47,"@BrettRichey Never said that. Never meant that, and yes that is delusional. But Elon is someone who has been striving for energy efficient crypto, so it is possible that a startup gives him an elevator pitch to him on a new initiative they are doing - that is what I meant"
48,"@nairb621 @Ape7068 Yes, agree - only time will tell 😊 End of the day, we are all keyboard warriors, debating and speculating 💙"
49,@economist @andy8052 Is it? Tell me with genuine data points on why that is wild. Always up for a good discussion
50,"@andy8052 @economist That was me, and I strongly believe YL are creating more than a coin. A blockchain to create an entertainment based ecosystem is not a stretch. Dapperlabs created flow after cryptokitties. I am not laying out the possibilities, doesnt have to be true. You dont agree, no prob 🙏"
51,@nairb621 @Ape7068 They have partnership with horizen labs. But I don’t remember seeing any statement that they build everything YL with Horizen
52,RT @VitalikButerin: Getting some confirmations from a couple sources that it's legit. Deleting my warning for now. But continue to be vigil…
53,"@banterlytics @MutantShopkeep Rather than make a statement like this, I suggest you re-read what I have said and ask questions if you don’t understand."
54,"@MutantShopkeep Yes, there is a huge difference. Thats why Bitcoin, Litecoin etc are coins but Matic, Uni etc. are tokens. Tokens are native of Ethereum blockchain while coins are independent blockchain"
55,@nftcrypto3 Yes they are
56,"@LinusCaldwell5 @0x_fxnction @Hm0n3yy @ape_g4ng @yugalabs That said, YL (if they choose to) can decide to give some portion of holdings of YL to ApeDAO. That will increase the valuation of the DAO. If so, the DAO will be the intersection between token and YL in a venn diagram"
57,"@LinusCaldwell5 @0x_fxnction @Hm0n3yy @ape_g4ng @yugalabs You both are right as you are talking about 2 different things.

Tokens will be for Ape DAO. Ape DAO will gets benefits from YugaLabs and Ape ecosystem, which will give value to the DAO

YugaLabs as an entity can choose to go VC route (or even Public) for growing beyond BAYC"
58,@marshall_eth 1 MFER = 1 MFER. Thats the only reality. Rest all speculation
59,"@osf_nft If you see the interview by Nicole, she talks about building the road for Web3. Road = New Network?"
60,@nftbhai Oh - 🙈
61,@nftgerry I see what you did there 🤓
62,"@jimbochewdip I am speculating YL could bring a new blockchain or a new L2 solution, not just use an existing network to launch their coin. I am speculating something much bigger than just a coin and a P2E game"
63,"Could also be a new ETH L2 network and not an independent network. Could that explain Moonpay’s meeting with Elon? Coz Elon supports energy efficient crypto. Could be nothing, could be something. I am just speculating so I can quote tweet &amp; appear smart if this happens - DYOR 🥷"
64,"So hear me out:
- What if $Ape coin is not a ERC-20 token?
- What if it is a stand alone coin on a POS blockchain?
- What if this blockchain powers YL ecosystem?
-What if the Ape holders (BAYC, MAYC, BAKC) work as validator nodes to secure the network with tiered staking rewards?"

67,@osf_nft 3 ETH mint. This is a literal FU to the NFT community and how easy it is to fool us collectively. And these are kind of things mainstream media likes to highlight on how NFTs are scam
68,@goodmontheth Awesome set 🌈👓🌈
69,OpenSea is migrating the listings and hence there is a 50% drop in listings across the board. Dont FOMO buy and get REKT - DYOR.
70,"@nftgerry Wait, what? SMH"
71,@BalouBAYC Right? Worth noting that projects at absolute bottom with no price action are doing some of the coolest stuff in this space. And respect for such teams that push the space forward despite not making money and riding only on passion!

75,"I like how @BlazedCats is innovating in NFT space. Their listings in OS have:
1. Quantum Metadata (multiple Avatars to choose from) 
2. Says if the companion drop has been claimed on the image itself

This should be a default feature for projects doing companion drop. Kudos💙"

78,"This is not Elon, a guy with his kind of net-worth doesnt need to flex with a Gold Ape. But wont be surprised if he puts this as his PFP just to troll all the Apes claiming this to be Elon just because there was a picture of him and Moonpay CEO outside an elevator https://t.co/nkgcrmCH70"

86,"(4/4)

I am at a negative ROI with these projects. Some of them will survive in long run, some wont -  but I am proud of being part of each one of them. 

This 🧵is an appreciation post for all creators &amp; builders who have been creating silently despite no price action. Much 💙"
87,"(3/4)

@theEthereans - I am not aware of any other project that has built faster than them - from 3d models to gaming to metaverse AVIs
@ethlings - A project much ahead of their time, bringing in customizable NFTs and artist collaborations, only to be slow-rugged by the creators"
88,"(2/4)

@TheMonsterRehab - Kevin (@Metaciple) and team grinding their way through to create an awesome graphic novel and TV series
@hiddeninoise -  Two awesome artists bringing maths &amp; randomness together to create a fascinating AV NFT &amp; incorporating them to IRL performances"
89,"🧵on projects that I have held &amp; am proud of, even though floor action has been absent:

@TheAlienBoyNFT - Because Georgie &amp; team, fockers never give up irrespective of price action
@GlueFactoryShow - Accomplished writers and creators making a TV show &amp; helping horses IRL

91,@greatmando_nft I missed it - you said volumes. I am in agreement
92,"@greatmando_nft 500 billion in sales or valuation? If valuation, then it is a very conservative number. NFT as a technical intervention will proliferate many more industries- retail, real estate, entertainment and many more. 5x of that by 2030 is my guesstimate"

94,@greatmando_nft @KeyboardMonkey3 Some good scotch and a fully charged phone I guess 😊
95,"@osf_nft @Sothebys With ETH prices being low, I feel 5k E is a good deal for a long term investor / collector (counting on LL not taking any further mis-steps)"
96,"@osf_nft @Sothebys I feel we see the final sale price at 5000 - 6000 E. In which case, no impact to the market. Significantly lower than 5k triggers a short bearish cycle of 2-3 weeks"
97,"@steven_schill Interestingly, seems this Invisible Friend is not part of their collection and a special collection. Have mixed feelings on that. Why not include this as a 1/1 as part of the main collection."
98,The biggest risk to Web3 start-ups is greed and trying to get rich overnight. Moral and ethical lines get blurred when people try to justify things through monetary gains. The projects that do things in the right way will be the real long term winners in this space
99,@greatmando_nft @BoredApeYC The art detail and quality is through the roof
