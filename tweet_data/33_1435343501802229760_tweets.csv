8,"@GencoLaw My point is discovering some accounts had all the rares ones collected which are rare and sold it. Given I bought hundreds of punk average 110eth + which made the punk as it is today, why all the criticism ? lol"
9,"@ACthecollector Just shocked someone had all these collections and that's just my reaction, then I see is him, since I was trying to buy his ape punk before but one 1day late, and he is cool with the tweet too, we talk about many things. Punk would not be this price if I did not buy hundreds"

Their CTO reach out to me to help with the incident they had a couple days ago too. I m really trying to help🤣"
41,"@JulienvDorland @opensea and investing in the education of users is always better off strategy. like how uniswap have millions of fake tokens, but no one really falls for it. NFT exist because we want freedom, own our assets, but now we are back to square 0 with a 99% centralized NFT exchange in control"
42,"@JulienvDorland @opensea I agree that its purpose is to protect buyers from fake collections, but if they decide this in a centralized manner, then they should compensate those victims of it because they failed to do their job. or they could let user vote on which collection should get the bluemark."

54,"Personally, I used @gemxyz more than Opensea already, I totally spend over 3000ETH on gem already, I love their product and how fast and smooth their team delivers products, sadly I was not able to invest in them. So this is not a shill post for them lol."
55,"This is why personally I do not intend to join an NFT platform war where I know at least 20+ very promising teams are working on making the next Opensea competition. But with 0 fees, NFT platforms will rely on curated fees and advertisements sooner or later."
56,"Within 1 year 95+% day trading volume will be with @gemxyz 
Where @opensea will still capture the ART(1/1) /collectables and casual buyers. 

There will be a marketplace with 0 fees integrated to GEM and results in most listings/trades will be patched through a 0% fee market."
57,"Imagine an NFT trader listing with @gemxyz on all platforms, buying and selling all through NFT aggregator, where aggregator choose the cheapest fee route possible to facilitate the transactions."
58,"This is a huge difference if you think @gemxyz will be similar to @1inch, you are wrong!
NFT aggregator sites like @gemxyz will be bigger than @opensea / @LooksRareNFT and all marketplaces. 
Unlike @1inch are very hard to be bigger than @Uniswap"
59,"NFT liquidity is listings and WETH offers. Where 1 NFT can be listed across all platforms and provide liquidity across all NFT platforms, as well as WETH offers are able to offer to all NFT platforms."
60,"My prediction of NFT marketplaces, what they will be like in the next couple of quarters/years?
First, you have to understand NFT liquidity is very different from token liquidity. 
ERC token liquidity provided on @SushiSwap  won't be able to use on @Uniswap (long thread)"
