84,"@WilhelmTell3675 @nicksdjohnson Also, adding some form of 2FA for ens accounts to become a verified buyer."
85,"@WilhelmTell3675 @nicksdjohnson I assume it would a fairly easy task/program to see amount of transactions on etherscan / date of account created / etc. For the lottery I was thinking you'd pay the gas on entry when the expiration day comes. Perhaps there is a week/month window to purchase entry to the ""lotto"""
86,"@WilhelmTell3675 @nicksdjohnson Note above I said that there would need to be wallet analysis and a team to handle that, to make sure that these wallets are indeed active and legit."
87,@nicksdjohnson I have many many ideas surrounding this.. I would love to form a team to address this issue. @futurealisha
88,"@nicksdjohnson I believe adding a ""watchlist"" to certain ens names and giving it a lottery is potentially the best solution.. leave it to chance... I'm sure there is potential for user-analysis/wallet analysis, I'm certain there is a team that could be formed to handle this."
89,"@nicksdjohnson I believe there needs is a more intuitive solution around this issue, ENS is growing at absurd rates. It is important to reduce the bot-sweeps on expired names - I think adding a Captcha (not amazing solution) to checkout is necessary."
90,"@nicksdjohnson This does nothing but expand on the problem. You want to reduce sniping but then exclusively give power to those with the capital to do so..

You say you don't want ENS domains to be squatted on yet, slapping absurd prices like this only encourages it."
