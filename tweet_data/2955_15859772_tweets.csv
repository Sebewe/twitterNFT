25,@Dogetoshi Wrong. They spent millions for you to be talking about them today.
26,@BitBitCrypto It's more about making into mainstream pop culture.
27,@ChibiLabs Love mine
28,@crysyphus No
29,@Razultull @JackNiewold The nasdaq traded down immediately on the Ukraine news.  You have think that crypto markets are  trading in lock step to risk off assets.

39,@GordoDrake @Brianaverse @NFtSNiPERbOt @BlokchainBull @Crypto__Chicks This is our scammer.  It popped back up in my messages I guess because he used the same email for the account. We should put him on blast. https://t.co/GovxUVZt01

41,@Route2FI @Route2FI I would love to know what your farming strategy would be for a hypothetical multiple 7 figures.
42,@OnetimeCC @Route2FI Are you just buying and staking LQDR?  Not in any of their pools?
43,@BulmanCD @Route2FI What are you staking here?  Everyone always says LQDR but not sure what pair to stake.
44,@AviAisenberg @lionsmilk_eth @BoredApeYC Any idea where they got them printed?  I like that look a lot.
45,"@GordoDrake @Brianaverse @NFtSNiPERbOt @BlokchainBull @Crypto__Chicks Just sent you a Chibi Galaxy.  Sorry, quite the ordeal."
46,@GordoDrake @Brianaverse @NFtSNiPERbOt @BlokchainBull @Crypto__Chicks He reached out to me a couple hours before you did.  Sucks because I sent them a chibi galaxy plus more.
47,"@BlokchainBull @GordoDrake @Brianaverse @NFtSNiPERbOt @Crypto__Chicks All good what happens. I just missed the L in the middle of the handle.  Crazy how many scammers there are out there on CT.  I didn't even think twice as I was just trying to make it right, until it was too late."
48,"@GordoDrake @Brianaverse @NFtSNiPERbOt @BlokchainBull @Crypto__Chicks Don't even ask there was a scammer that took your name and I sent 3 NFTs to.  Not your fault I should have caught it, but just letting you know what happened here after I reached out for your wallet.

His name was @GordolDrake and it was too late by the time we realized it. https://t.co/mUYjPfRzYR"

50,@harryyeh @tombfinance @_2omb @CTAvenue @This_Is_Risky A pyramid might not have been the best visual choice for this partnership.  Just saying :)
51,@Route2FI @Route2FI would love to see a thread on any projects that give you back either the L1 token as yield or a pairing of reward tokens that aren’t just the gov token of the project.  Just not many beside anchor and $looks which gives you $weth back.
52,"@AnthunBj @indoexJKT @milesdeutscher @harryyeh Look all I want is what's best for the tomb ecosystem, so hopefully all these decisions are in that vain."
53,"@AnthunBj @indoexJKT @milesdeutscher @harryyeh I mean it was a little messed up you have to admit.  I stayed clear because he called it a rug for then him to what I was buy 2omb, announce a partnership, and sell?"
54,"@GordoDrake I know the team already sent you bunch of NFTs, but if you DM me your wallet I would like to send you more."
55,"@Brianaverse @Nftdee2 @Crypto__Chicks @MichaelKdcl @NFtSNiPERbOt @ChibiLabs @SEECRITS @GordoDrake We're on spaces spending time, giving advice/support to creators and giving them an audience to pitch their projects.  On top of that, we're giving away real value  NFTs to the listeners.  We're all learning and we'll make sure to make it right for last night and going forward."
56,"@GordoDrake @Crypto__Chicks @GordoDrake, please DM your wallet address."
57,@GordoDrake @Crypto__Chicks I'm sorry that happened to you @GordoDrake.  I'll talk to @NFtSNiPERbOt and we'll make it right.  Stay tuned!
58,@Nftdee2 @GordoDrake @Crypto__Chicks I don't think it was like that at all.  We're completely impartial to who the winner is.
59,"@CryptoBKAY The problem is there seems to be a lot of sell pressure on $FTM and as much as I would like it to be, clearly TVL doesn't equate to increased market-cap."

65,@Sohaib___Khan @milesdeutscher This is part of the problem with the $TOMB you would rather play the arbitrage than buy $TBOND.
66,"@milesdeutscher There needs to be better $TBOND mechanisms/incentives in place so we're all not relying on @harryyeh to bring us back over peg.  I think I'm going to write a thread on my ideas for $TBOND tokenomics, as I don't think they're right currently."
