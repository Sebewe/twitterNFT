0,Been learning solidity for a while now and want to start actually building something. Anyone need a dev/have any project ideas?
1,"Not having a roadmap doesn't mean the founders plan on sitting back and doing nothing for the project, but rather means the people buying in are buying for the community and art. It keeps expectations low and establishes a much healthier floor price and community"

3,@timm_eth @CountofZurich @LTCFAN1 Ya so they are basically saying they just sent u 43 eth 1st and was expecting u to send an nft back? Doesn’t really make any sense and the thread is poorly worded. Not jumping to conclusions but doesn’t seem really liable
4,@M1Wizard Same. NFTs have consumed all my time 😂
5,@M1Wizard 100% agree
6,Can we really blame traditional gamers for hating NFTs when they see things like Pixelmon raise 70 million at a $10k mint price when games like Elden Ring are $60 lol. NFT tech is great but we have a long ways to go before NFT gaming is taken seriously

28,I'm starting to like projects that have no specific roadmap at the time of mint. Most of these roadmaps are nonsense anyways and just lead to let downs and the collection dying. Letting the community grow organically and keeping expectations low is the best way imo

33,@Grove_x3 @sen_eth @crypto888crypto Definitely didn’t agree with the mint price. NFT community held them accountable and they made the necessary adjustments. No one is forcing anyone to buy or burn. Totally up to the market and with the DA floor removed the people will decide what it’s worth
34,@zachxbt Ahh I was misinformed on that point. Either way happy to see the nft community holding creators accountable and then creators receiving the criticism and making the necessary changes
35,@zachxbt Fair. But with the dutch auction floor removed the market will decide. I just think the hate towards 888 on this project isn’t justifiable as the price was set by BT and gala games. And then taking the steps to protect 888 token holders from potential losses also speaks volumes

65,@HelloFarmerJoe @LooksRareNFT Agreed. Any platform that rewards its users instead of pocketing the fees for themselves is 👌 in my book

69,@luxr0yal @defidami @LooksRareNFT Ya I did at around $2.90ish
70,@defidami @LooksRareNFT 100%. I sold ahead thinking it was for sure gonna dump after the rewards but this changes everything
71,Looks like $LOOKS rewards are distributed over 24 hours instead of all at once to prevent dumping. Genius move by the @LooksRareNFT devs. Price has gone from $2.50 to about $3.20 in a matter of minutes after people realized
72,@artdaddy_eth @LooksRareNFT Especially considering how much of the total supply is in volume rewards https://t.co/n6NJ89Xbrk
73,@artdaddy_eth @LooksRareNFT ya this could very easily blow up the price of $LOOKS in the short term if they don't fix it. Will probably look at selling before the rewards are released
74,@TakenByHyume @LooksRareNFT people are doing a lot of fake sales to themselves to earn a ton of rewards in $LOOKS (which is based off your trading volume) so that they can dump when the rewards are released in under 4 hours. i.e. selling a meebit to themselves for 100 eth back and forth over and over again
75,"With all the wash trading going on @LooksRareNFT and trading rewards being paid out in $LOOKS, will this not crash the price when rewards are released in a little under 4 hours?"
