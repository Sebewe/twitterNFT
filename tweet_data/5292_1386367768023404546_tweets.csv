9,@NathanHeadPhoto Lol same. What happened with Mories on OS still makes me bullish long term on the platform and they continue to work and add more features. Might as well continue to stake what I have at this point and see where it goes.

42,@jhovNFT @coolcatsnft Hatching your pet will allow you to earn extra milk AND items from quests which can be sold for more milk or kept for future utility. If there end up being quest exclusive items those could go for a premium also.

Is the price sustainable? How does $MILK even work?

44,@underoath72 @cr0ssETH https://t.co/CprU6VX20L That's the daily distribution for cats. For pets milk is earned by running quests.

48,Ayyyeee LFG!! @nbatopshot https://t.co/KzcAJ93Lbi
49,I think it would be real interesting to see 1/1 cats get a special plot of land also that matches the traits of their cat. I could see the potential of them holding their own community events there if they wanted. I know I would want to go visit.
50,I would love to see this. Maybe that could be a perk for higher tier cats. Higher rarity cats get larger plots of land? Hmm @coolcatsnft 👀 https://t.co/wnKS0ll9da

53,@NudeCurtis Yea same. I honestly don’t care atm that the team has taken some profits either. Keeping in mind the alternative is OS where they have been taking all those profits since since the beginning. I don’t think most people would care either if the token price was up.
54,"$LOOKS Tokenomics FUD aside, the fees are still lower than OS and buying and selling still comes with more rewards than nothing. I would prefer to use #looksrare just on those fact alone."

70,@sighduck I think it will be interesting to see over time how many holders are looking for passive milk and exclusively plan to stake vs those who plan to run quests with as many pets as they have time for especially as more p2e projects release.
71,@sighduck I’m also interested to see how the Guild works. Any predictions on the percentage of milk the owners will keep after renting pets out?

78,@MopStuff @sighduck I think in the short term we see a premium for final form pets over unhatched eggs. Long term I see that being flipped depending on how many 1/1 pets have been revealed.
79,@sighduck I see a lot of people saying they want to buy a pet after the post-reveal dip. Still quite a few that don’t understand they dynamics and how cool the pets are actually going to end up being.
