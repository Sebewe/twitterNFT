9,@OzTheApe So true! June of 2010 I registered my account. Hardly ever touched it until June 2021. 11 damn years.

60,@Monerodinero @dfinzer It’s that simple really. People then become trained that the only communication they will receive from these platforms is directly from the app or DT UI. I don’t understand the behavior of them still. https://t.co/GKMhvCiSMR
61,@dfinzer One thing Opensea could do is stop communicating with members via email. This is web 2 archaic behavior. Create a freaking messaging service on the platform that pushes notifications through app. Duhhh?!? Get smart open sea !
62,@zofrus Check out @ThePigeonSocial - great little charity nft project.
63,"My @0xApes_NFT was feeling lonely, so I aped into a great charity NFT that funds education for children in need. Can I get my #0xapes family to look into this project for me?

91,@DegenSoul @0xApes_NFT Ok so can you come play with some of apes over at @ThePigeonSocial please now and thank you. Charity project with cool art just getting started. Great entry right now. You can degen  there with me.
92,"@bullish_cowboy @0xApes_NFT Honestly, look at @ThePigeonSocial  - it’s mostly a charity nft but the community is cool and the creator is genuine. Myself and several other apes have joined. A few ETH could go a long way for the education of these children. Check out my Twitter for the full story."
93,21/ @ThePigeonSocial  Discord:  https://t.co/Ke97Y4kD3B https://t.co/OX04JAc9ih
94,"20/ Welcome everyone, and do not forget to have fun. You should never feel the pressure of losing, especially from a free mint. It all depends how long you can HODL on the Pigeon Flight!!
#PigeonPosse join the discord and come take flight with us. #NFTs"
95,19/  I will never promise you anything that I cannot achieve. First we need to build our budget and then we can board the space flight to the Moon.
96,"18/ We will together finish our charity sponsoring process and in the end, original Art will prevail. NFTs are about Art and entertainment, and this is what we will achieve. All together.

The next steps in the Pigeon flight will be quite exciting."
97,"17/ And that, was finally the start of the adventure. You guys are all part of the adventure now. This has now become YOUR project. You are all shareholders and together, we will carry on proving to the NFT Space that their approach has become completely wrong."
98,"16/ So a couple of days ago, we launched. Again.
We sold about 4.5k in the first 3 days. I had no idea that @Monster and @3hippies had even tweeted about it!! But when I found out, half a day later, 5k NFTs were minted in 56 minutes (to be exact)."
99,"15/ These charities are known to us for their work, and we know where the funding goes. They are GENUINE!!"
