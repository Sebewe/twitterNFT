11,@MiA_Will Oh no Michelle!!! Look after yourself 😬
12,@Ben_Longstaff @arcade_nfts So would you say that’s like Metaverse/gaming with embedded financial incentives? Interesting to think about where these categories merge for sure!
13,@NFTashie @c0c0_nfts @CryptoVenus_NFT Oooh that’s a goodie!!

16,"A great thread from @kagami_nft on NFT staking if this is a new concept for you! 

https://t.co/eCtFj3scDL https://t.co/OcQHrOUdJN"
17,"@batkomichael Oh so just the reminder not the service haha, I read too fast. I reckon the king of productivity can find another way around that! ;)"
18,@batkomichael Why cancelled???
19,* Disclaimer that I hold NFTs in many of the collections mentioned above but these are just examples not recommendations!
20,"What else are you seeing? Would love to hear of other projects that fit into the above categories, or if there are features/ whole groupings that I'm missing."
21,"Causes/ A super powerful opp, but seems to be common inclusion in roadmaps today to bolster projects that are otherwise a bit liteweight. Donations to charities/ projects with an emphasis on social causes I like: @FlowerGirlsNFT @alphagirlclub @WomenriseNFT 

What have I missed?"
22,"Metaverse/ For most collections, this is *the point*. World-building, lore, gaming extensions, 3D avatars, metaverse land ownership - it's early days of what this will look like with projects like @crypto_coven @WoodiesNFT @SappySealsNFT @nftworldsNFT"
23,"Financial &amp; Agency Incentives/ For me this is where NFTs become really interesting - features like licensing rights, royalties on collection profits, investment clubs (@WoWPixiesNFT), staking (@SappySealsNFT), lending (@meta_angels)  and eventual #DAO formation (@worldofwomennft)"
24,"Status &amp; Assets/ An extension of being part of community, many NFT collections are shaping up to be 21stC decentralised brands w real-world merch, exclusive airdrops, collectibles marketplaces, and token-gated education opps. eg @creatureNFT @AzukiZen @alphagirlclub @RTFKTstudios"
25,"Community/ Within and beyond the Discord servers, Community features include social clubs, real-world art experiences (eg. gallery shows), IRL events and even physical space ownership. @BoredApeYC @worldofwomennft have set precedents here."
26,"The Art/ The obvious place to start, many roadmaps include 'Season 2+' reveals, art extensions on the original or companion art, mint access for related collections and even new art collecting on behalf of holders. Most projects will have some plans for this at a minimum."
27,"NFT roadmap features seem to fall into about 6 core groups of features before they start to become variations on a theme: The Art, Community, Status &amp; Assets, Financial/ Agency Incentives, Metaverse and Causes."
28,"Caveating this thread with the fact that I think great #web3 #NFT projects can be about the art and art alone! (inc 10k or similar collections), but I got curious about the various roadmap features used across most major projects. A 🧵."
29,@tiffatronn I think we’re on the only dry patch in noosa!! Hope it eases from today before it does too much damage in the community 😢
