69,@BOObotcher @RTFKTstudios thanks. the best NFT investment so far
70,@MetaFleek_ @RTFKTstudios 🤣
71,@InverseDump @RTFKTstudios if you getting early you can pay 1-2 ETH (sometimes even less) to mint... but gotta get in early
72,@klonmaximalist @RTFKTstudios hahahah.... guess it is part of the process of making it an even stronger community but looking forward to the reveal
73,@NekozTek @RTFKTstudios yes it is
74,"@woland_dr @RTFKTstudios bought a lot 😅. you can check my profile to see what i have. i normally use Opensea to buy NFTs. My biggest sources to find good projects are Twitter, Discord channels and youtube. after that i do my own research to decide what to buy"
75,@coolfacenoa @RTFKTstudios yes ser
76,@CryptoT90 @RTFKTstudios get on the #clonefollowclone groups!
77,@ColeBaron83 @RTFKTstudios nice collection! see you are a Divine fan like me!
78,@SoleCollectorTS @RTFKTstudios you guys are getting me pumped. need to hide my ledger 🤣
79,@19baker @RTFKTstudios nice! outside my price range 😅.
80,@Cookin_Jx @RTFKTstudios was not expecting things to go crazy so early ... we made the right choice.  this project is awesome
81,not trying to be offensive to any other community  but have been involved in many bluechip projects and never felt this sense of community like the @RTFKTstudios fam. as evidence my twitter acct (the NFT one) went from like 200 to over a 1000 right after i joined it. Respect Fam.
82,@eternal_tl @RTFKTstudios dont blame ya. nice!
83,@handmadepuzzles @RTFKTstudios need to start somewhere. i was lucky to get into crypto 2 years ago and it was a life changer.  end of last year started to move some of the gains into NFTs- also here lots of gains to be made. the only problem is that i get too attached to them and have a tough taking profits 🤣
84,@J_JamesNeutron @RTFKTstudios tempting but need to add 1 🤣 otherwise will still be in the same situation
85,@toocoolhape @HAPEsocial @DigimentalLDN yes ser! https://t.co/VKZmVO5fkf

87,@Alts_Anonymous @RTFKTstudios yeap. know the feeling

94,"@4n6_nerd @RTFKTstudios yeah, 9 feels like something is missing. i might need to re-arrange my portfolio to accommodate that."
