6,Feel like we are going to be seeing new @tokenfy_ launches every day now. The art on these look top notch https://t.co/CrQzOZMOTy
7,Historic moment! @paschamo was the first NFT artist to launch their own smart contract on @tokenfy and his first NFT is now available for sale on @opensea. #tokenfy $tknfy https://t.co/5gWwJZXWbX

9,Can't wait to see what projects are launching on @tokenfy_ https://t.co/wEMChTLhnU
10,@GutterCatGang @epicthundercat 🚀
11,No excuses to keep using the @opensea shared contract. Use @tokenfy_ or another no-code solution to launch your NFT projects. Own your contract = own your future https://t.co/Ev8XZfUTvH
12,@ETHMUPPET @opensea @tokenfy_ is another great option where you own your own contract and can launch NFT projects in minutes with no coding

17,@dragonseller88 @tokenfy_ is launching a few-click solution for creators to migrate to their own smart contracts from the OS shared contract. Also the app should be live within a week or two for anyone to launch their own smart contract and mint/drop site

22,"@ABigThingBadly @Bcpaintball26 @Centrartz Web 3.0 blurs the lines between creators and collectors. In a few years, most people will have launched a smart contract and NFT collection. Tokenfy will make that as easy as possible and abstract away all of the technical stuff behind the scenes. So easy a grandma can do it!"

25,@Centrartz @ABigThingBadly Tons of cool features coming soon! The team is working on an elegant few-click solution for creators on the OS shared contract to launch a new collection on their own contract and collectors can burn their old NFTs and mint new ones in the new collections
26,"@ABigThingBadly @ammojr87 @grantpat sTKNFY is currently worth like 1.6 TKNFY or something so when you unstake it, you get your original amount back plus your rewards (click on the unstake button to see the calculations)"
27,@KingBlackBored A tech company in which all low level employees shared in decision making would get smoked by a tech company led by a small team of experienced executives 999 times out of 1000
28,@KingBlackBored 💯. Experienced operators dedicated to working hard for community benefit is the way. 80/20 principle in action (more like 99/1).
29,@danielgothits @ABigThingBadly Also working on a solution for people on the OS shared contract to migrate over to their own contract in a few clicks 👀
30,"@Bcpaintball26 @ABigThingBadly Yeah that feature will be huge. Once there are a large number of $TKNFY holders, if a creator gives the option for collectors to mint their NFTs for ETH or $TKNFY there will be a massive number of @tokenfy_ holders that mint and sell out the project"

33,"I got word that within a week, smaller artists will be able to launch contracts/collections w/ a few clicks and then sell their NFTs on any marketplace. For the first few weeks it will be virtually free so it will be a no brainer for artists to migrate off the OS shared contract https://t.co/FWz5u8uCkY"

35,@3dm0nd87 @tokenfy_ Right now LP token staking has higher APR b/c less people are doing it. 500k tokens per day being distributed to LP token stakers and there aren't too many wallets sharing in these rewards
