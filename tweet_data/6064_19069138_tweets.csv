1,@AJT_Kicks @blazecamp_ @JungleBayAC Clean one.  Nice!
2,@DougieFreshNFT @JungleBayAC @blazecamp_ Classic!
3,@ArenasVFX @aleph0ne @ApeRaffle How does it work?   And when is the raffle?
4,@LukieMotion @JungleBayAC Excellent recap.  Well said!!!
5,"Very cool recap on the history of @JungleBayAC.  100% Community DAO, Treasury and IP rights to all holders.  All Royalties go into the DAO Treasury and all holders vote on what comes next in the roadmap.  Very cool concept and community. https://t.co/S3u2YW8KEP"
6,@DougieFreshNFT @JungleBayAC @_iSKYLiNE_ That’s very cool.  Glad you were taken care of.   Just be careful out there with your wallet.  Not every Mint is safe and watch out for email phishing scams.  All of us learn the hard way at one time or another.
7,@aleph0ne @JungleBayAC Thank you taking time to join the discord and doing your own research.  I also have a better understanding of your point and have a lot of respect for what you are saying.   Hope you appreciate our POV as well.  Thank you again.  Cheers.
8,"@aleph0ne @JungleBayAC Fact check.  100% of the mint and royalties goes to the Community DAO and Treasury.  Unlike most other projects, the Founders only received 1 Legendary each for their work. Nothing else.  No profits. And this was all put to a DAO vote prior to Mint."
9,"@aleph0ne @JungleBayAC Unfortunately, many of us have been rug pulled before.  This project @JungleBayAC came about by members from that community coming together and decided to do something about it.   Core team worked day and night to create something and were never paid.   This was their reward. https://t.co/sY0bKpKUY0"
