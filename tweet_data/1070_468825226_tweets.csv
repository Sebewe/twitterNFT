69,"⚠️ Be careful

You can be scammed in every walk of life &amp; you should be as careful as ever here

Trying to write off NFTs as scams while banks are too big to fail &amp; a % of stock brokers are Bernie Madoff, is laughable

But please just be protective of your assets &amp; your mind!"
70,"🛠 Utility

This was a bonus for me early on but has become important for my list

NFT PFP utility is king imo and that’s what people are looking for most. 1/1 Art typically doesn’t need utility

More utility = more ways to benefit from the project which means more reason to HODL"
71,"💸 Affordability

This is relative depending on your situation, but if the mint price is out of my comfort zone then I’ll patiently watch from sidelines

I still want to profit &amp; high prices remove that possibility, plus most teams don’t need as much $ as they’re charging"
72,"👨‍👩‍👦 Founders

The best way to avoid being rugged is buying into doxxed or at least experienced ppl with a track record

This is especially difficult in a space where people like anonymity/privacy

I avoid projects who don’t even link to their team or all accounts created recently"
73,"🏃‍♂️Longevity/Community

The way I look at this has changed, but essentially the more talk about !floor &amp; prices in the community, the less they typically care about the project

Again if you’re not buying just for art, there should be some roadmap or plan for continuity after mint"
74,"🎨 Art

If the art is something you don’t prefer, consider not buying

If it’s not your favorite, but still has big utility then that may outshine what it looks like 

But I start with art first &amp; prefer collections that resonate with me

I still want to buy things that look good"
75,"🧵It’s getting harder than ever to distinguish good projects from bad at mint
