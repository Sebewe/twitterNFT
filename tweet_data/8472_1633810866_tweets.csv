13,@ClayWeier Do you ever call a group of men “males”? It’s so strange to me “females” lol
14,"Imagine if you abandon your work before it’s finished. 

Yes, in the process, you’ll likely have doubts… 

But quitting doesn’t bring you the end result. https://t.co/JSmpJUR358"
15,"I understand that, in the majority, female/woman and male/man are one in the same. 

I just find this discrepancy odd."
16,"Quick Q:

Why is it that calling women “females” is normal? 

When was the last time you heard someone refer to a man as a “male”? Or make generalities/jokes about “males”?"

30,"The only person who can do your emotional healing for you … is you. 

Being dependent on others, or holding expectations of how others should or shouldn’t perform around you in order to facilitate your healing takes your power away. 

You have agency. You have ownership. ❤️"
31,@kashviETH NOICE 😂😂
32,"Okay I am sure there are more - but this is what I could think of today 💭 

Also my DMs are always open. 

ALWAYS!"
33,"Or else it means “we didn’t love them” 💕 or some other goofy thing

That’s bullshit! 

You are a human with a range of emotions and capacities. 

Sadness, anger, frustration are predominant in grief - but don’t limit yourself when you feel a moment of joy peeking through"
34,"8) Allow yourself to smile 😊 and laugh 

Grieving is an odd process that’s different for everyone … 

But I’ve noticed we put this pressure on ourselves that EVERY minute we must be sobbing 😭"
35,"7) FEEL your feelings. The longer you run away from them, the longer they stick around. 

They’ll keep knocking on your door 🚪 but will get louder and more forceful until you invite them in and hear them out."
36,"Whatever decisions that are made, your loved 🥰 one will be happy with. 

Please don’t put too much pressure on yourself. 

And PLEASE don’t let the funeral homes pressure you into buying the “most expensive” options just because “that’s what they deserve”"
37,"6) Planning a funeral is stressful like planning a wedding - except the “happy stress” is “sad stress” 

And you get ZERO notice, pretty much 

Remember this: Funerals are for the living. It’s for our moment of closure or honor."
38,"Also, you don’t have to rush this process! Take the time you need. 

If someone is pressing you on it, show them this tweet 🐣 and say 

“MORGAN said I don’t have to rush!”"
39,"5) When you start cleaning 🧹 out belongings, I recommend purchasing a really nice box 📦 

The one I have for my mom is a beautiful leather trunk 

Store your most treasured items and memories there to look back on"
40,"You don’t have to reply to each and every Facebook post and comment and message. 

You don’t have to entertain, perform, or put on for anyone. 

Give yourself freedom and room to be in control of what you can in that moment. ❤️"
41,"4) Put the phone 📞 away if you need to. 

Yes, everyone who cares about you will call, text, FB you, whatever. 

They are coming from a very loving place! But your healing is priority. 

You don’t owe anyone anything. 

You don’t have to answer every phone call"
42,"P.S. If it was not LITERALLY your fault, then it is not your fault. 

Allow yourself forgiveness. Love yourself. Forgive yourself."
43,"3) Guilt is a really exhausting - and useless emotion unless you see what’s under it. 

Dig into that guilt. What lesson is it trying to teach you? Is that misplaced guilt coming from a high standard or expectation that you can remove yourself from … to get relief?"
44,"…Trust me on this one. When my mom died, I ate what my emotions were telling me to eat for 6 months straight. 

I gained over 50 pounds and that made me feel even worse because I didn’t recognize myself anymore. 

Not to mention I was always tired.."
45,"2) The comfort food, the sugar. That is only temporary… Your body needs high quality fuel even more so when you’re drained. 

Try some protein and filling fats first before reaching for the comfort food."
46,"1) You’ve already lost someone you dearly love. It sucks! But you don’t have to lose yourself in the process. 

Take a shower, get dressed, exercise, cook. Do your routines even when it’s hard. ❤️"
47,"It does take some energy and effort to do these things, but I’ve done it both ways. 

Dragging yourself out of bed 🛌 or peeling yourself off the couch 🛋 is worth it for your mental health and healing ❤️‍🩹"
