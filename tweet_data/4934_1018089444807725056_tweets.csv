1,@mikedemarais Bro what’s up with this? https://t.co/dU8g1McnVv
2,"@renftlabs @jpeg_dealer420 Awesome, thank you so much! :)"
3,@renftlabs @jpeg_dealer420 Oh that’s awesome! So I’m assuming the collateral and rental income is held in some sort of escrow by renft?
4,"@renftlabs @jpeg_dealer420 Collateral-based being for the 721 standard and collateral-free being used for the 1155 standard?

Also, is it possible for the lender to run away with the collateral? e.g. The NFT price crashes and the collateral is worth more?"
5,"@jpeg_dealer420 @renftlabs Any idea why you have to pay collateral when renting on @renftlabs? 

Curious if this is because the NFT is at risk of being stolen."
6,Do NFT rental marketplaces not exist?

62,@NFTWithMe_ @SuperlativeSS @PoisedMeerkat I’ve made a couple calls.. the R&amp;D on thermal SSS adult onesies is in motion. https://t.co/LN0D5NAWuL
63,@InctubeTweets I think the space needed this.. We have to learn early on as a community how to spot these scams and not blindly trust anon people.
64,"@bobble_NFT It doesn't matter anymore. This space is here to stay and isn't going anywhere, just like the internet in the 90's. 

It will continue to grow until there is mass adoption so It's good that people learn early on to trust no one."
65,"“Your reputation matters”

No, it doesn’t. For a lot of these influencers rugging millions of dollars was the end game."
66,"@mdizzle_NFT @LooksRareNFT You’re missing my point. 

I didn’t say LooksRare was a rug, I said the platforms early success will motivate scammers to try and copy its success."
67,"LooksRare team made a big chunk of change in a few months - $70 mil I think? 

The next wave of NFT rugs are gonna be platforms, not art."
68,"@bobble_NFT 90% of teams won’t know how to monetize a big community or leverage it.

The people who rug pull millions of dollars aren’t smart, they’re lucky."
69,"@bobble_NFT Yup. Most projects have completely anonymous founders and they’re making a couple mil each mint. 

If they stuck around they’d burn through the money quickly. Better to rug in their eyes than burn through the cash trying to create the next BAYC."
