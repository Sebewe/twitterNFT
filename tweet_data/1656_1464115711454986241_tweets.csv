6,"RT @andrwwang: ✅ 

thank you, @dannylee https://t.co/UX8xpqf26t"
7,"@andrwwang But in all seriousness, thank you for all you do Andrew. You are such an inspiration to not only me but to the entire community. Big big love to the entire @reli3fxyz team and everybody else that's making the world a better place 💙🙏💛"
8,PS: Shout out the Web3 Avengers @reli3fxyz @Ukraine_DAO @timepieces and everybody involved in doing their part and making the world a better place!! 💙🙏💛
9,So let's mobilize and unite. Let's educate those that are curious and be patient when they’re ready. I'm a firm believer and this is why I'm all in on this space.
10,We are in a paradigm shift. A transition from a traditional/centralized world to a brave/decentralized one. One that is egoless and permissionless. We have the keys and authority to build it together. But with great opportunity comes great responsibility.
11,"I think NFTs are a great entry point into what is possible in the broader metaverse moving forward.

TL;DR: As much as I loved my previous work, there's simply no way I'm going to miss this opportunity. This is what I've been waiting for my entire life."
12,"We have the technology, the resource, and most importantly the community to build with!"
13,"This is our opportunity to build multiple versions of Manhattan, Los Angeles, London, Paris and Tokyo. Multiple versions of Earth and Mars. Then the community can decide governance, structure and allocation"
14,"In this generation's version, all are invited to build and participate. It is not limited or restricted by class or invite. And while I (and many others) feel like we have missed out on things in the past, if you are reading this, you are still early to Web3."
15,"Conclusion: My interpretation of Web3 and the broader metaverse is this is the digital version of the ""Industrial Revolution."" We were not born in the late 17 or 1800s. And our last names are not Rockefeller or Carnegie nor are we freemasons."
16,"A passionate culture collector, community member, and financial technologist. It slapped me in the face and immediately struck me that all those times I feel like I missed the boat on something led me up to this very moment."
17,"Ex #4: FFW to present. Cryptocurrencies have been around for nearly a decade, many of its concepts have been proven/adopted, and the broader idea of Web3 and the metaverse is now in play. When I first heard of NFTs, it reminded me of where I came from. 🙇‍♂️"
18,"This was essentially the beginning of Web2, and while I was better positioned for it age and resource wise, I had other goals. So this one’s on me. I missed the boat. But for the record I wouldn't give any of it back, no ragrets. https://t.co/pSpbM26Eth"
19,"@andrwwang No, you."
20,"Ex #3:Just graduated high school and social media and blogs are a thing. Friendster, Myspace, Xanga, Live Journal then Facebook. But my interests changed. I took a career path into music to become a full time party degen. https://t.co/X6iw6nndSG"
21,"We were obsessed with reading PC Mag, which led to other publications, and we had an understanding of the 90s dot com tech bubble aka Web1.  But again, we weren't old enough to know how to build a company, so I just witnessed from the sidelines (again). https://t.co/fepN0r9v8I"
22,"Ex #2: Growing up, I didn’t come from much but went to a private elementary school where most of my classmates had laptops. We learned Visual Basic 5 and C++. We built AOL IM proggiez and booters lol (idiots). https://t.co/jYmK2VdmRM"
23,"I remember wishing I was born a few years earlier so that I'd have a job, higher income and be better positioned to sweep assets like Michael Jordan's 86-87 Fleer rookie cards. https://t.co/7swnbuogxL"
24,"I saw the correlation between athlete performance and their asset value/stock price. However, my liquidity was limited as I was still just a kid. https://t.co/clqZYZ7Zex"
25,"Ex #1:  I started trading sports cards, memorabilia, comic books, stamps and coins domestically (US) when I was 7, and  internationally at 11 (AOL 3.0). I studied price guides (Beckett and TUFF STUFF) religiously. I understood market trends and statistics. https://t.co/ppgVBLyX9h"
26,"I'm fascinated by both sub and pop culture (i.e. was a DJ, skater, graffiti artist, bboy, but also played sports, chess, MTG, D&amp;D, pokemon, video games, etc.). Also have a professional background in project mgmt &amp; financial technology (FinTech). https://t.co/1zmNci0FIY"
27,"🌐3️⃣💭 WHY IM ALL IN ON WEB3, NFT AND THE METAVERSE 🌐3️⃣🧵

Context: My dad bought me an i386 PC for my 3rd bday, I'm a lifelong hobbyist of collectibles, and I love all things community based and culture. https://t.co/In7OMLM3nS"
