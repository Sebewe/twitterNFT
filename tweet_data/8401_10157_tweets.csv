0,I’d also like to thanks @Fly666Mc who also donated freeukraine.eth to them.
1,@cryptophinn @ctjlewis @FireblocksHQ I’d love to hear suggestions.
2,"Our goal is to make it safe without creating any technical burden in their side. We’re discussing solutions, including using a third party (like ensdao.eth) or some other type of contract. If anyone has some insight it would be cool to hear. https://t.co/V3S13AF6CW"
3,"Ukraine.eth was generously acquired by @KittyInuToken and I’ve helped them set it up to point to the correct donation address in both ether and Bitcoin to facilitate donations.

We have not yet transferred ownership to them because it seems it’s an exchange address."
4,"@LefterisJP @kbw We have a call set up to hear more. But it’s not as bleak: if there’s good reason to believe you did not know, then it’s unlikely that anything will happen. But if I become a director then that responsibility increases for me."
5,"While that’s weird in a international blockchain, legal believes that in the case of a breach of sanctions, some major delegates (specially if they’re citizens of the country giving out sanctions) could potentially be personally held liable.

You were airdropped responsibility."
6,"Regarding the “due diligence” I mentioned. After talking with lawyers, I would advise all delegates (and potential directors) to be more through on checking country of origin recipients with any disbursement of funds."
7,"In the future, I wish we can find a process that allows more time hearing and empathizing and less focus on in/out group thinking and punishment.
Because the outcome now was just having stronger think bubbles and not better inter bubble cooperation."
8,"Marshal Rosenberg, creator of Non Violent communication said: “Peace requires something far more difficult than revenge or merely turning the other cheek; it requires empathizing with the fears and unmet needs that provide the impetus for people to attack each other.”"
9,"Regarding the Brantly situation, I am okay with any outcome. While I abhor the things he has said, I haven’t found any anecdote that he actually acted in an intolerant way towards anybody. But most importantly i think the whole process was too fast and chaotic."
10,"Dear ENS holders who delegate to me: This is an important week with 7 open votes.
* I will be abstaining from voting on directorship issues because I’m a candidate.
* I will probably vote in support for all budgets as soon as I do some due diligence on the recipients"
11,"@sam_defi @KittyInuToken @opensea @Ukraine It’s actually a bit more complex: there are 3 steps that need to be done, in order: change the text record, change the controller and change the owner. 

Ens is working to reduce these steps."
12,@Sbirovski @opensea @Ukraine I’ll dm you to help
13,"@_axtina @MisspelledETH @EnsSales @KittyInuToken @ensdomains Thanks. I’ve reached out to your official channel to help the transfer.

Our goal is not have “great PR” for ens domains, but help them get donations in a safer way."
14,@OurielOhayon @opensea Having to mint and nft to message someone is really terrible
15,Dear LatAm100 on @opensea: don’t try to make a $100k from this humanitarian crisis by flipping your name. Contact me and I’ll help you correctly point it to the address and donate it to Ukraine. I’ll compensate you a reasonable amount. https://t.co/GEz523onac

17,"A good friend told me he had six Ukrainians in his dev team. I asked if they were safe:
-it’s complicated. Most don’t want to get out, they want to stay and fight. 

Those were nerds who about a week ago were doing blockchain development work. Crazy."
18,"Some sort of verification badge is something ENS should work on. Ukraine.eth and freeukraine.eth are registered and not in use, so maybe it’s an indication that names renewals are too cheap right now? https://t.co/xdIUpspo5F"

20,@dirkjaeckel @mr_ligi @LefterisJP @davebit_ @pedrouid Good idea. Germany should’ve thought about this before shutting down their nuclear plants.
21,"@mr_ligi @LefterisJP @davebit_ @pedrouid I doubt putin wants a long prolonged and expensive war. Not saying this is the ideal outcome (see Syria for the dangers of just arming rebels and prolonging a complex conflict), but imagine what a fast victory means for him."
22,"@mr_ligi @LefterisJP @davebit_ @pedrouid Those who don’t want to fight should be free to do so and take refuge elsewhere (including Russian soldiers who wish to desert Putin!). But those who decide to risk their own lives, deserve to have the back of the international community somehow. Putin doesn’t want a long war."
23,"@mr_ligi @LefterisJP @davebit_ @pedrouid I think there’s a big difference between being sent to war in a foreign country for the interest of the rich, and voluntarily taking arms to defend your home. While I’m a pacifist who never touched a weapon, I respect the latter."
24,@stephantual Are you seriously saying the war is less severe than the lockdowns? And that the Jewish president is a Nazi supporter?
25,@mr_ligi @LefterisJP *”the irony of..”
26,@ryaneeth Too bad. Would’ve been useful for them

30,@Sim_Pop @danrobinson @lawmaster Are you saying Canadian truckers should get nukes?
31,@pmarca @brendan_opensea Would be hilarious if the west saved the planet from oil just to spite Russia.
32,@halfpantograph @mattblaze Oh China wouldn’t just sell them phones.
33,"@mr_ligi @LefterisJP Sure, but you do realize of defending sanctions while we work on money that is unsanctionable"
34,@shaunmmaguire @twobitidiot The west can barely agree to sanction them in any meaningful way.
35,"@Timccopeland @elmalandr0 Not having a company that “upgrades” the blockchain.
Ethereum evolves by consensus not only in the software but by reaching consensus of hundreds of companies (software makers, app makers, exchanges, wallet makers, etc) on what they will accept as changes in the future."
36,@opiumhum @songadaymann I didn’t realize there were attacks also on Kiev and the rest of Ukraine other than the one already under civil war
37,"(Quote if from memory, the guy does 8h podcasts about all of all sorts of history that go in crazy deep tangents so I couldn’t find when exactly he said it. He could’ve said it while talking about Gengis khan for all I know)"
38,"Something @dccommonsense once said I never forgot: “Ukraine is a tidal island, whenever the tides of the Russian empire are low, it becomes independent, but when the tides rises once more, Ukraine disappears under the sea again”

Let us hope for a low tide soon."
39,@elmalandr0 @Timccopeland Yes the trouble of steem was onchain governance
40,Don’t know why smart people keep making that mistake but even having a majority control on a PoS chain doesn’t give you free reign to do whatever you want. Having 51% control on a PoW chain doesn’t either by the way. https://t.co/OnSGQWpoaR
41,"@balajis You can’t “rewrite history” with proof of stake. PoS is not some kind of democracy in which they arbitrarily vote whatever they want the chain to be in the next block, it’s a rigid game in which cheating can be much more expensive than PoW."
42,@lemiscate Black nyan cat and the black Osaka one are the prettiest
43,@nikkolasg1 @initc3org Does it mean some node operators could decrypt ahead of time?
44,"@nikkolasg1 @initc3org Timelock encryption (without pow) seems fascinating. But I can’t wrap my head on how it works: once you encrypt to a future randomness, why can’t someone simulate the future beacons randomness to decrypt it? What new information is made in the future that you don’t have now?"
45,@elguakmole Satoshi never tried to cash out.
46,@taoeffect @from_futures @famousleaf Well we also just followed the code. And the code left a lot of traces pointing to his name.
47,"@Jenny_Pollack @Fatalmeh @q9fmz @degen_chimp @ph_lux @MPtherealmvp @danhwang88 No doubt. Maybe we should deeply thank Toby for helping us reinforce our systems and mature the tooling for DAOs. Our computers are more secure. 

But if he had dropped it, he would have never been doxxed. That’s now his problem, not mine."
48,"@Fatalmeh @Jenny_Pollack @q9fmz @degen_chimp @ph_lux @MPtherealmvp @danhwang88 It’s not “great benevolence” to NOT to attempt to steal a hundred million dollars, it’s basic decency."
49,"@Jenny_Pollack @Fatalmeh @q9fmz @degen_chimp @ph_lux @MPtherealmvp @danhwang88 Sure, I had the privilege of knowing a lot of people and that’s why I jumped to help. 
But he did manage to take out 30% of the DAO by himself. He could right then have announced on an anonymous account on reddit that he intended to give it back, and the community would help."
50,@jackbutcher Original open source tech.
51,"@Fatalmeh @Jenny_Pollack @q9fmz @degen_chimp @ph_lux @MPtherealmvp @danhwang88 Yet, that’s what I did."
52,"@jackbutcher Yes sir, I’ve got a contender. Free to share, changed drastically all societies it arrived in, almost universally accepted in all cultures. https://t.co/34GlKPQKTa"
53,"@Jenny_Pollack @q9fmz @degen_chimp @ph_lux @MPtherealmvp @danhwang88 The hacker could’ve done what we did:
* contact people privately and offer help
* exploit the code and take the money out
* immediately alert people “the DAO is being securely drained” to avoid market fears
* write a recovery contract that gives the money back to token holders"
54,@degen_chimp @q9fmz @ph_lux @MPtherealmvp @danhwang88 Exactly. One conducted himself in a selfish manner to enrich themselves out of the others. The other can reasonably say he was just accidentally probing stuff and didn’t intend to cause a catastrophe (unless it turns out he had shorted eth and went looking for mayhem).
55,"@ph_lux @MPtherealmvp @q9fmz @danhwang88 Well the guy didn’t steal anyone, he just found a big red button saying “don’t push this” and pressed it."
56,"@CryptoSigmaMale ? 
It would change nothing?"
57,@felipefaraggi @sunnya97 Not so anticlimactic anymore isn’t it?
58,"Old ethereum shirts used to have a sample code in the back, to show how easy it was to launch a token or an auction.

60,"@nicksdjohnson @Hershy_WWYc @laurashin Last time I met griff he gave me a shoulder massage. He’d win, there’s no contest."
61,@nicksdjohnson “The hammer fell down and V lied to laura shin”.. now I’m curious about that!!
62,"@RalphClaytonUk @tayvano_ @0xTycoon The conjoin was a crucial part of how the ID worked, and if that falls apart under scrutiny the whole thesis might too.

But.. I have to say once she found him and went for corroborating evidence, he acted guilty as hell."
63,@tayvano_ But I haven’t even finished writing my report of what else we uncovered during the DAO hacker chain analysis!
64,"@JLHeartsCrypto I think you can certainly fit 10k individual VHS/DVD boxes in a typical video rental store back in these days. I don’t think they had so many repeated titles: except for the hot releases, most videos had 1 or 2 copies.

https://t.co/JNXlT3Jb1q"
65,"@Hershy_WWYc @laurashin In the unchained podcast the host asks Laura if it didn’t raise any red flags the fact that the report was being commissioned by the person being investigated. Even Laura seems to find the suggestion funny on the show: “I mean, if he was the hacker why would he be telling me?”"
66,@satoshiPL Anyone can be a hacker. https://t.co/0tyDgyu3JN
67,@waynegeorg @sethforprivacy The flaw on grin is that he sent it to a node called “Toby” on the same IP address as his company’s public LN. 🤷‍♂️
68,"@ethmarek Computer crimes are hard to define precisely (Aaron Swartz was persecuted for violating the terms of service, since he had legit access to download docs) but if someone feels harmed by his actions in general they can press charges."
69,I love the sound of multiple writer rooms furiously having to rewrite their upcoming movie script
70,@akomba We found it when looking at his transactions. Don’t know if it made Laura’s book.
71,"Also, that wasn’t the first attempt of the DAO hacker to attack ethereum. There was another."
72,"I have no pity on Toby Hoenisch, if he is truly the guy. That period was stressful for all of us, we almost saw everything we had build fracture and fall.

Ether was $10 back then, ICO’s hadn’t happened yet. He could easily still be a legit millionaire and a hero. He choose it."
73,"So in short the DAO hacker used:
* Shapeshift to convert ETC to BTC
* Wasabi to mix the BTC
* 4 Different central exchanges
* Withdrawn to Grin for added privacy

And yet he was a found. Thanks to chain analysis, insider cooperation and the hacker’s ego. It only takes one error."
74,@laurashin @Coinfirm_io @chainalysis And apparently a huge thanks to the anonymous exchange employee who revealed the IP address of their client 😉
75,"Yup. Wasabi coin joins are dead.
Only privacy is a cryptographically proven method, like ZCash or Tornado. And even the latter is iffy because the pool size is very limited (and many nodes are likely honeypots) https://t.co/BCHhqYKPm3"
76,@gutomartino @laurashin @Unchained_pod @Steven_Ehrlich @ForbesCrypto I’ll write more about that soon

83,@theobtl @joincolony But do motions require stake or reputation? Can’t someone just buy a lot of stake in order to pass a bunch of motions for themselves?
84,"Would be cool if @MEVprotection🐮 allowed you to trade among chains. It’s already happening off chain, then why not make it a bridge too?"
85,"@theobtl @joincolony Thanks for answering my next question on when I should see the reputation 😉 

Is the fact that my colony’s native token is ENS (a very liquid token) and not some internal reputation based dao, affect the security of my colony? Because anyone can buy lots of it!"
86,"@theobtl @joincolony &gt; Colony‘s reputation system, of course, cannot know who deserves initial rep. 

Maybe ask the colony creator how to distribute initial reputation? Or at least give some to the creator itself and people he invites? 😉"
87,@theobtl @joincolony Ah! I wasn’t sure if forced transactions gathered reputation!
