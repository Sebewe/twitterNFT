25,"Stay away from @FudderVerse. We were promised a rug, but it's looking more and more like a successful project. https://t.co/rJJWjXTK4P"
26,Every announcement in the @NotTodayClub discord ends with partial song lyrics that you have to finish in the general chat to prove you read the announcement. Some of yalls parents set up mandatory playdates for other kids to play with you and it shows.
27,"Booted from @NotTodayClub discord for lack of participation... because everyone knows the best way to build a happy, active community is to force people to be happy and active with threat of banishment. https://t.co/mFp6alJ8aD"
28,@FuddersBot nice
29,I'm a big fan of what @swipathefox has been doing in the NFT space. The @FudderVerse floor has been pumping too much lately. Need to bring De'Aaron on board to guide us to zero with his steady hand. https://t.co/vX0BeKBbWy

46,@hyperpoptone you need to collect commission. im about to go buy some of these cuz u keep posting about em.
47,I saw this @FudderVerse and thought it looked rare. I confirmed that it wasn't (not even close) but then bought it anyway for 2x floor. These are the kinds of big brain moves I make in this space #NGMI 📉📉📉 https://t.co/K4QmhQ1boI
48,@Crypto_figgy @FudderVerse lol youre right. the chances of fudders mooning are as dead as uncle ben.

50,"Me, watching the @FudderVerse floor not go to zero but rocket to 0.07 ETH instead. The head trait on this is ""Straight Buns"" which is fitting because this project is straight buns tbh. https://t.co/HHyycOoO08"

Bottom 10 rarity according to nft-stats. Among the worst of the worst. #LNFG #NGMI https://t.co/2mtgzH1Vwt"

77,lmao luka gonna drop 50 on LAC. he fucking hates them.
78,"Giving af what ""celebs"" are doing is so web2. If you're on NFT twitter and are active in a discord you likely know more about this shit than these famous dudes. In the same way you wouldn't ask your toddler what car you should buy, who gaf what celebs are aping into."

Anyway, the reason I took an L on FF was bc I needed ETH for this bad boy. Hunter S mouth ghost with visible lungs. Have mercy (Uncle Jesse voice) #LongLostNFT https://t.co/l41yxMinUc"
89,"I woke up this morning and chose violence. I obviously don't like @fishyfamNFT and have an axe to grind, but feel free to read through these replies and form your own opinion. https://t.co/35lrpfUmQB"
90,"Wait, so @fishyfamNFT airdropped a #fishyfam into Steve Aoki's wallet unsolicited and are pumping it as if he aped in? Cringe. No wonder the floor didn't move after that announcement. Sold the one I held last night for a 0.3 ETH loss. So happy to be done with this shit project."
