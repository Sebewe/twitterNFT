78,@iwwon_official @PixelEthie What if I was to sue @opensea and the company who filled the DMCA for blocking MY art that has nothing to do with their DMCA violation? I own this art and all its commercial uses. MY art is unique 1/1. This is damaging me financially and causing me emotional distress.

85,"@lolitataub I thought about this too. It's romantic to have archival footage of the ""early days"" but people are only going to watch it after you're already successful. It could work for niche cases but I doubt your dog food brand needs to inform the public how hard it is to launch a start up"
86,@DavidSacks Figures crossed. I hope they come to an agreement. I DO NOT want our boys going in Ukraine but I think the US sending 7k troops on a German vacation is a joke. You move a couple defensive carrier groups and then Putin will chat.
