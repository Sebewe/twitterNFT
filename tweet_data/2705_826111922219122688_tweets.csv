Feed refrshed before I could read an interesting post and I’ve spent wayyy too much time going through my followings  to find that one account LOL #Twitter"

5,"@alexhughsam Thanks for constantly reminding me I f*up 😭 Glad the projet is doing well tho, can’t wait to jump back in when I have a chance!"
6,"@coolcatsnft Cool Pets’ floor currently being at 1.5ETH reminds me how early we still are in the nft space.

I get people are mad cause cooltopia keeps getting delayed but if you selling now please hit me up again in a couple months so we can talk about how you f*up 🤣 #coolpets"
7,@InsightRh @GENESIS_SENSHI @GHARLIERA1 Nice! Thanks for the clear and detailed analysis! I really like your format. Feels good to see something else than the classic pump and hype! Keep it up!
8,"@khoshy Same! Whatever move I make, I strongly advice to do the complete opposite if you wanna be successful 😅"
9,@Twitter Would be cool if Twitter Blue users could turn off sponsored posts…

I can feel your pain 🥲"

39,"A lot of my friends are hesitant to jump into nfts cause they don't know the different terms used in the space and find it overwhelming. 

I'm starting this encyclopedia of basic NFT/web3 terms where I will thread one definition a day until I cover the basis.

41,Hot take: Have people solve a puzzle so they can access your discord channel isn't the way to go.. We can do better than this.
42,Hot take: Discord verification where you need to open your dms aren’t the way to go.. We can do better than this.
43,PFP NFT projects start and are build around the Art. Artists should always be treated with respect! Glad we saw everybody's true colors today! Go support @Dentinmyhead and give a follow to his 🔥 upcoming project 🙌 https://t.co/spLAuwVas4
44,@StarcatchersNFT Wow. You have all my respect 🙌
45,Went to bed bullish on @TheEverai then woke up to this and I'm even more bullish now!!! LFG!! https://t.co/izI9WMSpIZ
46,@Ledger @MetaMask @Twitter @MetaMaskSupport @TwitterSupport
47,@Ledger @MetaMask @Twitter Would be great to be able to connect my Hardware wallet to use my NFTs as profile picture.. Any ETA on when either Twitter nft web support or Metamask mobile Ledger support's coming up?
48,Just finished setting up my first cold wallet. Thanks @Ledger for an A1 onboarding user-experience. My precious egg @coolcatsnft is now secured!!!

55,@RTFKTstudios When my friend @alexhughsam spent 9 eth on Fewo x RTFKT and I made fun of him saying he was crazy… Little did I know I was the dumb one here… Lesson learned: RTFKT projects are always worth it no matter the price…
