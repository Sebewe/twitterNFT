29,"@Etttttthan @emily_proud Judge not, lest ye be judged."
30,"@emily_proud One away from 69,420 which is actually a special number in many’s hearts"
31,"@ZyoriTV @fernandogarzaaa Even the federal reserve gives forward guidance, devs change economy unilaterally without warning. Wondering you as fearful as we are at the widening spread between minted and burned SLP. Axie prices going down AND less SLP being burned (less breeding) is a bad omen no?"
32,"@vittoriobndnft @Jihoz_Axie Everything is priced in ETH,"
33,"@Jihoz_Axie Do you think this update creates a new reason to use axies and play? Doesn’t this update go in conflict with this white paper? Seems like the new SLP minting update will reduce the player population not increase it. Also, reason for lower Axie prices = less demand?"
34,"@brycent_ @EmersonSpiff Explain how the changes here encourage people to play?? There is nothing
 INCLUSIVE about this update."
35,"This activity reeks of desperation. I don’t think the devs have any idea what they are doing, the product roadmap must be so far delayed they are trying to look like they can add value here with changes. I’m not below 800 MMR but still disgusted https://t.co/22w4gAdZlg"

37,"@NFT_Guru a whole lot of “trust us” is being thrown around a game that is supposedly decentralized and owned by the community. This was a unilateral change, that came with NO WARNING and no discussion with the community. This.feels like a easy (lazy) fix to economy without new content"

40,@BCAppelbaum The community desperately needs a writer who actually understands Crypto economy and mechanisms. This article is so superficial it borderlines on disingenuous.

47,I wonder if current BTC and ETH maxis are fluent in the history of Edison v. Tesla. Feels like the argument for digital currency supremacy is akin to arguing of AC or DC voltage.

54,@smykjain @LiquityProtocol @Instadapp @thrilok_kumar @smykjain I know you hear this a lot. But let me say it again for the people in the back. You and the entire INST team ROCK! Thanks for all you guys do. Can tell you are putting your blood and sweat into this platform
55,"@epochchain @LiquityProtocol @Instadapp Appears not. in fact you have to withdraw your INST from the INST platform to your wallet to count for the snapshot, which seems counterintuitive IMHO."
56,@LiquityProtocol @Instadapp All my INST is on the INST platform. So I’m assuming I have to withdraw from my liquify pools and withdraw from INST into my wallet to have any voting power. It’s kind of confusing tbh. Maybe I’m a rube.

58,@0xElle @gabusch Is there an FAQ or best practices for being an Axie Manager? All the subreddits / discords its hard to find a breakdown of best practices &amp; how to get set up.
