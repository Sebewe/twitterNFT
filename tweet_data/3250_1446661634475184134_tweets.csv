Participate in DAOs, or use web2 training platforms to learn how to code/build. Lots to do in the space, and we’re going to need talent!"

41,"Recently spent about an eth to pick these up. Why? Well first, I’m too broke to get an Azuki, CloneX or Mutant. Secondly, I like them! Feels good to mint/buy/commission without any expectation of returns. https://t.co/zfXa08xp2U"
42,@dmoravec @BoredApeYC Love it!
43,@BlockchainHedge @dmoravec @opensea @DecentralGames My recent buys have been “about the art”. Zero fucks if they go to zero

62,"10. The future
No one knows how NFTs will play out in a year, 5 or 10. We are definitely in an upward adoption phase, driving up prices. How long will it last? It helps if you have a cash out number in mind from the start.

End 🧵"
63,"9.  Security
Use a HW wallet. Reduce your attack surface by limiting the devices you use to trade. Close your DMs by default. If it’s too good to be true.. it is."
64,"8. Rares vs floors (2/2) 
Commons are much easier to unload, the liquidity is always at the bottom of the collection. Rares take a specific buyer looking for that trait to sell. The return is slower, and often by % equivalent of how a floor performs."
65,"7. Rares vs floors (1/2)
First off, having the rarest NFT in a shit project is worthless. Make sure you’re on the right rocket ship. If your NFT isn’t in the top 100 of a 10k project, it really doesn’t matter too much. Rares will sell faster at floor prices in a crunch."
66,"6. Conviction
This is what I’ve noticed all the whales have. They go all in. All in on projects in which they have 50+ NFTs. It’s the same with life, diversify to be a millionaire, be the best at something and have a shot at becoming a billionaire."
67,"5. Networking
It’s true that community is a huge aspect of NFTs. My biggest wins recently have come from the alpha being shared within discords, and private group chats. NFTs open the doors to these spaces.. literally via https://t.co/aZKiFydijd 🤓 Build your network anon."
68,"4. Minting vs secondary
I hardly ever mint. There are lots of ways to make money, including minting and selling before reveal. It all depends on your risk tolerance and budget (time and eth). My own strategy is to buy more expensive proven projects, less risk &amp; less upside"
69,"3. In it for the art - or not. 
Are you a collector? Investor? A little of both? There are projects that I don’t have a strong affinity for the art, but they are solid blue chips. I’ve also bought projects which I don’t care if it goes to zero, the art is cool."
70,"2. Emotions - investing by a methodical data driven approach is difficult. Only experience can teach you how to manage that. I traded stocks and crypto long before coming into NFTs. If you’re tempted to rage quit and take the low ball WETH offer, take a minute and think about it"
71,"1. What are your goals? My initial goal was to learn about NFTs. I wasn’t early by any means, but I needed to buy one to understand the process and mechanics of buying/selling/securing. The investing aspect came later as I realized some projects were rising rapidly."
72,"I’m up 4x on my NFT portfolio since investing 6 months ago. Here’s what I’ve learned. Most will seem obvious but difficult to execute. 

These won’t be in any particular order. This is also primarily for myself to document my journey.
