14,@hugo43669628 @Syberer Judging by your pfp makes sense
15,@CanesEDIT @boredape1234 @Syberer Kevin has to be worth 10 eth after all this
16,@Syberer You think the SEC is gonna let you walk with 70 million dollars with a class action law suit . Haha 😂
17,@JackPosobiec Your a fucking moron jack. And if trump would have been in support of Putin ? You would be cheering on Russia. Such a fake American.

22,"@cryptjoe9 Dude writes a giant apology letter after taking 30,000 eth . That was just from mint."
23,"@Syberer @Pixelmon At 3 eth mint that’s 90 million dollars or 30,000 eth. Wonder if the majority will go where you claim ."
24,@kylefredrickson @sbjsbd That’s because of comcast .
25,@Pauliespasta @JackPosobiec You guys are fucking traitors to your country .
26,@Logan_Rote @MichaelRapaport @jimmykimmel Wow you must be a special kind of stupid. Even trump had to sanction Russia multiple times. The dude poisoned a journalist. He also fixed his election. Since we is America full of communist loving idiots?
27,@enieves1990 @MichaelRapaport @jimmykimmel World peace ? How dumb are you? How unamerican have you become to side with communism. Trump ripped our country in 2 and now you idiots are still playing along. Americans don’t hate each other until trump divided us. Now you guys side with Russia because Biden ? What an idiot .
28,@suze_kemper @MichaelRapaport @jimmykimmel Suze is a communist loving traitor. News flash before trump we hated Russia . And didn’t hate our own. You’ve been brainwashed by this idiot and now your unamerican. You choose Russia over America . Good job suze
29,@kaitlin_easton Scammer that’s even your doodle
30,"@TheShamdoo Bro bad form , 44 million people live there . Not to mention a huge part of the NFT community is from there . Check your feed it’s all over. If Putin can do this he can do it all over the world. It’s a big deal. Nuclear war isn’t a joke . Imagine if you got drafted ."
31,"@JackPosobiec Except in our own country https://t.co/zRqTmhiIeW

32,@AstonDreamz Agreed they act like gate keepers any of them that got white listed love the project .
33,@kdonenine @InvsbleFriends Jealousy creates a lot of fud people wanted to hate it because they didn’t get white listed it also created fomo. The previews of the art has been fun for all of us. We all knew it would moon. The first time I saw it I knew it was the next doodles. I don’t think it will crash .
34,"@cryptjoe9 There was a moment when it was time to sell before rewards formmm got cuff my in half . Thi’e thankplatform is sub par. It allowed manipulation, wash  trading ; and the platform was mids. Until a real competitor comes in (coinbase) these others are just cash grabs ."

72,@BT @crypto888crypto Ya man good call even if it goes down to .2 for a mint the secondary sales will speak for them selves if the project is what you expect . The floor will rise with community
73,@0x_fxnction Well according to my math I would have cashed out at 2000 and now it will be closer to 5000 on Friday .
74,"@not_katarina I can’t tell you how many of my friends are like hey let’s make nfts ? Instead of buying them or Lear internet about them they think oh no , we can just make our own and get rich right ."
75,"@BT What a bad look, you’ve been in the space long enough to know how many shortcuts you just tried to take. I don’t care if it’s your life’s work it’s not worth 11 eth to mint. Doodles, azuki, cool cats all made it to 11 eth with a mint well under 1 eth. Your community decides ."

81,@danielgothits My thoughts exactly
82,@CryptoJaythe1st @Helloimmorgan Bro her public wallet has well over 50eth worth of jpeg. And her back round says she owns closer to 100 eth worth of stuff this chick is a con woman
83,"@Helloimmorgan You have well over 50 eth worth of nfts probably more in another wallet. Especially if you still own cool cat and doodle . You own Mayc , coolman , dead fellas . Multiple projects over 1eth."
84,"@Helloimmorgan Who would ask for 20,000 dollars from strangers when you own Jpegs worth more then that . 

Mutant is worth 19 eth . Sell it give the donator his money back then buy a doodle or something. But your stealing from the community by asking for the money . That’s like panhandling"

Tiger is obviously the goat 
Lebron debatable but mj missed more playoffs then he was in. 
Steve Jobs ? Not even close he was a great innovator but not great at business . He couldn’t even run his own company.

95,"@NBABlackburn No way should he submit , embid has never played a full season so we will see how this goes:the nuggets have one of the easiest schedules in the league . Jokic is gonna rack of up stats and wins. And if we get both mpj and Murray back we are title contenders ."
