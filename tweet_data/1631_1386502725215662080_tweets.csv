31,@FtNifty I need to do some research 📈
32,"Well… I guess an alpha chat is pretty much a pump and dump. Not my intentions, but I see what y’all are saying. I’m still going to do the challenge, but not going to charge people :)"
33,@DVBTK Dm ur addy
34,@valueandtime @cryptorayrays
35,@Kenn1k_Nguyen Did you look at my openseas?

41,@dr_edje Great project. Love the initiative
42,"@Wearyourmask4 Ik it is, but I’m legit and I know the value I can offer people."
43,@Wamboozled Dm ur addy
44,@web3welder I want people to win in this space. Like for real
45,@NotZainAgain All I’m doing is telling people what I’m buying and what I’m selling. Don’t read too deep into it.
46,"I was going to make it fun and do a 1 eth to 10 eth challenge. Nope, people still get mad. If you want in, join. If you don’t, dont. I don’t care either way lol"
47,"People are so angry in this space. I offer to share my plays in an alpha chat that costs money to enter, and people lose their minds. Why are people mad that I’m good at what I do and I want to make money for you and myself? Craziness…"
48,@MarioJerel Why not make me and others money when I’m good at what I do?
49,@MarioJerel Topshotkief and topshotkiefvault
50,@MarioJerel You are right. Just invest in every piece of alpha you see on twitter. No need to pay because it’s free! You’ll pay in your losses tho :)
51,@CDonaldson2980 @gratefullydad Dm me ur eth addy
52,@CDonaldson2980 @gratefullydad I’m going to give it a week or so
53,@CDonaldson2980 @gratefullydad Once I get 200 interested :) getting close
54,@GHollowsquad @Kenn1k_Nguyen I bought my ens from villainous. That’s not my wallet. Look at Topshotkief and topshotkiefvault on opensea
55,@FalconeEth I only put in .4 eth into NFTs. My wallets are Topshotkief and Topshotkiefvault
56,@Kenn1k_Nguyen Topshotkief &amp; topshotkiefvault . Try again :)
57,@saatchiphoto Was .1 at 1000. .5 at 200. Split it with a buddy.
58,@FalconeEth Split it with someone
59,Probably have 140 spots left :)
60,"Starting an alpha chat, just to recap… 200 person cap, .5 eth to enter, and I’m doing a 1 eth to 10 eth challenge. Will be posting all my plays as they happen. You can split it with your friends, idc. once I’ve received 200 addresses interested, It is closed :)"
61,"RT @topshotkief: .5 to get access. Pricey, but it’ll pay for itself. Not going to do it until I have 200 confirmed"
62,".5 to get access. Pricey, but it’ll pay for itself. Not going to do it until I have 200 confirmed"
63,"So 1000 person would be too much for an alpha chat, going to cap at 200. Price to enter is going to go up tho. What y’all think?"
64,@CryptoMikeDee @brokenomoreNFT Appreciate the feedback!
65,@DaYvONb99 That’s unfortunate. You could really use one ;)
66,@CryptoMikeDee @brokenomoreNFT This is a new idea. Going to tweak it until it makes sense.
67,@CryptoMikeDee @brokenomoreNFT You may have a point. May need to scale down the amount of people In the chat and up the mint price. Thank you!
68,@brokenomoreNFT I’ve turned .4 to 500 before. Not afraid to do it again. Wagmi
69,"Alright. Selling an nft alpha chat nft for .2 each. 1000 spots. I’m doing a 1 eth to 10 eth challenge. Follow my plays. I guess it’s illegal to promise gains, but my track record should prove itself  🤑🤑🤫"
70,@gratefullydad Just the cost of the nft. I’m starting with 1 eth and if I don’t make it to 10 eth. I’ll refund the cost of the nft. Mint will be .1-.2
71,"If u want to reserve a spot, dm me your address. We will start the challenge when I have 1000 addresses."
72,"Thinking about selling an nft with my plays. Going to do a 1 eth to 10 eth challenge. Going to sell 1000 spots, if we don’t get it, I’ll refund everyone. Thoughts?"
73,What happened to Mories?
74,"@brrrocto @NFtnERDDD Toby is one of the best guys in the space. He isn’t the main man on WR, but he is an awesome, genuine guy. Not tying him into what happened."
75,@NFtnERDDD What drama?
76,@CryptoMikeDee Letters by vinnie
