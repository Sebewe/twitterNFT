1,What is the best elevator pitch people have seen for NFTs? It's such an expansive field it's hard to condense down.

3,@BobbyTreats_ @RTFKTstudios It’s been super fun following the quest hunting. Some really creative puzzles. Big respect

13,"The average person still deems that web2 authentication services is equivalent or better to web3 cryptographic verification. 

This will hopefully act as a very strong counterexample to this hypothesis. https://t.co/yB0zuqJ5rz"
14,"This is the exact problem. Bots, the rich, and the fastest win on drops.

17,@NotTheDrPhil @feeswtf This is how I think about airdrops with no real utility shown on day 1
18,@NotTheDrPhil @feeswtf Are you bullish about it?
19,@ArtbyCrea what you thinking 👀?
20,"What project is going to be more successful?

21,The real magic of web3 for me is the allocation of funds in a matter of clicks with no intermediaries. Examples like the @doodles community treasury or the @ConstitutionDAO are teasers into the future. https://t.co/czcKxvxM2x
22,"@KoowPlayy @soundxyz_ @join_royal If you need any technical help DM me, currently launching @lets_frame."
23,@pranksy out of interest what is your hypothesis around @doodles? Why are you so bullish
24,@KoowPlayy You planning on releasing this on @soundxyz_  or @join_royal. I think it could be a great move.
25,"@garyvee would love your take on blockchains, do you see Ethereum dominating the NFT space long term or will they be cannibalised by higher performant and cheaper to mint competitors ?"

30,Wen NFT Furniture drop? @IKEAUSAHelp
31,Been awesome to see a digital furniture economy grow around @oncyber_io and @RTFKTstudios in the past few weeks. Feels like an web3 asset which is only going to grow in importance.
32,@benitopagotto Sent you a DM! Built something cool but want to check its ok with you ✨
33,@RTFKTLukson please check your DMs ✨ I have built something exciting for CloneX holders which I would love to discuss with you. Details already there 🌐

35,"@Ape4249 5x murakami drip is 🤯

Stay drippy 🥶"
36,@Ape4249 which of your cloneX’s is your favourite. You have the maddest collection of all time 😂
37,@NotTheDrPhil Is it a different dynamic? less supply -&gt; more hype
38,Do we anticipate that as CloneX mint vials supply tends to 0 it will increase in price like mutant vials 🧪 ?
39,@enneth_t @RTFKTstudios Onboard!!
40,"@RTFKTLukson @RTFKTstudios The intentional hold off on people not revealing their mint vials is super interesting aswell as the pricing mechanics. It seems to be converging at the median price of clones. 

It enables people to have the ‘mint reveal experience’ at any point (well up to the deadline 😂)"
41,@RTFKTLukson @RTFKTstudios Is this higher or lower than you expected?
42,"@benitopagotto @richerd @BoredApeYC This works for established names like 
@BoredApeYC or @RTFKTstudios
 but I think a marketplace with good discoverability has great value for the long tail of projects. 

Fragmentation means fewer eyes."

45,"Going to start creating daily analytics 📊

Starting with @RTFKTstudios's CloneX project.

Here are my thoughts:
1️⃣ Very weak barrier to get to 6.5+ eth
2️⃣ Strong Volumes required to break the 11 ETH
3️⃣ Unbounded potential if it breaks that mark.
