35,"@FreekyCrypto @BoredApeGazette @BoredApeYC @superplastic I agree. I had an issue even with their drop before that and lost 9 ETH. So far I got 5 emails from them in the last month that “we are looking into it”. 

That’s it. 

If this is a mint, I will not participate. They had a mess in every mint so far."
36,"@l0rdmarlborough @Fr0ntierX absolutely love to hear this! 
Thank you"
37,"have a look around, say hi! 

https://t.co/a9jlG3MxoO"
38,"This is just the beginning. 
Explore the new fr0ntier with us and lets get ready!
Sound on. 🚀 https://t.co/q4LWPdccFE"
39,"We will continue this with global brands. Big ones. Several have agreed already, more will come. I wish we could name some, but it's a bit too early.

 Maybe get in now, if you like the idea of voting, working with brands, with the potential for a nice active and passive income."
40,"This week, we did a casual AMA with a senior director from MONSTER ENERGY in our discord for a start.

We are now setting up working groups with our users, where they work with the brand and form the brands' NFT experience. 

We embed our users and we reward them."
41,"We do not have any influencers. We did not accept investors yet, in fact we politely declined several. 
That will change soon, but we want them to understand that this is about community first. 
Not just about money."
42,"We are serious when we say:  
Our mission is not hype. We are here to stay. 
A top 3 NFT platform in five years. 
 Not next month, not this summer. 
Our gameplay is bigger."
43,"Talking about the team: We have handpicked a world class group so far.  Senior people from some of the most successful companies in blockchain tech, on the frontend and product side of things former senior employees from Google, Coca Cola, Adidas and many more. https://t.co/w3OQ5dCK1R"
44,"You can switch between both worlds anytime, fast and easy. 

Our tech team is growing fast and we are headhunting senior people from both the crypto world and some of the biggest companies in the world. Expect the best platform UI/UX you have seen so far."
45,"Fr0ntierX is  a marketplace with two chains. 

One is based on Ethereum, the second is one that is more convenient for brands. Opening the possibility for big airdrops without gas costs. Enabling inexperienced retail people to have their own wallet. 

Simple. Easy. Approachable."
46,"Our biggest motivation for this was to combine web 2.0 with the incredible power and communities of web 3.0.

To integrate users with ownership, without making it impossible for Web 2.0 brands to enter the space.
And that's not as easy as it sounds. https://t.co/JxjlP0C6c0"
47,"LooksRare, X2Y2, fully decentralised ones, of course rarible, etc.  - Coinbase is launching soon and other big players are entering the market, too. 

However, eight months ago we thought that there is still room for something new. Something special."
48,"Fr0ntierX is an NFT marketplace and issuance platform.  And over time it is way more. 

First of all: why another one?
  Its not a big revelation to you that OpenSea - still the no1 platform - does have issues.  And yes, there are many new NFT marketplaces out there. https://t.co/VLXmkxAaDR"

55,"@liambakers don’t see much hype. 
I just see a lot of clout tweets talking about how insane the hype is. 

I’ll be honest. Maybe the biggest hype comes from those doing tweets that there is hype to control their own expectations. 😛"

57,"@itstimconnors I don't know if someone remembers the Ethereum dance thing back in 2018 or so which was way worse. 
And Vitalik rapping in 2019 was also not much better. 

So yeah, this is quite easy compared to that.

59,"@punk9059 100% agreed, it’s tricky. 
I try to focus on those where I feel comfortable holding a long time and where I have enough trust even without checking discord all the time.
Since I switched to this I feel so much more relaxed."

IF launched 3 projects already, all great. With reputable artists. Managing a community in a professional way, grinding and delivering for months and months."
77,"Community gets suspicious about anything now, including some of the most solid projects that successfully launched legit projects before with legit artists and build a community over many months. 

I guess it’s in fashion now to easily throw the word “SCAM” 🙄
