12,"@Bosefina Really interesting point. 

More diverse board rooms, c-suites and cap tables should help. I wrote a bit about how that combats implicit bias, such as this, here.

https://t.co/row0cmKgjx"
13,@saraledterman 100%. The government shouldn’t decide who is sophisticated enough to invest in an asset class they definitely don’t even understand.
14,"Petition, If you’re willing.

“We, people around the world, ask NATO member states to close the airspace over Ukraine and to bring NATO peacekeeping troops into Ukraine, to provide military assistance to Kyiv and to support the Ukrainian people”

26,@Oksana_ATX Thoughts for all of our friends and family in Ukraine. What an absolute disastrous few days. 🇺🇦
27,@KyleJudah A retired military official was just on CNN and said “Ukraine has over performed and Russia has underperformed” and I really needed to hear that right now 🇺🇦
28,"""European governments need to prepare their publics for major increases in refugees fleeing Ukraine and make the case for why they must be supported.""

37,@DOOMille @enjin @efinityio @Startupskelly
38,"@MicroSound_ So moral of the story: an NFT project can nail the storytelling and community but still have no idea how to translate that into a game.  

What are aspiring game developers using to help with that?"

40,@LunarCel_ @crypto_coven Her name is Symphony 🥰🔮https://t.co/OVIfZlvg84
41,"@thulynnn @crypto_coven Great analysis on how NFTs are actually creating value and not just speculative. And so eloquently written. 

""...creating a paradigm shift of storytelling in our times"" 🔮"
42,@LunarCel_ @crypto_coven Welcome! She's amazing.
43,"Web3 investing will drive the next decade of outsized venture returns 

""SaaS diligence is a solved problem"" -@athomasq  
Also, risk = reward. So SaaS risk ⬇️ = reward ⬇️

52,@iamxx__xx @CryptoCoven Love this! Just minted my first.
53,"@NeildaLikeZelda @MacConwell @lolitataub @meaganloyst @ArlanWasHere @nic_detommaso I think building a strong team of support around you so you can focus on the key value drivers for your role. If content creation and digital presence is a part of that, hire skills for the other day-to-day responsibilities like sourcing, diligence etc."
54,"Describe blockchain in 20 words or less to a newbie audience.

A technology that changes everything.  How we access capital. How we build wealth. And how we organize as a society."

61,"Not to brag but when I was in 3rd grade I was in the halftime show of the Super Bowl with Diana Ross.

(Not bragging at all since I was one of thousands of little kids just holding hands with each other and tossing beach balls around)"

https://t.co/g2OWxe0ULj"
73,@sbmiller5 Hubspot seems to work fine for most of our portcos
74,"@MissElisaS @AllRaise @lolitataub @Oksana_ATX Yes! Especially with society’s gender norms causing men and women to be looked at differently even when saying the exact same thing. 

Regardless, I try to live by:

“Bad news never gets better with time” and “the highest level of respect you can give someone is the truth”"
75,"A big part of the Power theme I lead at @mercuryfund is exploring the way tech enables us to organize as communities and as a society. 

@crypto_coven has proven just how powerful (and inclusive) Web3 communities can be and I am *loving* it. 

https://t.co/R8j6EYbLzw"
76,"@ohlookitserik This has to be heavily dependent on what they are building.  If they are struggling bc of volatility in the crypto markets, for example, that's very different than struggling bc Web3 early adopters aren't buying into what they are building."
77,"@_alexmaceda_ Normalize “y’all”! 

Makes those of us who have been saying it our entire lives happy 🤠"

85,@sarah_cone @mercuryfund @Medium Thank you! I think we can find some more companies to co-invest on under it.
86,@NafisaIstami Diligence process!!!
87,@TonnaObaze See how multi faceted strategy actually is bc early employees have exposure to all business units.
88,"@galeforceVC ❌

It’s our job to help find and build innovative companies. With that comes a lot of advice given (solicited or not unfortunately) to startups we talk to along the way and through community development efforts. 

I’d be concerned about the “advice” TBH"
89,@laravvartanian @She__Fi Congrats!!
90,@NafisaIstami Should have let me complete it at lunch!
91,@dradriannestone @chizhao @crypto_coven Her eyes are magical🔮
92,@myfriendjanine My Monstera is wild! I’m trying to get it to grow up instead of crawl out but it isn’t loving the trellis. Any ideas?

96,"Blockchain and fintech will be at the forefront of innovation in a world grappling with social unrest, a widening wealth gap, &amp; climate change.

As a venture capitalist, I'm passionate about empowering forward-thinking founders. If you're one of them, I'd love to hear from you."
97,"At @mercuryfund I lead the Power theme. Power focuses on entrepreneurs building tech that rethinks and disrupts the way society organizes and accesses opportunities to build wealth and knowledge.
