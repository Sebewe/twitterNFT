19,We’re seeing a world-class team build a world-class brand right in front of our eyes. Truly a spectacle a lot of us take for granted. It’s a masterclass of innovation @doodles https://t.co/8rqFI6mOQF
20,"Web3 is changing the world as we see it. So incredibly excited to see projects like these invest time and effort where it’s needed the most right now, ultimately saving lives and bringing people together. 🇺🇦 https://t.co/iSrBnXO7m1"
21,@malibugoes @InvsbleFriends This 100% -- I think that projects with a lack of trait diversity ultimately leads to significant post-reveal floor drops too. The color palette was overall just poor selection and doesn't add any brand value.
22,"Is it just me or was the @InvsbleFriends reveal incredibly underwhelming? A lot of the rares really don't seem rare, and the lack of background diversity kills it for me."

34,"@jameygannon Considering I turned 21 this year, I'd tell myself to live life for myself. Optimize for your personal happiness and cut out all external factors of validation. Also, learn to treat yourself to nice dinners. Finally, you have your entire life ahead of you. Take risks."
35,@DeanMajor5 @Banks You know I gotta add it in there somewhere 👀

40,"7) Sorry, not my very first, but first educational content piece I hope others can directly learn from. Hope y'all enjoy!"
41,"6) Finally, Wrapped NFTs sound cool as hell. And @doodles is one of the first to release it on a large scale: Space Doodles. Been riding since 1 eth floor, and we sure as hell aren't stopping before we take off. 🚀🚀🚀

This was my first long thread attempt, lmk what you think :)"
42,"5) Why do people buy multiple clothing items from a single high-end fashion brand? Because your style changes constantly. You want to signal your fashion through a variety of combinations; each fundamentally representing the same brand. 

Wrapped NFTs allow you to style"
43,"4) For CS:GO players, the range of gun skins you can mix and match. @Banks had a great post. Imagine you can see who unboxed your knife? The blockchain hypothetically counts StatTrak on all kills. Best part? Swapping your skins.

Wrapped NFTs add a layer to your digital ownership"
44,"3) For Minecraft players, the variety of skins you can swap between. With skin creation being fully open to players, you have the artistic freedom to dress up however you'd like. But now, you own Steve *and* every outfit you dress your Steve up in.

Wrapped NFTs enable that shift"
45,"2) For Fortnite players, imagine the different characters you can play with. Fortnite, as a brand, partners with other known brands, and you, as the consumer, can swap between Astro Jack, Lebron James, NFL players, or even John Wick.

Fortnite retains its brand, consumers win big"
46,"Fun analogies to explain why Space Doodles is changing the NFT game and pushing the needle forward. I know there are a lot of threads on this, but here is my investment thesis; inspired by @jpegrich and @degentraland

64,@Degentraland The SAT became particularly relevant on NFT twitter tonight 🤝
65,There should be a minimal 1300 SAT score requirement for people to buy/sell NFTs. Some #mfers sold for 3.3 and 3.5 earlier... logically doesn't make any sense to list 30-40% below floor price for *ANY* project *EVER*
66,Cool story bro. Mfers to 10eth https://t.co/5pDFt356U8

80,"@mrmakerbot Merch and aesthetic are definitely something to each their own. Personally, I would never rock the blue hoodie — makes me feel like I’m back in 6th grade. Black hoodie is the safest bet for mass adoption — although I am disappointed by the lack of content on the hoodie itself"
