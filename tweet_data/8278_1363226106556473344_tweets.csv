2,"@iFirebrand Humanity adapts. Sometimes well too well. Poison becomes water, and as soon as their lips touch real water for the first time, they turn away in disgust, choking, fleeing, fearing."
3,"@LifeOfCrypto Thanks. Yes, I hope so too. 

Can't build the future and live in the metaverse if I'm dead 😅"
4,"Don't drink the water of a well unknown. 

Promising quench of thirst, 
the water you drank,
may have been poison is disguise. 

Do you know truth? Or did you bought a convincing lie?
Lie within the waters, lest you sink and forget where you came from. https://t.co/cJlObmLmjc"
5,"Stay curious, enjoy life and the vast expanses of the unknown, waiting for everyone that dares to look. 

Stay healthy in mind, stay flexible in thought - as each single thought could be the last thing your mind produces, before everything goes blank. https://t.co/BMWUG80l0O"

9,"I want to be able to work and create stuff as soon as possible. And I really hope that I don't have Long/Post Covid. According to my doctor, I have good chances at recovery. I just need patience. 

Approx. ~8 NFT bear markets and crashes lol.

10,"To y'all that wrote me DMs, Mails, and Discord Messages - I've have not seen them yet, I need some time to recover somehow. I only had my phone (and Mobile @MetaMask lol - thanks). Ironically, I was able to claim $SOS haha.

11,"And I'm so thankful that I did, otherwise I would have not been able to survive Covid. 
I'm now back at home. Still feeling groggy, short on breath, balancing problem, and light sensitivity (which is related to my underlying condition)

12,"A few weeks ago I got Covid, and since then it's been a rollercoaster and hell. I was at the hospital, at the ICU, back at normal care, back to the ICU. Almost recovered? Nope - back to square one.

Back then, I got my shots, which made me sick for a week. Best decision ever.
