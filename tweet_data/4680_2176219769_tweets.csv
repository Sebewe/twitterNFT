9,@kloss_eth @quicksiilver_ Idk seemed like the only people complaining are the ones not holding or the people saying they should have sold at 9 eth
10,"@quicksiilver_ @kloss_eth If their expectations were based of the art instead of the brand then they failed themselves cause its not a art based project. I dont like every trait but that doesnt mean I think anything less of the community, team, or brand"
11,@kloss_eth No art is perfect and if people thought they would like like all 8k of them they have over expectations. Especially with somthing like fashion it is impossible to have everyone like the same thing. To me the mint and reveal were amazing and capitalizes intention and diversity.
12,@quicksiilver_ @kloss_eth Its art... I could say the same about your pfp but everyone has their own taste
