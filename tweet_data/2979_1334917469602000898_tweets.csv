8,"@TaylorLorenz @ahcastor ""high intensive amount of capital to generate revenue"""
9,@kylieatwood am I the only person thinking this may escalate tensions as u.s maybe consulting on war matters and maybe smuggling in weapons? Isn’t that a bigger deal than they give him a satellite phone?

11,"@rabbithole_gg @anay_sim @chaserchapman @shibuyaxyz @CryptoSocietyS1 pls hold on spilling shibuya alpha frens, need to scoop one first"

18,@nassyweazy @crypto_coven!
19,@ddwchen * @SnapshotLabs enters chat
20,@cjsnft 💯 agree! Am not doing enough lol
21,@cjsnft that second episode was the best so many incredible moments
22,"@cr0ssETH @doodles ppl should have definitely read but for those that wrapped the NFTs, did the website prompt them or inform them in any way what that entailed? If not, I think that’s bad design on @doodles but still no excuses for not being informed!"
23,"@0xcarlisle 🤝🤝 this is as elite as it gets in crypto art, hope ppl sleep a little bit more so I can my hands on some passes"
24,"@theyoungcrews @madrealities @charmcgi @reegannotraygan we love (regan, regan) but need an NFT to vote 😢"

26,".@shibuyaxyz looks insane, hope I can mint a pass tomorrow in public."
27,@sonofalli wasn’t ready for this
28,@heytylr gm
29,@greatmando_nft meant *ust not Luna also!
30,"@greatmando_nft stablecoins like Luna &amp; Dai have a chance but it’s such a a huge gamble for countries to do so, you lose so much control over your country."
31,are we sure r*ssian oligarchs aren’t max bidding BTC &amp; ETH
32,"@mellmenati we understand, take care of yourself! don't worry about the collection, it will all be fine in the end. My prayers are with you and all Ukrainians!"
33,"@brdy_eth did you use wall anchors? if not, I am afraid you are not good fren"

37,"#NewNFTProfilePic caved, Jack &amp; his PMs finally got me https://t.co/UJqlanMGP6"
38,"@ATOK_mind think you tagged a scam IF Twitter, but it think they are gestating rn. I believe in the team, seem more business savvy and expect a lot more collaborations coming + low holders and collection which will change soon"
39,@cobie luna tokenomics stronk?
40,"@ATOK_mind azuki/clone x, would have said doodles two weeks ago. Also, ppl fudding invisible friends are going to be so historically wrong, they may be there in a few weeks"
41,"pfp collections are not art/vibes/memes they are businesses. When you launch one, you agree to enter a business relationship with your holders for the foreseeable future. Most founders aren’t good builders though, so I expect most will fail"
42,@AldenofSaturday @PeterMcCormack underrated comment. Empty carts are on a busy train are always a 🚩🚩🚩
43,"@tubbycatsnft @Tetranode @ratwell0x aidrop in my wallet for research purposes, trying to see something"
44,@sohrab hitting the hex &amp; seeing the animated version slaps too
45,i think @WGMInterfaces should sell their work to someone who is reputable and let them finish the project. They never promised anything besides the art and most ppl supported that decision because art was impeccable.
46,"@BrookeTansley @yourgrannies rooting for you guys, keeping track at what the gud ppl @madrealities are doing as well"
47,@grelysian @MarkTheHabibi 🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯

62,@spectatorindex RIP
63,@jameygannon 💯
64,@sentdefender happens all the time so nothing nefarious here unless Twitter says otherwise
65,@AmandaAAtherton @jbakes727 @Karnage420x @DimitrisDamian4 @WSBChairman which I think is what they are doing with Ukraine but this will never end as they will always be bordered by a NATO nation. So brings them back to point 1.
66,"@1kisfud Yes &amp; cyberattacks aimed at critical infrastructure, its truly unprecedented"
67,@NFTSTUDlOS rn dunkirk 😢
68,@DrifterNovel @crypto_coven @xuannu_eth peep the lovely witch
69,"@1kisfud It’s probably effective, just strange time this is being shared on Twitter for us all to consume"
70,💛💙….🕊
71,@anothercohen r you fucking kidding me @gregisenberg
72,i hate it here https://t.co/Z27QDPDzEU
73,the most disconcerting part of all of this is what China is scheming in the background. We are actively fighting two powerful nations now
74,@FonzGm if you put it that way
75,@DrifterShoots where is the lie?
76,@StG0331 @marcorubio he is on senate intelligence committee
77,it’s not looking great for Ukrainians am afraid https://t.co/u3GIdMiJ4T
78,they just attacked u*kraine while the un was holding an emergency sc meeting that’s wild to me
79,@gaelic_fash Y

90,345e bid for golden IF 👀👀👀
91,@ArmyDad_eth @ShadesOfYouNFT @opensea lilacs are great
92,"@melodypot @payrollstevie lore not floor, more of this!"
93,"@likesthejpegs am a certified degen and will absolutely know. Pls do this, sounds fun"
94,"pfp projects are just fundraising tools, the best founders are those that will allocate those funds properly. There is room for maybe 5 that will sustain themselves based on vibes &amp; memes alone, the chances that it is one of your jpegs are v slim"
95,@sjouk_ tail up goat &amp; reveler hour for the best food. Fun to walk at navy yard can grab food at salt line. For drinks vue rooftop &amp; Silver Lyan. Enjoy!
96,@tscarrithers 👀👀
97,thinking a pfp project can make a game from funds gen from mint revenue alone is your fault. Projects should focus more on creating lore/universes but it takes time and most won't do it. That's why am v bullish on the witches and woodies
98,@Fluffigans @ShadesOfYouNFT that’s my favorite trait
99,"these are easily some of my favorite NFTs I’ve ever purchased @ShadesOfYouNFT. No grand plans for these, just love the art https://t.co/DR2wnXVySn"
