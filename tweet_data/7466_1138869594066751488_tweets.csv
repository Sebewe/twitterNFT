1,these hit a high of 1.2 eth btw. a short story. The next call just got posted. Likely to see it follow the same trajectory as Toonz. https://t.co/nAHXM9iSdE
2,"The difference with the Studio 63 discord is that it doesn't post projects which *might* see a pump or go up by .03. 

When something is getting posted as alpha, it goes harddd. 

If you're not in you're missing out - https://t.co/gsxSUJJDFF https://t.co/tPc5kiITnE"
3,@nftceoclub sheeshhh
4,"that episode of euphoria was a work of art man. 

idk where to even start with the acting performances and the cinematography."
5,@JayGekkoNFT except from creepz😂
6,@JayGekkoNFT we in this together homie
7,the p2e gaming meta is about to kick off...
8,manchesters got vibes
9,"@DataNFT_ @dave_hopi Why I value yourself and your discord data. 

Always leading the way for inclusivity, kindness and authenticity in this space. 

big up 🤝"
10,"Damn I need to work on being more active lmaooo

Biggest alpha I got right now is @DegenToonz 
Clean af and refreshing artwork, simple Roadmap and vision, dedicated team. 

Likely to see these fly in a few days time."
11,"RT @vSamurai_NFT: vSamurai. A multi-stage Play and Earn Game &amp; NFT collection. Launching Soon. ⛩️

The first 1500 users who Like, RT &amp; Tag…"
12,do yourself a favour and read up and what they’re doing there. The price STILL doesn’t match the outcome of Roo Troop.
13,"i am genuinely just incredibly forgetful and often forget to post about a lot of projects i’m bullish on, especially friends / people I know, so before I forget this time - 

glad to see @RooTroopNFT getting the love it deserves. @MorganStoneee has built something real special 🤝"
14,"@StikTheDip roadmaps which are simple with a dedicated and hard-working team behind them are the key 🔑 

cba with roadmaps with 10+ useless deliverables"
15,"as always, eth down, nft’s up"
16,I smell a NFT bull run this week
17,@MorganStoneee @RooTroopNFT nice
18,doodle mfers will probably launch their twitter in about 24 hours
19,mfers meta incoming
20,"I probably get about 20+ WL opportunities a month, and usually i’ll mint about 1-3. 

Using that method above, it’s very rare to find a project that has no ‘cracks’"
21,"do everything you can to obtain WL for projects then once you have it, try to be as negative as possible  when assessing the project and see what potential problems / cracks it might have. 

based on that, make your decision whether to mint or not🤝"
22,@JayGekkoNFT @SeanSemola 🥰
23,this aged ... well https://t.co/lKg6WwQd8e
24,@DataNFT_ Authentic not Fake :)
25,"@NFTLlama it’s hard to find a team as dedicated as you guys in this space

in an industry when we’re told to bet on teams not art, this is the safest bet you can make :)"
26,NFT drama is unrivalled
27,"been watching a bunch of documentaries such as the kanye west one, the defiant ones etc. and i’m starting to spot a trend

the most successful people have failed the most"
28,@YatMuseum nice doggo 🥺
29,@DataNFT_ @ethaflam can also be a painful process lmao
30,"if they’re focusing on producing and distributing music through NFT &amp; web3 technology then i’m all here for it

but if they’re just putting any NFT’s through death row.... idk. would hate to see it’s legacy tarnished"
31,"Snoop making Death Row Records an NFT label? 

idk how to feel on that"
32,@OzarkNFT gm
33,sometimes I feel like collectively as a space we’ve all glossed over the fact that Facebook (The 6th Largest company in the world) rebranded itself as Meta and is set to focus mostly on web3
34,^ There’s your next token airdrop idea
35,"crazy how much NFT’s rely on discord. 

There needs to be a new programme / social media like discord, but purely designed for Web3 / NFT’s"
36,"@JackDHurd been looking at it these past 20 minutes and tbh theres a hell of a lot of red flags. Teams smart and knows what they’re doing. 

+ not to mention that the project is actually a derivative of doodles lmao, they’re literally copying traits from there."
37,"founding multiple NFT projects is a red flag - just shows the founders aren’t working on something they’ve believed in for a while, shows they’re just chasing a trend and trying to secure a bag. 

personally i’d stay away from cereal club imo"
38,looking forward to coming back to this in 12 hours and seeing how wrong i was
39,gonna be interesting to see some prices after superbowl - honestly recon we don’t see much of a pump after as I think it’s already been hyped up a lot for NFT’s
40,the amount of simping that goes on in the NFT space is actually wild lmaooo
41,gas is low and theres no degen plays going about :(
42,I give it 6 days until doodle karafuru’s launch
43,"the transition to p2e from pfp in NFT’s is fully underway for this month. Probably see a rotation back into pfp’s in 1-2 months time.

I tweet about raidparty a lot but @YetiTownNFT is a great project with a lower price barrier to get into. 

going to pop off soon."
44,i will shamelessly shill and rt anything if it guarantees me a murakami flower.
45,"accumulating raidparty heroes during this dip of shortsighted and wrong founded fud

valhalla next?"
46,"i’ve shilled raidparty for months and will continue doing so.

once the game finally releases, and holders start taking huge profits will people realise that this is the best passive income provider of all NFT’s. 

+ the game is sick"
47,sad to see some people get drunk with power in this space.
48,"@KarafuruNft &amp; @chain_runners are the best i’ve seen. 

@ExpansionPunks is also up there. 

makes such a huge difference imo"
49,normalise fun minting processes
50,"2 hours of waiting on RaidParty mint and I still had to buy on secondary

nice"
51,"everytime I see the mainstream media and society making fun and laughing at how ‘useless’ NFT’s are, I always think back to the interview with Bill Gates when he was laughed at for trying to explain the internet"
52,"I'm willing to stand by project founders who make mistakes and then act on them to reverse any damage that's happened. 

But one thing I will not stand for is pure lies by project founders. However big or small. 

Beepos straight up lied on multiple points. i'm out."
53,@NFTFeverDream For sure and suchc an important point. It’s usually impossible to call what moons. For every missed opportunity theres another. Mental health above everything.
54,"this is amazing

and so so needed. https://t.co/L7yC1VE9XP"
55,"every time you miss out on a project that 10x, or see people getting a mint that instantly sells for 2eth+ use it as an oppurtunity to better yourself. 

make it push you harder. 
make it make you better. 
make it make you succeed."
56,everywhere i look i see azuki derivatives
57,"Atari NFT go vroom vroom. 

.28 seemed like a steal. Time will tell."
58,👀 https://t.co/JdSc6xKmlC
59,@JayGekkoNFT u just came here to flex your bebe :/
60,"bull run times like these make me realise how bad the NFT market really was from Oct - Dec. 

And the craziest thing is that even still in that bear run there were multiple projects that could 2x, 5x, even 100x (wolf game) your initial investment. 

the NFT space is unrivalled."
61,@DiscoverXnft it’s been too long since a non-derivative stealth mint :(
62,@tangodog89 @NFTLlama @SpaceYetisNFT nice crown👀
63,"the old xPunk pfp needed a little refresh so went with my @SpaceYetisNFT 

ty for the alpha @NFTLlama https://t.co/k5Ifombl8l"
64,"shoutout to @EthaliensNFT team &amp; @ArtMcArty 

Hardworking team, smooth minting process and so much more to come. 

Looking forward to copping this guy in the metaverse👀 https://t.co/Z4QpnfPbAb"

MINT the Public Sale in 10 MINUTES:…"
68,public sale for raidparty gonna be realll interesting
69,people will say it’s stupid / pointless buying NFT’s then will literally buy a tik tok dance on fortnite
70,"always makes me laugh when theres people who's NFT pfp matches EXACTLY how they talk in discord / on twitter. 

Unexplainable but funny"
71,"no engagement farming tweets, no jumping through a million hoops for WL - just a simple release with simple WL objectives."
72,"fishy fam feels like the same setup and release as NFT projects back in 2021 summer - september. 

and man it feels good to see that kind of release style again 😌"
73,"i know i've tweeted a bunch of times about raidparty but genuinely this is the most bullish i've been on a single project ever. 

teams execution is THE best I have seen in this space. 

raidparty is blue-chip material. i'm going all in."
74,@FuFangchu soon
75,@JayGekkoNFT @ArtMcArty @OgScummers absolutely legendary 🔥
76,"wow

all my bags are... pumping?"
77,".125 when mentioned. 
.3 and flyinggg now.

Reveal tomorrow.
Unknown when roll out of game - I’m guessing about 2 weeks max. 

There’s still so much room for this to grow. https://t.co/qC2mKyHji9"
78,@powerglove_eth @ExpansionPunks I love this design style! Your work?
79,"Picked up 3 @YetiTownNFT's 

Extremely bullish. There's more than meets the eye with the Yeti's."
80,@DataNFT_ excellent news !
81,"the meta right now:

p2e games with the art of generative 10k pfp collections - An NFT that provides the art / pfp aspect of NFT’s as well as the full utility of a game. 
e.g. Creepz &amp; Oogaverse. 

Any project that can offer these two main attributes will FLY."
82,"pay attention to the projects that see rises without any influencers help, backing or even holding."
83,@B3nj4min_ETH did the devs do something?
84,@JayGekkoNFT me going away for the weekend 🤝 significant events happening in the NFT space
85,"been away for a couple of days, what did i miss?"

96,"Running a little poll out of general interest to see what mint prices people perceive as being cheap, middle (usual) and expensive and where they start to differentiate one from another. 

got some boundaries I expect but interested to see everyones take :)"
97,@NFTLlama congrats man🎉 the days with the mayc pfp and the few thousand followers seems like a lifetime ago now😂
98,"@DiscoverXnft oh god
