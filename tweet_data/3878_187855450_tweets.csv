Today I will make next work for NAMEchain collection with @Raskalov and @pobedeen names.
I’m a little bit nervous coz it wouldn’t be just writing and requires quite special requisite.
Hope everything goes well."

2,@mjkare @pobedeen Thanx Serdar! 🤝
3,"@JivoePero @pobedeen That's exactly what inspires me the most! 🤝
Thanx Svyat!"
4,@darklunni There is no excuse for this. I can't even imagine how our propaganda will try to justify it.
5,"I'm especially pleased to see when people catch the idea. 
And Kirill is just such a person.

NAMEchain collection is a neverending sequence of names, which always involves new people in interaction. You don't just collect this particular work, you affect the next one. 🔥 https://t.co/FhILVmCaVt"

18,"Guys, the best way to support me in what I'm doing right now is to collect some of my NFTs. 

Especially now when normal life collapsed and my main work was canceled.

This one is from the NAMEchain collection. Check also pixel art collection called HIDE.

21,@BlockGeekDima 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
22,What the fuck is going in my country that people should take actions like THAT to separate themselves from SHAME for this sick and ridiculous decision to invade in Ukraine?🇺🇦 https://t.co/NOBHyNOUbU

27,"@andrei_chino 20:00 по Москве
Точнее на плашке спейса показано в твоем часовом поясе"
28,@Re1st_Art Он часового пояса зависит. По Москве это 27-го в 20:00
29,@OTivuel Вот как раз такая информация нужна. А в связи с чем усложнили?
30,"@Re1st_Art Для иллюстрации интересно, конечно!"
31,"@Alex_Uki Пока, вроде, и из Москвы есть рейсы туда. Разве нет?"
32,@Re1st_Art А раньше особо некуда. Спейс уже завтра.
33,@eeee98003635 Все примут. От тебя зависит.
34,@eeee98003635 Пока еще летают самолеты
35,@AirbagAnn класс! ждем! 🙏
36,"Друзья, на воскресенье был анонсирован спейс о жизни NFT художников в других странах.

Он состоится, но из-за последних событий тему немного подкорректируем. 

Теперь хочется поговорить конкретнее — куда и как можно переехать прямо сейчас. Нужен ваш опыт.

все, чье мнения я уважаю, сегодня не могут найти себе места"
45,@SergeyMF @darklunni Я боюсь представить эту атмосферу ожидания и неизвестности. 🙏
46,"@EBelitsa Пушкинская площадь в этом смысле ужасное для оценки количества участников место. Саму площадь в момент перекрывают и остаются узкие тротуары и по обоим сторонам от Тверской бульвары, которые уходят вниз.

Для акции у которой НЕ БЫЛО организаторов сегодня было очень много людей!"
47,"@alikolomichenko Это меньшее, что мы можем сделать. Но и не так много у нас осталось инструментария. https://t.co/fPe3yfc9nb"
48,"@DeinaTymur вам сил! хочется верить, что скоро это все закончится ✊"
49,"@pobedeen я думаю, еще больше мы потеряем, когда/если эти ""воины"" вернуться домой с этой доблестной операции
как можно будет жить рядом с такими людьми я не могу представить вообще"
50,@tchebotarev 💯и бесконечно стыдно сука!
51,"Сейчас я иду спать и за моим окном спокойно.

А в это время мои друзья из Киева, люди с которым мы вот только на днях могли безмятежно обсуждать пленочную фотографию, сторителлинг, аппаратные кошельки, NFT и прочее — прямо сейчас боятся лечь спать.

И этому нет оправдания. 🇺🇦"
52,Now even MORE people!
53,"UPD: it was an hour ago
Very slow Internet connection here."

Looks like a procession has begun. https://t.co/qBFocm8qmj"

57,RT @VitalikButerin: Очень расстроен решением Путина отказаться от возможности мирного решения спора с Украиной и вместо этого начать войну.…
58,@fungibles3 Yes man. It a heavy strike on our own people
59,"🇺🇦The worst thing is that when such terrible events occur, all your usual activities seem out of place.

Especially if you create something. Let’s find the way to support each other. 🙏❤️"
60,"@Yakim_1987 Not sure that this is the right move.

Believe me there are a lot of people in Russia who are agains Putin, lies, wars and all this bullshit. We went for meetings, voted against this corrupted authorities and feel shame about every action this mad grandfather did."
61,"GM💫
to everyone who also wish this madness will be stopped ASAP💙💛"
62,"@Raskalov Nope! In Ulan-Ude you was with a bunch of Toyotas, not Defenders 😂"
63,@Raskalov Ah.. what if you stoped drinking and learned NFTs approx in July… or when we done the roadtrip?)
64,@teryoshi ✊✊✊

68,@anna_mikhe @teryoshi 👍it remains only to earn enough ETH to grab it)
69,@egor_shirinskii Thanx Egor! You are so supportive as always!)
70,"5/ Let me know how do you like this type of posts with a selection of works, which I would buy? 🙏

The next one will be soon!"
71,"4/ As a more affordable alternative, I would choose this photo of Nikita from another collection. 
And for just 0.33 ETH!

https://t.co/gZvdETj6iY https://t.co/cRnbLoCoEV"
72,"3/ I find Nikita's feelings of color, composition, and light extremely accurate and skilled. 

Also, Nikita has wide representation in the offline — various exhibitions and publications in mass media.

The quite high floor price as result. But I'm sure it is absolutely worth it. https://t.co/Qw7UDlWUs6"
73,"2/ A collection of 12 photos captures various weapons exhibitions around the world. Love the story which Nikita tells in every photo. Whether it's a cup of coffee between rockets, faceless characters, or a man routinely putting an RPG shell in a closet.

https://t.co/4QB36JpfQl"
74,"1/ The first piece I would like to have in my collection as a #virtualNFTcollector is this one.

Number 4 from ""Nothing personal"" collection of Nikita Teryoshin @teryoshi. Approx 1.25 ETH.

And here's why 👇 https://t.co/wRxI3M62zN"
75,@darklunni GM can not be late on Twitter) you are always on time!
76,"@Raskalov Nice that you guys make this as a project. Not just selling jpgs — with goals, additional values and your beliefs. This makes it very exciting to look on your progress! ✊"
77,@nikallynas Optimistic level is optimal) just feel how it goes naturally and correct actions in this way
78,"@nikallynas ))
Plan as sequence of expectations that probably would not happen"
79,@AnnettNailArt Think you mean guys)
80,@withalexmazurov For sure! Also good to be flexible on the path and make it with no extra pressure
81,"@pobedeen Thanx, Kirill! Same to you! ✊"
82,"@AndronovaAnna Давай, конечно!"
83,"GM 💫
to everyone who keep going with or without plan"
84,@Art_e_quine 🙌Расскажешь про переезд на спейсе?
85,https://t.co/ZREF7DweOW
86,👇to capture the moment
87,"@teryoshi @withFND Love it! 
For some reason, I definitely prefer photos that are mostly dark or without negative space."
88,@saturnial Coming updates?)
89,@art_no_mad @djngoma Класс! Поделишься на спейсе?
90,"@koodri_art Впечатляющие цифры!)
А на какой платформе?"
91,@supremeoutsider Будет круто послушать про Великобританию!
92,"@Re1st_Art Спасибо! Делаю то, к чему у самого сейчас явный интерес. Мб поэтому)
Если захочешь рассказать про Бангкок на спейсе — кидай запрос!)"
93,"@anna_mikhe @bresolart Thank you, Anna! See what will happen)"
94,@pobedeen 🙏think it will be useful for everyone
95,@nipetrov omg. how is it possible?)
96,"@bresolart Thanx, Vika!"
97,"That's why I ask my friends to excuse me in advance)

Here I'll also share why I find a particular artwork or artist noteworthy. 

This approach ables me to spotlight artists, I'm passionate about. And deepen my expertise in the field.

The first post will be tomorrow! 😍"
98,"Crucially important — I'll show you artworks which I would definitely buy if I had enough ETH.

To make it clear I suggest using the Proof of Purchase method 😀

That means in case you send me the exact amount of ETH I’ll buy the artwork, rather than withdraw funds or something."
99,"🔥Let me introduce the concept of my #virtualNFTcollector column.

Being in the NFT world for a while makes me believe that I have enough expertise to collect artworks.

I don't have enough resources for doing this for real rn, but that wouldn't stop me from sharing my selection."
