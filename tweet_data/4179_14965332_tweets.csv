1,"HT @matt_levine, from his latest dispatch: 

Possessing NFTs on the blockchain is not the same thing as ownership of that property, though it is an important indicator of ownership. (Just as possessing a bicycle is generally a good sign that you own it, but not definitive proof.)"
2,"Lots of “I’s” in here. Then, “no creative agency would have done this work.” Then, “oh I guess a creative agency did do it, but I’m not going to give them credit - we’re all one team, right?” 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/hF3YHX11Mm"

15,@Degentraland @doodles 👆 this
16,@seyitaylor @soundxyz_ @join_royal Sure. Put simply: I decided I wanted to buy a music NFT so I joined a bunch of @soundxyz_ listening parties and discovered I really liked @whoinvitedgrady. I missed the primary sale but eventually contributed to his @viamirror crowdfund and now I stream on Spotify daily.
17,"@seyitaylor Hmm… while I agree with you in broad strokes, I see that speculation can (a) help with discovery - this has happened to me twice now with @soundxyz_ drops, and (b) turn casual fans into super fans - like I’m about to be when this Nas track drops on @join_royal today :-)"
