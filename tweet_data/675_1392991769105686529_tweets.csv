89,"@JamieGeorge93 @ButtonheadV @lacras_eth @BoredApeYC I think it would be fun if there was functional utility to spending $APE based off of what you own. Like, you have to have a dog as a companion to spend in the #BAYC ecosystem or find someone with a dog to validate and they get part of the fees. Stuff like that."
