15,@vitoTK Absolutely man anything but these .2 + mints
16,PSA to founders: Pricing your mint above .1 adds a ton of risk to holders. It reduces the potential upside and is significantly less likely to mint out.

43,"@konop @StarcatchersNFT @doodles I’m okay with no roadmap tbh; give me the details on the founders. Who are they, and why is it important this project works out. And I’ll gladly place my bets. But, unfortunately, if this is a trend it won’t be utilized in this way."

64,@Rb430Cool @coolcatsnft Do you think if the game flops it will hurt the long-term credibility and potential?

67,@itsjoeyc_ @coolcatsnft Lol 🤣
68,Thinking I may pickup a @coolcatsnft prices have cooled abit. I wish they hadn’t tied their value to a token. These always worry me. Anyone have arguments for them/against? Long term. Don’t care about the delays.
