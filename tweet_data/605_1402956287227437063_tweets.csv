10,"@remusofmars @Abraham_L_L @chainlink @FantomFDN @0xPolygon @coinbase @0xredwood @DermanCapital @brettpalatiello @proof_xyz PROOF has way too much of a speculative value rn, but it does have a potential to become an ""elite"" closed group of holders/builders if the right people decide to get involved -&gt; hence the ""speculative"" value."
11,"@remusofmars @Abraham_L_L @chainlink @FantomFDN @0xPolygon @coinbase @0xredwood @DermanCapital @brettpalatiello @proof_xyz BAYC is indeed at a quite high price to worth the investment atm.

I haven't checked mfers much, but they don't feel like something important. So I'm curious to hear why you put them on par with punks as your 2 preferred choices."

14,"@0xredwood @Abraham_L_L @chainlink @FantomFDN @0xPolygon @coinbase @DermanCapital @brettpalatiello @remusofmars @ReidarDao I agree with the rationale. However, the ""excuse"" I'd give (only) to ADA is that the more thorough and principled a scientific approach, the more time is required to deliver.

I do agree though that Charles is overdoing it, to the point that he risks of losing the race."
15,"@0xredwood @Abraham_L_L @chainlink @FantomFDN @0xPolygon @coinbase @DermanCapital @brettpalatiello @remusofmars @ReidarDao However, @Abraham_L_L had rule (2), that you wouldn't be able to touch them for 3y. Probably enough time for both ADA to deliver as well as for ETH2.0's arrival. And with a definite bear before the end of the 3y period, I'd probably be equally concerned buying SOL and MATIC now!"
16,@Abraham_L_L @chainlink @FantomFDN @0xPolygon @coinbase @0xredwood @DermanCapital @brettpalatiello @remusofmars Definitely interested to hear more about this!
17,"@Abraham_L_L @chainlink @FantomFDN @0xPolygon @coinbase - ADA because of its (potential) African continent monopoly, but also mostly because of the strong belief I have in Charles Hoskinson's very principled scientific approach.

P.S.: I'm an amateur enthusiast/researcher, so there's definitely more depth to be explored."
18,"@Abraham_L_L @chainlink @FantomFDN @0xPolygon @coinbase Now why DOT &amp; ADA?

- DOT because it has a quite unique character/direction, as ""the blockchain of blockchains"", or the ""Google of Blockchains"" and any competitor (which there isn't really) is way far behind. Also because Gavin Woods."
19,"@Abraham_L_L @chainlink @FantomFDN @0xPolygon @coinbase With ETH2's arrival, I'm not sure if SOL &amp; MATIC's (current &amp; announced) features are unique enough to make them thrive. They'll definitely stay alive of course.

All this is assuming ETH2.0 is not going to be sooo late that they actually manage to get strongly established."
20,"@Abraham_L_L @chainlink @FantomFDN @0xPolygon @coinbase I think that both SOL and MATIC solve mostly short- and medium- term issues and are seen almost exclusively as ETH competitors / ETH1 issue solvers. On top of that SOL is particularly centralized, kinda going against the whole web3 spirit - a reason it might not last long."
21,@0xDamien @fvckrender 😂
22,@Abraham_L_L @chainlink @FantomFDN @0xPolygon @coinbase So yes to SOL and MATIC but no to DOT and ADA? Care to elaborate? I'm personally way more bullish on the 2 you left out. Agree on LINK and FTM though.

I guess we call it ""alpha"" here in the NFT Space."
38,"@BoredArmoYC @Loopifyyy But what you're saying is very far off. Just check how similar the original art is to CC.

""Inspired"" is different than ""blatant stealing"".

P.S.: I said ""at least"". And the point here is that there is no way they'll compensate properly the original artist in the end."
39,"@BoredArmoYC @Loopifyyy Lol, hah. You can't seriously believe all measurements of all features were an accident...

But yes, they can indeed make it right. Give her at least 15% of the original sales, plus 2.5% of all royalties so far and we're cool.

Will they do it? No fucking way."
