83,@FuegoApps @TheMiamiApe @BadBananaNFT In that case I'm going shopping for more
84,@FuegoApps @TheMiamiApe @BadBananaNFT Isn't @BadBananaNFT getting some utility added soon?
85,@Chiefy65 @3lueninja That's pretty much our plan right now. Everyone is still of grinding for a WL and stealth drops reduce gas fees. We're still early in the process and things may change but it's the plan for now.
86,@Chiefy65 @3lueninja Think a stealth drop would be a good way to go?
87,@Legend @diverse So you're saying we should go all in
