9,"6) Tips

a) Dont cry if you sell and a project moons - you sold based on the educated info you had at that time and you cant predict extrinsic future events

b) Dont be afraid to exit... HARD

c) Learn over time, dont overcommit or you will get burnt

d) FIND FRIENDS = a MUST"
10,"5) Tools

Give up on OpenSea for trackin volume

Invest in analytic tools to outperform the market consistently, it will change your whole experience.

Listed by quality (in my experience):

a. NFTNerds 
b. Moby gg
c. icy tools
d. nansen
e. many others i havent used (smaller)"
11,"4) Analytics

Volume is your best friend and your worst enemy

NFTs = illiquid marketplace, can be 20 sales per minute to 3 in a blink due to FUD/dumps

Track collection listings relative to sales volume to assess price trend direction

Over time you will learn graph patterns"
12,"3) Managing Exposure

Ok. The mint ticks boxes, now to throw your ETH at it. 

If the mint is purely based on factors of 1)a.b.c. Do not throw all of your liquidity into it. Keep it to 10-20% of your holdings at hard MAX

If you believe in the project, act to your own discretion"
13,"2) Team/Council

You CANNOT do this alone. No matter how good you think that you are, you WOULD be performing better with increased perspective and guidance from peers

If you are not already in one, create a private group with friends (irl/web3) and discuss quality of mint"
14,"1) Market Awareness

The NFT market is a dynamic stream of constant opportunity and threat to your liquidity

Identify good mints through assessing 
a. Holder Count
b. Mint Speed
c. Meta-correlation
d. Smart wallet tracking
e. Intrinsic belief of project quality *optional* 😂"
