13,"If an artist develops the visual foundation of an NFT project they should be offered no less than 20%. The artwork is what builds hype before anything is even minted. If the roadmap is never delivered, the art still exists. It’s the only part of a project that isn’t speculative."

15,Gm everyone. But especially to Melania Trump who just learned that the blockchain doesn’t lie. https://t.co/4cLxpuZm9t

18,@RUFF_DRAFT Meeting nice people. Learning from smart people. Being inspired by talented people. 🤙
19,@betty_nft Still love the Hyena the most! But the Wolf and Lizard are both fire too.
20,First thing I've minted in over a week. So stoked on my species—can't wait for reveal. #deadfrenz #DeadFellaz https://t.co/8efNPqlKkM
21,@RUFF_DRAFT gm!
22,"@CodyBakerrrr Recently had a client (after a couple rounds of my suggested color palettes), give me the exact colors they wanted. So I changed everything and the next call was all about how much they hated the new colors and asked why I changed them… 🙄🤷‍♂️"
23,Gm! Great thread to start your day. https://t.co/PnpRWyUNC0
24,@CodyBakerrrr More content like this please.
25,@cassthenomad @CodyBakerrrr High key it also sounds very good.

28,gm to everyone who watched sports ball so that I could go grocery shopping in an empty store on a Sunday night. You are appreciated.
29,@CodyBakerrrr 🔥 as always! 🙌
30,@chimerapillars @toddlerpillars So excited for these. All my bebehs need chimera frens. 🙌
31,@allisonbamcat Just schedule them go out at that time. Make them think you’re burning the midnight oil while you’re busy catching Zzzs.

45,@ohhshiny Did he just describe Capitalism and blame it on NFTs?
46,@kristophershinn Yes! Straight to the bone.
47,@toddlerpillars @chimerapillars Is that a Lou Ferrigno pickle!?
48,@kristophershinn That basketball hoop image takes me back to my snowy midwest childhood. I don't miss that cold. 😅
49,@mchltckr Love this! Old cars are the best.
50,@Parpok206 @noahkalina They monetize it. Mentioning me and my website doesn’t give you the right to sell ads beside my work.
51,@allisonbamcat Top right and bottom left. 🙌
52,@thebenjaverse @CoolmanUniverse My favorite one I’ve seen.
53,@quave_eth 💯 I can’t even bother. It’s exhausting. It makes me lose interest and support in projects I was previously hype about.
54,@CodyBakerrrr Can you even get engagement anymore on IG without paying for it?
55,@coreywolfen Same. Looks like you’ve got a hybrid fren coming your way!

58,@nft_papi Story of the year 🤙😎
59,@NFTBuffet I lasted 10 minutes. It’s interesting so many people here are only just hearing about it. All my normie friends were sharing it with vigor more than a week ago as definitive proof that they are right.
60,@seanbonner Don’t tease me.
61,"@Rustyrash2 @seanbonner Same. But since I can’t live in Tokyo right now, there’s no place I’d rather be than LA."

84,Soaring past 15eth on the way to space with @doodles today. 🚀
85,"I’ve been trying to wrap my head around these projects that have 3-5eth+ floors before reveal and within a week are 10-15eth+. Meanwhile projects like Doodles, Deadfellaz, Smilesss , etc take weeks to move a fraction of that.

Different market? Different utility? Bigger hype?"

96,"@MarkHthomas @doodles Doodles are one of the few collections where I think rarity barely matters—unless it’s a super rare, like icecream, balloon, pickle, etc. All the others are based on a vibe check for the owner. 🤙"
97,@KyleLCottrell @jeffexcell Yes. Capturing a moment doesn’t alway mean you know the story behind it. And that’s totally fine.
98,I love this. 100% https://t.co/DeCK0hDFYt
99,@cozywyatt That’s some tasty icecream.
