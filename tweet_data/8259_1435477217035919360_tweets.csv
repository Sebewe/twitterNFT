41,"@wackyverse @cryptoadzNFT I appreciate the thoughtful response. Was hoping I didn’t come across annoying but it’s been tough watching my other communities take off (mayc, clonex, kongz, etc) - I’m prolly just pissed I bought mine at 6eth lol"
42,"@wackyverse @cryptoadzNFT Toadz have fallen off big time… I’m not saying there isn’t development happening, hopefully the team is working hard. But our (I’m a holder) overall relevance and how much it seems we are in the “blue chip” mix has plummeted :("
