24,@_LoneWolf3 Not a cash grab. Very little money in the Tw Blue subscription for this. A feature like this needs to be rolled out to a controlled group to manage and test. One of the Tw Blue features is getting early access to these type of rollouts. This will be available to all.

30,I want to buy so much ETH right now. But I’ll most definitely immediately spend it on NFTs. Maybe just like 3eth?
31,@SoyGuzzi Nice
32,@Key_Yeti @smwise55 @Twitter It’s purely due to Twitter Blue rollout in those countries. This is only for early access at the moment so I’d expect full rollout in the not too distant future.

62,"@jnuno Yeah I was surprised. John’s glasses have been undervalued for a few weeks, now they’re where they should be. One of my favourite traits."
63,@IanTCaldwell @creatureNFT @dannycoleee I honestly don’t get it. Hopefully because only people who are in it for the long haul are buying now.
64,"gm #FaMorie! Under 150 mories to 3ETH floor. And there are a few gems in there, including a halo and an admiral. I might add one more 🤩"
65,@dannycoleee 💙 grateful for you and the work you’re doing!
66,@metamorie @CryptoMories Do you sleep? Or do those cyclops glasses exempt you from this?
