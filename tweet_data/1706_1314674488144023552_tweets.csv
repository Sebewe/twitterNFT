that means writing code to work with arbitrary ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 contracts.

my co-builder @AdamLeeBG likes the cats, and I like the mfers.

35,"1. Trades within an NFT community.

At the moment, there's a ~2 ETH difference in the price of these apes.

If the owners of these 2 apes identify more with the other's ape, NiftySwap let's them trade apes directly, without:

- making any sales
- unsafe escrowing of NFTs https://t.co/9vt53y9CW1"
36,"In @thirdweb_'s first ever hack week, I reignited an old idea -- NiftySwap.

Create a basket of ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens, and trade it for another basket of tokens that you want.

Cool, but what problems does this solve❓"
37,"@AzukiZen floor: ~10 ether
@coolcatsnft floor: ~8.5 ether
