93,"LOL I’m done with twitter for the day and it’s only 8:40 AM. Will check back in after my shift, I’m sure I’ll be less energetic after 8 hours of clinical thinking."
94,@DiamondDanny21 @creatureNFT *then the tweet wasn’t aimed at you. Not aimed. Apologies.
95,"@DiamondDanny21 @creatureNFT You’re proving my point that you’re hurt. Like how do you not see this? If you love the art and don’t care about the floor then the tweet it aimed at you, but since you’re coming in hot and all Karen like over it, it innately implies you’re hurt about the situation as well."
96,@DiamondDanny21 I did not make an assumption about everyone lol I said I saw people hurt on twitter over the floor price and insinuated that if you love the art you shouldn’t bitch about the floor. That targets a subsection of @creatureNFT the ~6k owners. Not all you mfs.
97,@DiamondDanny21 Bro I said I saw hella people hurt about the floor dropping. If you love the art then why do you care about the floor? You’re here getting all twisted about a tweet. A simple statement of truth. You literally are proving my point. And furthermore I can tell your bag is hurt.
98,"@DiamondDanny21 LOL not trying to fuck with your bag, so I hope I’m wrong, but not giving me any context as to your conviction ain’t helping, I’m open to discussion, but good luck and gm ser. https://t.co/soe9o85KHn"
