I have been a huge fan for a long time and this is so cool! Only in NFTs could this happen lol https://t.co/lyJZrENy60

8,"@Jdotcolombo I have a team that can do anything needed in the backend (smart contract, art generation , web3 mint site etc)"
9,@jackieayran It really can. Reach out if you need anything or just to chat.
10,@SakataOddjob @Pizza_Later
11,@Flynnjamm Right now it's just answering a lot of the same questions over and over lol
12,@NudeYogaGirl GM
13,@0xEvol @SurrealApes @nftgerry that's dope. @nftgerry is amazing with these!
14,@CryptoStorm__ That's awesome! Me and a few other apes have a zoom call at least once a month trying to onboard new people. We want to start expanding it. Let us know if you want to compare notes or if we can help you in any way.

16,@BoredApeAF oh nice! You are doing great
17,"RT @MeatCubesNFT: JOIN THE MEAT CUBES FAM! 
If you are looking for quality art and amazing Meaty art airdrops this is the project for you 🤗…"
18,@Pizza_Later Thank you. Just another buzzword for projects to try and get people to buy in.
19,@BoredApeAF left if you can it's a bit pricey now but there will be a coin airdrop soon. Snapshot is the 28th
20,@BoredApeAF you need to get yourself some land my brother.
21,@KrayTrain @BennaginsEth
22,@ImliterallyETH Happy Birthday!
23,@economist Happy Birthday!!!
24,"@CapetainTrippy @NizzyNFT @ThaLastDJ It's not official but 
https://t.co/pWdk8SEkBl"
25,@ImliterallyETH Its fine lol once they learn not to use them in public you are golden. There are some very comical moments where they use swears in such perfect context. Brings some real joy to tough days lol
26,@ApeStar_824 @quirkiesnft Oh yes have 3. https://t.co/DsvQeMBWSo
27,@ApeStar_824 @quirkiesnft Such a good one!
28,@JWeb777 @dannycoleee That's too fucked up. Thank you @JWeb777 for calling them out.

37,@NathanHeadPhoto Scared money don't make money.
38,@SEECRITS How many think this is true https://t.co/2vwxtyhY5b
39,GM happy 2sday! Its really fun to think about. Also in the year 2222 2/22 falls on a Friday so naturally ours is better lol
40,@Schagwelll @nftworldsNFT That is not a lot left!!!
41,"@GoBigBlue_RP @creatureNFT uhhh amazing! Thank you, don't tell my wife how much this cost."
42,@GoBigBlue_RP @creatureNFT I want a creature for that sweater!
43,"@the_freightrain Yes why build a community on a copy when you could build a community on an original idea. Mfers are doing great, slappy seals are doing great. Just build something. It's more work but you will be rewarded much more and respected more in the community."
44,@GratefulApe_eth The first one through the wall always gets a little bloody.
45,@mxnnft @quirkiesnft @carsonturner Sorry you got it stolen. There are a lot of scams make sure you are educating yourself. Also @carsonturner is amazing!
46,"@bayc0000 @quirkiesnft @skuxxverse I got some @quirkiesnft but have not picked up a @skuxxverse. I did get a few @BadBabyDinosNFT. I think they both build on @nftworldsNFT 
#bullishonthemetaverse"
47,"Evening GM, had too much fun with my son today."
48,@StonedBrody what's her mmr?
49,@bryanbrinkman You know your audience! Amazing lok
50,@megafraggergm @BoredApeYC https://t.co/F9KcshiSVh
51,@FFVV1211 it directly appeals to our degeness lol
52,@NudeYogaGirl GM
53,@NoKapRich @ohhshiny @StevenACohen2 Yeah no worries. I have no bad feelings towards @ohhshiny at all. From what I have seen it's all positive for the space as well.
54,@LooksRareNFT Now I won't have to go to another site to look these up! Keep improving. You're doing great!
55,@NoKapRich @ohhshiny @StevenACohen2 I mean at most you can see the type of person he chooses to do business with. With access to billions of dollars you could manipulate small cap coins or full NFT collections. I this it's more informational as just a heads up instead of a witch hunt.
56,@NoKapRich It's not @ohhshiny it's another cofounder of DIGITAL. @StevenACohen2 because I thought that too but looking at the wiki he was born in the 1950's and Ohhshiny looks younger than me lol
57,@RumbleKongs looks good ... wen tophat!
58,"@bayc0000 @JWeb777 Yes! Brothers! @JWeb777 , glad to have found you."
59,"GM, love the bullishness on metaverse projects."

63,@metastash I agree. I was on all day everyday
64,Late in the day GM! Its crazy how fast things move in this space!
65,@rafagrassetti @garyvee why do I love this?
66,5000 followers! One of my goals achieved! Thank you all! I love my NFT Twitter fam.
67,@hypnotizedApe @Cents2Sats haha good point!
68,@bayc0000 @YatMuseum Yes! only 1 good eye between the both of us lol
69,@hypnotizedApe @Cents2Sats That's amazing. They probably used up all their luck for the next 5 years lol
70,@hypnotizedApe @Cents2Sats Wow those are 2 amazing apes next to each other. Imagine minting 2 and getting those!
71,@YatMuseum @bayc0000 Right and we only found each other on twitter.
72,@YatMuseum Hrm that is a really good point. I think of @bayc0000 a brother because we match similar traits!
73,"GM! Do you ever wonder who your NFT neighbors are? For BAYC my ape token id is 1244 so is 1243 or 1245 out there?!?! 
Does anyone else know their neighbors?"
74,GM! being vigilant on what you mint is becoming more important than ever. We went from last year 1 or 2 mints a week to 12 - 15 a day! You time is a finite resource. Back projects that you believe in and is worth your time.

76,"@osf_nft So many things are escapes from IRL problems. Books, movies , video games and napping so you don't have to deal with anything."

85,@metastash Almost perfect it needed to hit a corner lol
86,Who is ready for two teams to battle it out. Some great commercials and an amazing half time show!
87,@RobNips @MeatCubesNFT We are always working on more.
88,GM watching love is blind I realize one of you degens would never make it on there 10 days no trading or shit posting. You would go mad lol but I could imagine the questions... So what is your most rare trait lol
89,GM remember to spend time with your loved ones.
90,RT @digitaldamaged: This thing went viral and I can’t handle all the notifications of Twitter. It’s exhausting 🥵 https://t.co/swhM975jKB
91,@ABigThingBadly @LooksRareNFT @opensea It has a lot of room for growth but they are so active in imementing changes and really listen to the community.
