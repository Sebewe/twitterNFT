43,@JamieGNFT Move on bro. There is a chance this project can go forward and not wreck anyone atm.
44,@JamieGNFT It's peanuts to what I've got bro. No loss for me. I just plan on letting it ride out how it should before I call it a rug and not get influenced by yourself.
45,@JamieGNFT 🧂.  Your acting like a 🍌 atm.
46,@JamieGNFT @GrandpaApeBot If there is one thing I've learnt in this space it is not to jump to conclusions...
47,@JamieGNFT @GrandpaApeBot Either way you look very salty atm.
48,@JamieGNFT @GrandpaApeBot That's what your thinking atm. You could be right you could be wrong.
49,@JamieGNFT @GrandpaApeBot Looks like use got blocked because your were fudding the project. I'll wait and see what the outcome is.
50,@JamieGNFT @GrandpaApeBot Bro go fud something else. Until the dust settles and we get an explanation or the project fails that's all this is = FUD. I wouldn't be surprised if it's a rug but until then no one knows what his intentions are. I understand your salty but you need to move on
