0,#Nike is pulling it's products out of foot locker to focus on going direct to consumer. They will be the pioneers of metaverse sneakers and wearables. We should all be running to buy another @CLONEXCORP MNLTH. I'm fairly certain the journey will begin with these boxes...

26,@IHYPERGG83 @RTFKTstudios @oncyber_io We have confirmed that the space pod will be burned but we do not know exactly for what. My guess is each one is equivalent to one land plot. Others think it converts into a house as you suggest.

30,"@IHYPERGG83 @RTFKTstudios @oncyber_io My guess is the space pod is the ""land"" and the loot pod is one of the upgrades."

57,"@enneth_t So they will get full body, animation and customization very soon. Just like another project we're into....at the same exact time...."
58,@wiss_wisss @yobsyobsyobs @RTFKTstudios You'll be glad you did and there's a strong tie to clonex in the answer

61,Prepare for launch https://t.co/lWqIq8ViJZ
62,"@KashGetCarter @RTFKTstudios I guess it's how you view RTFKT. I wouldn't call it an add on. Both clonex and mnlth are part of a much greater ecosystem, along with pods, wearables and whatever else they imagine up."
63,@missmerghu @RTFKTstudios Yes. Great analogy. I had no idea that final fantasy would turn into an epic franchise when I played the original back on NES. But I knew I definitely wanted more of that aweso formula. The same is playing out here in the mv.
64,@missmerghu @RTFKTstudios Yes it's true. The hype is real someone once said. I'm glad we found something we can sustain enthusiasm about over the long run.
65,"@CryptoTron72 @RTFKTstudios Yea thats for sure. If you approach it like ""I'm going to make 200x over 12 months"" it sounds a lot better than trying to make a 2-3x in a week. Where do you think we will be in 12 months from now?"
66,@isaacsheppard53 @RTFKTstudios Yes the Air drops are a utility of Clonex. But the real utility is a fully functional mv ready avatar and an entire metaverse for them to play in. All coming in the next several weeks.
67,@scknows I Love Popcorn!
68,"#SpacePods by @RTFKTstudios and @oncyber_io are plots of land in the metaverse. Unlike plots in other mv, pods are 3D/ultra high res and have a community of hundreds of artists daily creating assets for them. My guess is they explode in price when the burn mechanism is explained."

71,@HODLCEO @x_wx_x @RTFKTstudios That's as good of a guess as any I have heard. I can't figure it out for the life of me. Feel bad for people who believe in these and get rugged.
72,@iamashchild @RTFKTstudios Familiar = safe. New = scary. I'd guess you are the kind of person who embraces change for the good it can bring to your life! Not everyone is that secure...
73,"@iamashchild @RTFKTstudios Ha! Great quote. It is very true. While there is room for everyone on the ship, some will never choose to board. I should be OK with that, but it's like, why?"
74,"@ZeroFeeYacht @RTFKTstudios @takashipom Yes, that's a good point. Art does not need a road map, as it is assuredly going to gain more appreciation over time. Diversification between mv utility and art sounds like a great balance. ☯️ I'm super excited for @fewocious fewo world too!"
75,"@x_wx_x @RTFKTstudios A wise person once told me ""don't try to get happier than happy."" We humans do have an impulse to fix what is not broken. Appreciation is the key. We are part of a community that's literally building the next internet. How can you beat that?"
76,"@Aye_0ne @RTFKTstudios @CLONEXCORP Thank you! Yes, WE will 💚"
77,"@ZeroFeeYacht @RTFKTstudios Yes, this is a bizarre phenomenon. Especially when there are new rugs launched every day. I like the proven track record of RTFKT delivering high quality NFT projects time after time. It makes us assured that each upcoming launch is likely to succeed as well."
