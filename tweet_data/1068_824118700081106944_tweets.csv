52,@NGMIrugged @bstsrvdbld @anna_paschenko I’m glad you understand and I respect this decision. Let’s all move forward with our own original new projects ❤️🙏🏽
53,Update: seems they changed their minds but for history’s sake here are some screen caps. https://t.co/oNXghBdktc
54,This space makes me exhausted as much as it makes me inspired
55,You see this @bstsrvdbld @anna_paschenko ? @wgminterfacesv2 thinks your project is public domain and that your project is “undoxxed” trying to claim your hard work and community
56,@WGMInterfacesV2 @blakemoser @WGMInterfaces “Walking away from a project” is not giving up copyright
57,@WGMInterfacesV2 @blakemoser @WGMInterfaces IMO you guys are not coming to this from the correct angle. Get permission before announcing this publicly when you aren’t even sure if you can do this or not.
58,"You guys literally can’t take @WGMInterfaces work &amp; community &amp; claim it as your own and release the project or a derivative of it if you don’t have permission, undoxxed or not. WTF https://t.co/woiwbRM2fa"
59,@WGMInterfacesV2 @blakemoser @WGMInterfaces The work was still posted by a creator undoxxed or not so you do not have permission to claim it is in the public domain.
60,"@joshqharris @liquiddensity Perhaps you think it is at fault, but I’m seeing this from the POV as a creator. I tried to share my POV on this situation as a creator in this space. if you yourself haven’t made art in this space in some scale - it’s going to be difficult for you to understand my view"
61,@WGMInterfacesV2 @blakemoser @WGMInterfaces I understand that but if you’re going be using their name and general likeness/piggyback in the community you literally need permission from the creators.
62,@joshqharris @liquiddensity Then you missed my point of the original tweet and you clearly seem to understand what my original tweet was about now if you agree about WL
63,@WGMInterfacesV2 @blakemoser @WGMInterfaces Be sure to get permissions on copyright because I am pretty sure their work is not CC0 and you may not have permission to make a derivative.
64,@blakemoser @WGMInterfaces @WGMInterfacesV2 Did you guys get copyright approval from the @WGMInterfaces team to release their work and make money off this?
65,@joshqharris @liquiddensity I said people weren’t owed anything because a bunch of people did say they were owed something
66,@joshqharris @liquiddensity You did though because you disagreed with my original tweet
67,@joshqharris @liquiddensity … despite whatever norms or methods become popular in the space.
68,"@joshqharris @liquiddensity 1. No one was being mean to people uspet about this. I simply stated facts. It is unreasonable to be uspet about not being able to buy a project.

2. Agree that there are grey areas; those will exist because web3 is decentralized &amp; every artist will go by their own method…"
69,"@joshqharris @liquiddensity As I said before. The WGMI team chose not to deliver NFTs. The art is still here regardless if there are NFTs or not. And getting on WL is not a contract that you are owed an NFT. That’s literally the end of the story. That goes for any project, mine or otherwise"
70,"@joshqharris @liquiddensity There is no ownership in a PFP project, why are you conflating WGMI to a company and their NFTs as shares for the community?"
71,@joshqharris @liquiddensity The art was released though. What you’re upset about is not being able to buy it.
72,@joshqharris … the fact that WL is NOT a promise or in any way a contract between a customer and an artist to buy said art. It may be conflated to a “promise” but it is NOT a contract.
73,"@joshqharris …or received money to do so. It’s not wrong to share work you are working on. It should be in the artists’ control to decide what they want to do with said art.

Yes it was NOT great to hand out WL on a project they decided to not deliver. However this does NOT change…"
74,"@joshqharris … DID rug pull because they DID promise and DID receive money from the community to deliver.

However - the core of the problem is the current NFT space’s desire to find the next BAYC/100x, pushing artists &amp; creatives to deliver when they haven’t even made promises…"
75,@joshqharris I do believe that it is possible they did NOT understand what they were getting into. I get that. They did the best they could to de escalate by dropping the project BEFORE mint. I DO applaud that. Because almost every other project that felt how they felt…
76,"@joshqharris This attitude is essentially the entire reason WGMI wanted to quit this space - the expectation from the community that they owe them the project at all, when their wish was just to create and share their work. Period"
77,"@joshqharris … in supporting the art or project, but your take on “web3 ownership” is not in uplifting or supportive of the makers of projects being free to make work how they want to, sold or not - this attitude pigeonholes creators into making work to benefit others and not themselves"
78,"@joshqharris Since when does a community own a project that isn’t placed on sale in any way shape or form? They don’t. Support is important, and I understand people are upset and have invested TIME… 1/2"
79,@joshqharris A community can be built around art that isn’t bought or sold. The art still exists. I think you’re entirely confusing art as a financial investment for the community and to art people simply come together to celebrate.
80,"@joshqharris The problem with what you’re saying is that they didn’t “sell” anything to you. So they owe you nothing, hence why WL is not an IOU ticket. You refuted your own argument."
81,@Loopifyyy ❤️
82,"@amritpaldesign So many reasons why I haven’t done one yet, and this is part of it."
83,*reserves your spot in line.
84,"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but getting on WL is NOT an IOU ticket to buying an NFT. It just reserves your queue in line."
85,"@nft_nolan @WGMInterfaces If people actually spent that much time and money on a WL spot, they totally forgot that getting a spot on WL IS NOT EQUIVALENT to an IOU ticket to purchasing the NFT. It just saves a spot for you that’s it."
86,@MarkTheHabibi I believe the key to projects succeeding long term is pushing your brand beyond the NFT space and into other products. People really have the blinders on with what NFTs can provide on their own without expanding beyond this space. It’s hindering. a closed ecosystem.
87,@MarkTheHabibi @Topaz_Crypt Agree.
88,@paperbuddha LUV YOUUUUUUU
89,@Miouneee @sknuevefc @WGMInterfaces I was on WL and I’m not mad.
90,@Miouneee @sknuevefc @WGMInterfaces You do too. Move on bro.
91,@liquiddensity They have literally made it because they are incorruptible by greed and money and truly believe in art.
92,@Miouneee @sknuevefc @WGMInterfaces Then buy another project. Deal with it. Real people make these projects. The WGMI team aren’t making ANY money off their own project either. Everyone needs money.
93,"@Miouneee @sknuevefc @WGMInterfaces Dude, you ARE the literal reason why they are quitting. All you care about is making money off of a bunch of artists."
94,"@sknuevefc @WGMInterfaces There should be zero people upset that this drop is not happening. That’s the entire point of their decision to stop, the pressure to deliver at all."
95,@sknuevefc @WGMInterfaces The sentiment is positive and I am not commenting on that. I am pointing out the group of people who are not happy about this.
96,"@ChaseBurnett @WGMInterfaces It’s literally so selfish and the entire reason artists get burnt out, hate working on projects, and desire to quit. For true artists like these folks it’s almost never about money. It’s about freedom of expression and enjoyment of creating."
97,@WGMInterfaces If you have this attitude you are literally part of the reason why they are deciding to discontinue the project.
98,@WGMInterfaces The amount of people who are feeling “rugged” they can’t buy this project is obscene. Enjoy art for as it is. It is here viewable FOR FREE. Since when does a piece of art need to be bought/sold to be appreciated. FFS.
99,Anyone complaining about @WGMInterfaces not delivering has forgotten that art can be enjoyed FOR FREE and not everything needs to be bought/sold/speculated like a stock. Just enjoy it. They built something special regardless if you could throw your ETH at it. https://t.co/0SAEMKXaNx
