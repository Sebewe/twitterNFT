49,@databased69 @HDaxos @ZssBecker Luckily our floor is almost back up to what it was before the tweet. I think he did us a favour tbh.
50,"@databased69 @HDaxos @ZssBecker I get where you’re coming from but with the way becker keeps rubbing in how everyone that’s not in it is missing out, this is also inevitable. 

He creates demand for “knowing what’s being said in there”, where there’s demand someone will always supply in this world."
51,"@databased69 @HDaxos @ZssBecker The only reason that happened is because of Becker. We all like Mole King, he’s putting in effort to summarise all important things everyday for us. He did it for free for months every single day. He’s not scamming whatsoever."

58,"@HDaxos @ZssBecker It’s a fraction of the profit I made from the months he was sharing the information everyday for free. 

You can hate all you want, he was not pumping bags and really putting in effort for free. It’s literally just post likes “citizens talking about..” “citizens looking at..”"
59,@HDaxos @ZssBecker Becker just gave us exposure to 700k people.
60,"@HDaxos @ZssBecker I got a ton of them and this makes me even more bullish, nothing illegal and Mole is infiltrating more alpha discords."
61,@HDaxos @ZssBecker There is absolutely no IP of Beckers used in the discord.
62,@ZssBecker You’re literally always throwing into your 700k followers faces that they’re not in it and then you’re surprised that people look for other ways to learn what is said?
63,"@ZssBecker Love you Becker but what is illegal about sharing what is is talked about in a discord from a free mint as you always say? 

He’s literally only saying what citizens talk about, not even any neo Tokyo official announcements. 

Not even screenshots."

66,@JPEGDaoMan @jpeg_liquidity I think worst case they would hire someone to do it with the money from royalties and the money from mint. Even with a couple mill that’s a good business decision. Rugging it would be like throwing a way a succesful business for no reason.
67,"@JPEGDaoMan @jpeg_liquidity Also the royalties will basicly allow them to get a big income if they keep doing what they’re doing, probably better than a lot of high paying jobs"
68,"@JPEGDaoMan @jpeg_liquidity I’m convinced it’s legit, it was free for months with constant updates. There’s no discord mods except for the team account and still it’s managed very well. 

I don’t think someone would put in that type of effort if they don’t like what they’re doing."
69,"@JPEGDaoMan @jpeg_liquidity For sure, especially with the team sifting through all those chats and summarising the most important alpha

Even if you had access to all those discords yourself, it would take a lot of time to do that everyday and not miss something"
70,"Sometimes you just gotta take the L and cut your losses

say you're down 50% on something that you deep down know is never going back to ATH

It’s the next best thing to being in NT discord
