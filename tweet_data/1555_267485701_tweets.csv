5,"Btw - the reason email is superior IMO is that it's a lot harder to lose track of things. Between all the other 97 messaging platforms, it's really hard to stay on top of things if you talk to a lot of people. My SLA is usually either 12 seconds, or 2 years. https://t.co/ypSsP5Y2Sz"
6,I wish people would stop trying to get rid of email and instead focus on making it better.
7,"When attempting a new, hard thing, remind yourself that it’s not always going to be this hard. The first few days of a new diet or exercise routine, or first few months of raising a fund can be excruciating. It gets easier. Don’t quit before the ball starts rolling down hill."

22,There's a ton of exciting updates to gameplay coming too. Check out the full details here! https://t.co/f9JOTlWADd
23,"Season 0: More updates will be made to the game based upon feedback. Depending on how Alpha goes, the game may transition SLP earning from Battles v2 into Origin during this season,  and Battles v2 will be shut down."
24,Alpha: the game will be available to everyone globally via Mavis Hub and Android APK.  Player feedback will be super important to help refine the game before the official release. There will be no token rewards disbursed during this phase.
25,Origin has been built from the ground up to be more approachable for a mainstream audience. Every new player will be given 3 Axies to ease onboarding. Let's dig into the timeline! 👇
26,"Big news from @AxieInfinity today! Origin (new game!) is going to be released at the end of Q1. It's going to have brand new interfaces, game mechanics, art, special effects, storylines, and an expansive onboarding experience. https://t.co/NIWcGl7tgu"

In the metaverse, the coolest “places” will win out just like in the physical world."

39,"Nomic is still looking to hit a total of $30 million in funding, which will help it build out a 30-person team and achieve its goals. 

We hope other organizations will join us in support!"
40,I should note that @a16z doesn’t expect a direct return from this funding. We’re donating because a stronger Ethereum ecosystem will have huge benefits for the advancement of web3 as a whole.
41,Gotta give kudos to Nomic cofounders and Argentinian crypto OGs @zfran and @alcuadrado for making the lives of Ethereum devs so much easier. 👏
42,"Nomic’s bigger vision spans 4 strategic pillars.
1. Solidity (Slang, new dev compiler)
2. EVM tooling (Rethnet, a building block to create debugging tools)
3. Local dev environment (Hardhat, dev env that’s integrated end-to-end)
4. Ethereum connector library (a revamped web3.js)"
43,"@HardhatHQ has already proven to be an invaluable tooling suite for Ethereum devs to deploy, compile, test and debug smart contracts and dApps.

That’s some serious growth! 🚀 https://t.co/OAgjcDXRlS"
44,"Formerly Nomic Labs, the new Foundation will enable their team to pursue even more ambitious projects and to focus on long-term, sustainable infrastructure development for Ethereum.
