2,DeFi Summer Ethereum OGs: @EvmosOrg rektdrop?
3,"There has never been a FaaS as successful as @_veDAO_ 

They've cornered an ecosystem and narrative.

Next up, we find out how relatively high the yields are for WEVE-USDC tomorrow

Then? veWEve... lock for boosted fees, bribes, and voting. Might fk around and write a proposal."
4,@AvgJoesCrypto https://t.co/Cf5qJ4QWhu
5,@MandaTiho @_veDAO_ Yeah agree good call
6,"So we trading the state of the union tonight?

Biden talks inflation, implores fed to walk down rate hikes, JPow dovish tomorrow, local bottom is in"
7,@dai_ubu Same. Can't complain about accumulating $FXS and $LUNA every two weeks tho.
8,"Everyone in the Solidly ve(3,3) game is so fundamental.

My magic lines say wait for volume and we see $0.21.

We all know what happens tomorrow for $WEVE-USDC on @SolidexFantom.

9,@dcfgod You minted the rainbow? Score 🌈
10,"I’ve seen so many good projects that undervalued or under resourced marketing and it does a disservice to the product. 

Empowering community, collaborating with users and product teams, and prioritizing engagement are ways to win in a hyper competitive crypto space. https://t.co/SQMT9xvDAg"

12,@gabagooldoteth Have you heard of an IPO? 😆
13,"@Cryptopleb4 @_veDAO_ You front ran me?! Give a berry a heads up next time 😆 

Weve seemed to find the same projects and Chad founders. 

Weve yet to make it, soon (tm)"
14,@____allo____ @Cryptopleb4 @JPEGd_69 @dropsnft Oh that’s great! As a no punker I am salty
15,"Solidly smooth brain move of the day:

Rotated all of my SEX/SOLID yield and excess FTM from IL into $WEVE. 

I am not nearly as clever and deep into the metagame and solidly wars as the @_veDAO_ chads. 

Oh captain my captain."
16,@Cryptopleb4 @JPEGd_69 @dropsnft Well said. Can’t believe they raise $88m with no product. Someone’s getting rekt
17,"Good work. Lots of underlying assumptions here but solid analogue to pump $SEX. 

@kamikaz_ETH would say it’s 10X higher market cap 😏 https://t.co/qFZGpUMGpu"
18,@BillyBobBaghold Really no team tbhaf
19,"@JohnTodaro1 I don’t think it’s this simple. Sellers exhausted, short squeeze, fastest growing asset class in the history of the world, censorship resistant, unstoppable…

Also you can have risk on and off within crypto"

21,@Page_Farms @Curvance @kinetic_money Following this one too.
22,"I could also buy ETH, stake it on @LidoFinance, bridge to Terra @anchor_protocol and mint UST. That locks up $ETH though. Decisions, decisions."
23,"Really need @Curvance to launch!

What are other ways to leverage stablecoins to get a loan that pays itself back?

I'm open to any and all chains/protocols/crazy ideas"
24,"Stablecoin gurus I need some advice. Want to structure a good self-repaying loan but @AlchemixFi is only paying 3.8% on DAI and LTV is 50% max.

@MIM_Spell CVX3pool looks pretty solid at 92% LTV, but yield is in the shitter."
25,@VentureCoinist We needed this. And those donations to the Ukraine are all more valuable now

29,"@Mepslol You’re mid curving this one I think. I am an ethereum believer first, but ignoring terra is short sighted. Lots of builders and new applications for luna. Are you singularly focused on anchor and ust?"
30,@ape_rture Are the patient apes back to allocating/bidding long yet?
31,"@WillbBTC You’re describing every fair launch defi project ever. Parabolic launch, precipitous drop to bottom, if successful we see steady recovery and growth.

I don’t mind buying airdrop dumpoors. Have @EvmosOrg described to claim process yet? ERC20 or native claim?"
32,"Been discussing direction @_veDAO_ could go in @EthropyFinance with the lads. Seeing it in action already. 

Great minds think alike for 1, 2…wen 3 @nickbtts @gabagooldoteth?

I’ll keep brainstorming with @wagmiAlexander and @AvgJoesCrypto https://t.co/IfnGRuslqt https://t.co/CJpQmcJ1uz"
33,@kamikaz_ETH @theclash0x Imagine not defi’ing tho…
34,@theclash0x @kamikaz_ETH Wagmi and ofc there’s room
35,"@kamikaz_ETH Agreed, and also a lack of awareness for non-web3 front end engineers. It’s kind of funny that web3 web dev has taken a step back due to MetaMask and hardware wallets. Everyone who’s doing cool shit is developing for mobile now and that doesn’t fly in web3"
36,@theclash0x @kamikaz_ETH Heh you must be new here
37,"@kamikaz_ETH This is true. If they can slap a good front end on it, show some metrics comparing capital efficiency/swap fees to competitors, get integrations w dex aggs…

I think it’s fine to fragment liquidity across diff dexs because it leads to innovation (either tech or token)"
38,"@0xkinnif Nearolidly

44,@kingblockchain @_veDAO_ It’s called derisking ser 🤣
45,"Can’t believe it’s been more than a month since the @_veDAO_ fair launch and it is just getting started. 

Retweeted myself like an asshole for clout"
46,RT @Ace_da_Book: Bullish @_veDAO_ because I invest in people and @gabagooldoteth knows the DeFi game as well as anyone. Bottom ticked $WEVE…
47,"RT @Ace_da_Book: Absolutely the most fun ecosystem, the best communities, the most based devs…Fantom. 

@gabagooldoteth arrived fashionably…"

50,@wagmiAlexander Wake me up at 5000
51,@kamikaz_ETH Andre?
52,@AvgJoesCrypto Let's brainstorm with @JasonHitchcock
53,"@JackNiewold Only comment is @_veDAO_ has massively different roots than @redactedcartel because it was a fair launch and there was no bonding requirement to earn $BTRFLY.

Treasury is outpacing $WeVE market cap too, quite unique for a DAO."
54,@flash36AD It’s evolved to a benchmark for me. It’s not practical to denominate in eth any more
55,Stablecoins and multichain ecosystems kinda messed up the whole “denominate in btc or eth” thing innit
56,@Fiskantes Exactly
57,@wagmiAlexander I work for SEX
58,@crafteconomy_ Where will liquidity be across the cosmos ecosystem considering the many dex options on Juno and Evmos (obviously @osmosiszone). Any plans for incentivized liquidity?
59,@theclash0x @wagmiAlexander @SolidexFantom @_veDAO_ 👀👀👀

63,@gabagooldoteth @_veDAO_ https://t.co/uVFlnRBYTA
64,@wagmiAlexander And just wait for the bribes to start rolling in once @SolidexFantom gets @_veDAO_ nft up and running. $WEVE is gonna hold its value very well
65,"Again, SEX is good. Technically it’s the best. 

Another banger thread from the Solidly Jedi. https://t.co/l3Ge33v2fn"
66,"Been long LUNA so no action but even the mechanism disbelievers see the investment potential. 

Outside the UST mint/LUNA burn dynamic, there is a flourishing TeFi ecosystem locking up LUNA supply as well.

72,"I prefer product before token, and this is an opportunity to experiment with Arbitrum before potentially getting paid with an airdrop.

Kudos to @AvgJoesCrypto for the piece"
73,"Will it be better to wait for a token until fees are much higher?

Sequencers are fighting scraps right now and it is more profitable to participate in alternative L1s like Fantom. The growth now appears to be steady since the launch hype. https://t.co/0w6E4fOopp"
74,"Open questions to discuss:
- Why do developers pick Arbitrum over Metis or Boba, which have tokens/incentive programs?
- Is @arbitrum success due to @optimismPBC delays?
- How much attention with @EvmosOrg take away from L2s?"
75,"The potential valuation is fascinating, and I agree TVL may be the best analogue we have, but it's definitely not the best way to value a chain. 

Important considerations (why @solana deserves high valuation IMO) are future growth, tech, and narrative. https://t.co/KGAdcFKE1Z"
76,"Awesome primer on @arbitrum if you haven't dipped your toes in yet.

I have enjoyed everything from @arbinyan to @GBlueberryClub and have become a bigtime @GBlueberryClub @vestafinance @fraxfinance @SynapseProtocol bull in the last several months thanks to Arbitrum. https://t.co/lxJj6R6hzK"
77,@WillbBTC 3 years. Dude you know where the bodies are buried.
78,@econoar Best counter signals
79,Now it's all over the place e.g. you combined major category tags with other things. Sharing feedback because this has made it much more difficult to stay up to date and organized.
80,"@Delphi_Digital Why did you make so many changes over the last week? I no longer receive emails when new pieces are published, and the content is extremely disorganized now. I preferred individual pieces with a single topic as this helped me categorize the research."
81,"Will be going to @CoinDesk Consensus 2022 with @fourmoonsllc 

Would be epic to have a IRL meet up with you all, the @EthropyFinance and @fourmoonsllc crews. 

Putting this out in the metaverse. Make it happen."
82,RT @deusexdao: The @deusexdao very own @sovereignsignal published a thoughtful piece on the relationship between philanthropy and developme…
83,"SEX is great, but have you ever tried...

No, that's the tweet."
84,@pandamoneybags @MetisDAO @bobanetwork @arbitrum What about ETH withdrawals?
85,"A token with a market cap of $24m just earned $725,000 from day 1 of @solidlyexchange wars.

That's a 0.09 P/E. Honestly, gud project.

Starting Wednesday, assuming @SolidexFantom fixes the voting bug, you can earn a lot of $SOLID and $SEX in the $WEVE-USDC pool, too. https://t.co/An5ihAxENC"
86,"This is certainly a problem for @MetisDAO to figure out. Only fast bridge is for the native asset, withdrawals require a 2.1 METIS balance to stay behind, and there's no way to get ETH out quickly.

I love the L2 experience, but @bobanetwork  and @arbitrum are more flexible https://t.co/kdfz6OQa7X"

91,"@cryptobrucey @GrumpySmurf That isn’t how Luna and ust will win. Do “@stablekwon” is Crypto Bezos. He is the consummate deal maker. Betting against him is like fading CZ. Like it or not, there’s gonna be a big opportunity for UST - next up is the @Nationals - a pro baseball team. That’s just the first"

93,@TaikiMaeda2 Soon… 🌗
94,@TeiHota @_veDAO_ Good point about the flexibility
95,"Gonna disagree with the guru on this. It’s an opportunity cost. It worked our great for early veCRV lockers but a sample size of 1 is not robust. 

I would advise taking some profits too and locking a bit. Or have @_veDAO_ do it for you https://t.co/MM9aZBHa1s"

98,@ape_rture Yeah that’s what I’m thinking. Holding off on dry powder rn
99,@cryptobrucey @GrumpySmurf I’ve seen some anti-UST takes from a lot of smart people but rely on data rather than theory. It’s survived many leverage unwinds and I don’t see that changing.
