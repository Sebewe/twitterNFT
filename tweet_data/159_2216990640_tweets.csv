1,@Josh76715709 @elliotrades The war doesn't have to be over for sentiment to improve. This is a smart business decision. This really isn't a big deal..why do you care so much? Does this impact you negatively in some way?
2,"@Josh76715709 @elliotrades I don't think he would be chastised for not delaying, but its probably better for everyone involved to not launch during times of rock bottom sentiment. It just so happens that the negative sentiment is caused by a war so it makes the delay even more appropriate."
3,@TraderNiro @elliotrades You might want to do just a LITTLE research on the project and founder before you assume things. I'll help you out a little. It's a AAA game and it's ready to be played. Good luck finding another.
4,"@SpeculatorArt Are there quality games being produced right now on Ava? If so, which ones?"
5,"@mbisonco @huxleysaga I don't get why they did that. Sure, a number of people in the community were rewarded because they were paying attention, but they also punished a lot of people who have supported them and now need to pay 2-3x for 1 comic.... ugh"
6,"Damn.. @huxleysaga stealth drops issue 3 while I'm on a work call. I def wouldn't be bitching if I was monitoring, so I wont be too negative but they should have rewarded early supporters given the struggle they had selling out 1 and 2. 😢"

9,"@LORDSAMURAI5 @joshnomics You're right. You would want to have food, water, bullets etc. and a network of people who know how to survive. So if that fits into your likely outcomes from an investment perspective, by all means go  invest in those instead of any other asset class."
10,"@Abraham_L_L Are you referring to “real” games (ie Bigtime, impostors etc) or are you talking about the dumb passive defi stuff passed off as gaming/p2e? There’s an argument for shorting all of it but there’s a big difference between the two."
11,@pixiekate13 @InvsbleFriends lol.
12,@FedorovMykhailo I sympathize but this is a misstep. This is basically the antithesis of crypto.
13,"@ClintEhrlich Do people actually think Ukrain has the upper hand like you are implying? Where are you getting that info?

17,Pretty interesting since there are so many pfp projects turning into P&amp;E and are valued exponentially higher than projects built to be P&amp;E. My bets are placed accordingly. https://t.co/ZYUj9ZT4dK
18,"@HildeHildsen @ncweaver @ahcastor @smdiehl @dgolumbia He wouldn't want that or he would not put his bias throughout his lecture (see his notes). Unfortunately, professors aren't taught how to teach so you get a mixed bag regardless of how intelligent/knowledgable  they might be."
19,@Kakuberry Don't let one person or a minority group of trash people create your reality. Sorry that happened to you
20,@ThetaTendies The Ukrainians are badass but you’re an insane person if you think that the US wouldn’t do the same.
21,@thefullcoin @huxleysaga @BenMauroArt I think the real aspect to celebrate is that they actually have the product (or at least some/a lot of it) produced already. Other projects shouldn’t be raising anywhere close to a project like Huxley when they have NOTHING built. This is why they “deserve” a higher floor.

24,"Note to new project founders. If you’re actually serious about ur project, consult people before you try to DIY everything. There are plenty of people that will give you advice for free or a mint. This can help you avoid basic/common pitfalls of launching a project. https://t.co/shrmXZkVuO"
25,"@readyplayerh I’ve been talking about this for a while now and thought I was just wrong and the market would stay dumb lol. I think (hope) we see the tides turning where projects will be valued based on not only proof of quality, but according to the stage of development they are in."
26,"@aanggggggggggg I believe this can be attributed to the trolley dilemma.

27,@Banks @elliotrades Lol visionary
28,"Huge congrats to the @huxleysaga team. I'm a dumbass for selling a bunch of comics/genesis token because I was scared the rollout was too complex for smooth brains. Welp, that clearly didn't matter. If you deliver a quality product, people will notice. https://t.co/6YluHwz3IA"
29,@itsdanataylor I’m pretty sure no one will notice you 🤷🏼‍♂️
30,@sven_nft @piovincenzo_ I haven’t used zen but have used others and 100% agree with this. Heard the same sentiment about zenledger elsewhere. I was using token tax and wanted to just start from scratch manually because there was no way the numbers made sense (said I made much more than I did).
31,"@readyplayerh I’m confident something good will come out of NT, but BYTES was poorly thought out from a timing perspective. Also, kind of silly to expect non citizen to hold anything when they receive no info about what’s being developed."
32,@elliotrades Special place in hell for these people.
33,@thefullcoin @huxleysaga @BenMauroArt I was just about to post something similar. I'm blown away with how much further along they are than just about EVERYONE in the entire space and people rather have a 10E PFF with a pixel game + token that will probably go to zero.
34,@beaniemaxi It’s lame someone reported this but maybe just move on? Getting a little ex bf/gf vibes.
35,I think this genesis of this thread was misguided (ie comparing IF to meka and hape doesn’t make sense) but there are a lot of good nuggets in here I agree with. https://t.co/I4wh0QCnwD
36,Update: I closed those longs at B/E and won't be doing that again for a while. Had no confidence in that trade or the market right now.
37,"@johnpetersMD @beaniemaxi I agree with that.

FWIW I dont think Beanie said anything controversial -- the R:R is off and would be for any project that goes 40-50x at launch. However, I think IF price has had more negative sentiment than even something like BAPE. Kind of interesting."
38,"@beaniemaxi Why didn’t anyone say this about azuki? Nothing against that project, but it was the most recent with a similar trajectory"
39,"@KeyboardMonkey3 @pwnlord69 I understand that but t he joke doesn’t really make a lot of sense. I must be bored, don’t mind me."
40,"@pwnlord69 @KeyboardMonkey3 I bet most people don’t even understand this tweet because it really doesn’t make sense in context. A 10E floor on the first day.. what a failure! 

There will always be top buyers. It’s like science or something."
41,@beaniemaxi Not really collectibles but @SuperFarmDAO tried doing this for @PlayImpostors and some people complained because they “wanted to keep their super”. SF was going to lock up all the funds raised too. 🤦🏼‍♂️

48,"@MJH_Haywire @beaniemaxi Just to name a few. 

That’s my point though. My opinion is that these “defi” pixel/passive games are going to be rendered obsolete when the attention shifts."

61,@CheerUpHumanity @_Smyly @itsdanataylor @opensea Thanks for clearing up my fat finger. *If
62,@Jerri_ZA @0xSMM @Gfunkera86 @pixelvault_ Perhaps projects should consider converting at least some of the ETH to the native token and then recycling it in an appropriate way. Tbh I'm not super confident in my take as I think a deeper understanding of economics is needed. I just know utility tokens need utility lol.
63,"@Jerri_ZA @0xSMM @Gfunkera86 @pixelvault_ I do see your point, but is exchanging ETH for POW an actual barrier to entry? 

Obviously I agree with your Ronin/Gala use case. 

Ive previously mentioned that I believe all these projects launching utility tokens w/ little utility or imminent utility is a mistake."
64,"@_Smyly @itsdanataylor @opensea Many of the people exploited don't recall clicking any links. At least of number of them are very tech savvy. Many people sign transactions on autopilot if they believe they are at the intended ""gateway"". Ff we're being honest, no one knows what the signature screen says anyway."
65,"@NFTethics I'm not a big fan of the guy, but you make no sense here. You're either a bad writer, which I don't believe, or you purposely wrote that post on OhShinny to make it sound like he was involved in something that he wasn't. Take a break or something."
66,"@Jerri_ZA @0xSMM @Gfunkera86 @pixelvault_ I'm no economist, but if we think of a project's ecosystem like any other economy, wouldn't you want to incentivize using your ""native"" currency for the purchase of ""goods"" in your economy/country/whatever? Price go up isn't a good reason, but if that is the result, so be it."
67,@EasyEatsBodega Shouldn't they be buying my Loft? Disappointed I haven't made 5x yet

74,@ohhshiny @payraw @NFTCryptoChicks I obviously don’t really know what happened but it does seem like @NFTethics muddled up that write-up purposely to possibly confuse the reader. I had to read it multiple times. Kinda dirty.
75,@payraw @NFTCryptoChicks @ohhshiny Would need to know more details still but given the context of the fine/jail for employee it’s not a good look. Still not crushing him as this info doesn’t prove he did anything illegal/unethical (even if it implies it or is likely). Still could have read it wrong.
76,"@payraw @NFTCryptoChicks @ohhshiny Maybe I read it wrong, but I don’t think ohshinny was the one fined."
77,@TheAshCarmen I fucked up by selling my first genesis token but luckily I still have a bag of comics. Welcome!
78,"@payraw @NFTCryptoChicks @ohhshiny I guess I just see a lot of grey areas with ""insider trading"" accusations and therefore can't really pass judgement without knowing every detail. I haven't heard of him doing anything malicious in the crypto/nft space so I'll just remain being annoyed instead of canceling. lol"
79,"Is there a point to this or is this just another ""influencer"" doing something shady? https://t.co/2MM5oP3h2y"

85,@MattSteffanina @elliotrades He explained his position well. I was disappointed at the people asking questions. He was trying to get feedback on the chief complaints about pricing and barely anyone said shit about it lol
86,@BlockNoChain im just deleting these comments given there is lack of understanding which was exasperated by the fact that I didnt realize what the price of WL was.
87,@SpeculatorArt If you don’t use this type of model or have a short term use case for the token (a REAL use) than there’s a high chance your token just continues to dump and if bad enough can put the entire project at risk.
88,"Gave up my request to speak &amp; since barely anyone has talked about the chief complaint Im going to throw this out into the ether. 

*The WL price is too high. Math on genesisNFT+mint price is basically DA price. Keep mint in Super - ppl are just ignorant on why this makes sense. https://t.co/NcRQSQa7oN"
89,@EasyEatsBodega how does that even make sense? They're allowed on SOL too and if they thought it was that great they'd be trading over there too lol
90,@EasyEatsBodega Why didn't they just let you trade on SOL too with the 1E equivalent?
91,@maxnaut This is such a good rule
92,@ledgerstatus Wen reimbursement plan?
93,"The only caveat to this is if the project and perhaps the token are designed to have a limited shelf life. This isn't typically the advertised case, so its a very low % of projects with this model."
94,"Public notice. STOP launching tokens for your NFT project that rewards NFT holders without a sustainable ecosystem for said token. Sure, NFT holders dump and get a nice payday, but longer term it can literally kill the ecosystem if the token drops 90%+. But what do I know."
