at a personal development level and mindset I’m not there 

it’s a work in progress"

51,"@Abraham_L_L yeah teacher did that on purpose to be dramatic since it’s an argumentative essay

52,@DanVerno ik right gm 👑
53,"@VGFreakXBL as this is more prevalent for the upbringing of the current generation on deck and the one following that 

more so then the past generations 

yes Ik everyone can go to college (want to be more technical and run stats) but you get where I’m going with this mb?"
54,"@VGFreakXBL this is what I was looking for 

I think the main arguing points for this essay foundation will be 

• barrier of entry 
• dependency on person / what they want to go into 
• cost of opportunity 

also going to loop into the assignment of looking through this lens as a gen z"
55,"@VGFreakXBL I actually would love to hear more of your perspective around this topic 

esp since you actually are “being” in this space 

this space imo amplified soft skills and skills in which you have to pickup / can work on 

whereas trade skills you can pickup at any moment or time"
56,"main point(s) to be made thus far: 

• barrier to entry (cost, debt etc) 
• cost of opportunity"
57,"@CircaDiem agree, although it doesn’t necessarily have to exist to go and learn to live on your own 

that part is and should be subjective as everyone learns this aspect differently"
58,"@HowTheProsDo cost of opportunity definitely the biggest argument point to be made for sure 

appreciate the insight"
59,"@HowTheProsDo Ig I’m looking at this through the lens of a gen z 

I’m consistently working and learning now, I’m able to make risky decisions now with little to no effect"
60,"@HowTheProsDo learning adult skills now + have already started / well on my way to developing my basis for thinking an acting 

does college amplify this for worse or better?"
61,"@HowTheProsDo but when you say work what do you mean? work as in before web 3 

or also web 3, willing to bet I could hit all these listed just solely working in the web 3 field"
62,"@HowTheProsDo why though? *and with this space in mind.* 

for context (here’s where I’m at and where many will find themselves especially when it comes to gen z) : 

• 16 in high school 
• on track to get my associates 
• decent amount / high opportunities outside of HS"
63,"have to write an argumentative essay for college composition 

the topic I chose was: Should everyone go to college?
