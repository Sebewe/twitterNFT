25,@Delta @Verizon Appreciate any help you can provide here @Delta. My frustration levels over the past few days are pretty high.
26,@Delta @Verizon @Delta your website was throwing errors yesterday when picking Choice Benefits. It was the last day to do before they expire. I wasn’t able to do it or get support from your agents. Today when I reached agents they said no exceptions and my Choice Benefits are lost.
27,@Delta @Verizon Absolutely @Delta - your representatives even after they are reached hours and hours later are telling me that my 2021 Choice Benefits are lost to me despite it being a website error yesterday and no way to reach anyone in time.
28,Today’s wait for assistance on @Delta Diamond line has now exceeded 3 hours. Literally circled #LakeTahoe in a car while on hold. @Verizon held strong almost the whole way but eventually #calldrop. Will never get these 3 useless hours back.
29,Hey @Delta - great job for not letting me pick my Diamond Choice benefits for 2021. Messaging and Diamond Line also not timely. Perhaps it’s time to switch to #UnitedAirlines
