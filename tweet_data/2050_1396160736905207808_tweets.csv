10,"@Jup1t3r13 @smokethatdank1 ah no, I'm not in the fast train. it's a slow one :) months slow"
11,@smokethatdank1 I was expecting a bounce because BTI and because news sell off like this never last. BUT... I still expect way ETH to go way lower. Just wait ;)
12,@Oxxyy13 @Degentraland https://t.co/j5zJD24hUg
13,@backseats_eth Bruh.  Same. I wish I could do 125x lever on this short.
14,@Degentraland I disagree. Doodles is not the kids friendly brand that most people paint it to be. That's like saying South Park is Family Friendly because you know...they are cartoon of little kids. While in some things we may agree. I disagree that Doodles will ever be seen as kids friendly.
15,@Degentraland @doodles Ehh nope. Smoking is a no no...you arw wrong here IMO.

62,@NFT_Shooter Local bottom yes.
63,@AbuSpinky @GiancarloChaux Ehh...I got into NFTs in 2021 yes. But ETH in 2014. I still agree with the take. Being up from 2016 means nothing. I hate this narrative for any market. So buckle up. More pain incoming :)
64,@PixlitEth @jascolors Maybe :P
65,@crypto_gatos @FuZzyy_14 @AzukiZen Exactly why I don't hold any. Not a Weeb and like other said. The floors are just meh. Some rare ones I do like. But agija not a weeb so I wouldn't be able to hold for too long.

80,@PixlitEth @coolcatsnft Well. 2 of them are locked in contracts that have no way to be taken out. 2 other cats have been flagged as hacked by OpenSea and are now stuck the liquidity pools. They are flaged so the liquidity pool contract won't let anyone take them out. 1 more of a person that lost his key

Just trying to help and sharing a way to recover access to your stuff(without having to fully rely on MM or TZ). This can be done with software wallets too but it's always better to use a hardware one unless you are willing to throw away that seed.
