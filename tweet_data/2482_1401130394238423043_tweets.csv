50,"A less conservative but still generous interpretation sets above previous FP sales back to FP. These were rares, I looked at them.

That puts the avearge at .646, at a community loss of 37.611 ETH in value.

That is US 103K in value stolen from the community by one man's vanity."
51,"I did the math.

During the period that @CryptoMories were delisted on OS and the announcement that a deal was made there were ~263 sales at an aggregate average of .688 ETH.

The prior floor was .789. Conservatively this is a 26 ETH loss at minimum to the community."

70,This direct lift was for the creation of a commercial product. These were made immediately after the widely viewed and awarded Steve Madden images. He sued them. https://t.co/Tzzfuf6xml
71,"Now there is nothing wrong with being referential. Ideas have to come from somewhere, but to DMCA someone because you think they stole from you, that's not where it is at. Not with art.
