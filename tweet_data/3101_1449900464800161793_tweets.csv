1,@ThePossessedNFT Y'all have been pumping some genuinely quality stuff.  Sometimes it is the little things. Can't wait for 50k+! When is our next sneak peak? 👀
2,@greg16676935420 No Cap’n Crunch? This list is a rug.
3,@ThePossessedNFT Y’all have been giving off such professional vibes and I absolutely love it. Such a breath of fresh air as they’re really few and far between these days it seems.
4,@Filip92851741 @ThePossessedNFT My guy. This isn’t discord. This is twitter.

36,@rob_otor @0xBender Better to be a ghost town pre-mint and try to grow a genuine community of people with the right mindset and that want to be there. Quality &gt; Quantity.
37,@t4t0_s4n @sporthtundar @MelonyWhiteArt I did. That statement is contradictory. If art is subjective how can NFTs not be art? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. There are a lot of pieces which are hand drawn and uploaded manually that people pour their passion into.
38,@sporthtundar @MelonyWhiteArt Art is subjective. And there is a rich pool of talented artists who are turning to NFTs because they are getting the recognition they deserve and also earning royalties on their work.
