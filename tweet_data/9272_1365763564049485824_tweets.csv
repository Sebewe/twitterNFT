11,"9) Oh and Debt to GDP at over 120?

It's only the single highest point in the history of the US.

Higher than any war period, depression, recession, etc. 230 years of data. We are at an all time high.

We can't afford the things we want. We, as a country, are over leveraged. https://t.co/YizxrAnuLK"
12,"8) Some context is needed. And a description key. 

M = Money Supply
V =  Velocity of Money
P = Price of Goods and Services
Q = Quantity of Good and Services 

MV is multiplying the two and together they equal PQ multiplied together. PQ combined is Nominal GDP."
13,"7) Inflation in and of itself is not bad. If GDP exceeds inflation then we can navigate in that scenario. Inflation does reduce our debt problem.

However, raising rates could suppress GDP, slow consumption, increase debt service.

You don't deviate a 40 year trend without pain."
14,"6) But increasing the money supply is unavoidable when we depend on debt as a country. Especially when it is outrunning our production via GDP.

We never reduced debt to GDP coming out of prior recession. It skyrocketed with Covid. 

&gt;120...... not healthy. https://t.co/HtFf1lYLjz"
15,"5) Meanwhile we do not all get richer just because more money enters the system. Purchasing power matters. Market share of purchasing power matters.

We are accentuating wealth inequality by not fixing the root cause.

The impact of temporary fixes is dilutive in nature. https://t.co/vrbUp7dSkS"
16,"4) Guess it's good that the money supply is on a two decade ramp. What could go wrong?

And with absolute abandonment since Covid. With maybe another $4 trillion this year to come.

Surely this won't contribute towards inflation?

#inflation #moneyprinter #longtermtrends https://t.co/zqb21WTQrM"
17,"3) Meanwhile, velocity of money has collapsed following Covid shutdowns. 

That makes sense.

But it hasn't come back at all. And it's in a decade long downtrend.

MV = PQ. PQ = Nominal GDP https://t.co/bQ83A7X3jh"
18,"We have some room prior to the yield curve inverting, but the decline is accelerating. We are about to accelerate short term rates and I do not think we see long term rates keep pace. 

Inversion could happen this year. Grey lines in the charts are recessions.
