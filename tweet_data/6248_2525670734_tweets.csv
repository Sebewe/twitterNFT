88,"@sutranation We are building a animated show, why would I want to FOMO in 2000 people that are not the right collectors and that are buying just to make money. We want people that are excited to see the journey and be a part of it. We sold over 2050 Moji's from our presale, only 23 are listed"
89,"@sutranation People end up loosing interest, and the reason is they mainly collected in hope to make money, the interest in the project itself it's rarely there."
90,@sutranation I'm 100% sure the FOMO narrative is what opened the doors for scammers to exist. To sell out a project in 2 hours you either need a really big personal investment upfront or a scammy marketing strategy to induce a fake sense of scarcity.
91,"@sutranation Right, and if you roadmap is really achievable, starting to build with funds coming from around 15/20% of the collection being sold, you can show future collectors what the project will really be about."
92,"@sutranation When we started our project telling everybody that the FOMO 1 hour sold out model was mainly a scam and everything was botted, few people listened.A legit project should take the time to build and find the right collectors,if selling out is the only goal how can it not be a scam?"
