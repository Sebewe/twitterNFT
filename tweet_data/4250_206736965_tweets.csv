97,"@chhopsky @brianjcho Thanks. I think what I’m trying to tease out, is what was obvious within the community (“of course we want to follow it like sports”) vs what somewhat who didn’t play games at all might’ve thought, particularly if “esports” wasn’t even established yet. Purely curiosity question😀"
98,"@chhopsky @brianjcho I wasn’t familiar with shoutcasting until I saw your reply, so I’m genuinely curious what the mainstream response was to it? I feel like most people would’ve been saying’ “These gamers want to listen to what? That’s silly and never going to be a big thing.”"
