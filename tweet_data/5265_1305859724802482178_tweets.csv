2,@Kwil_App Understood. Not that I’m aware of. I think the idea though is that eventually government and everyone will use blockchains so it will all become open and transparent in the future. That’s the goal at least!
3,@Kwil_App All Web3 projects (which are decentralized) are anti-corruption. That’s the point of smart contracts and this entire industry :)
4,"Crypto is finding so much ""product market fit"" on a global scale right now:

- A means to flee war &amp; bring your $$ with you
- A means to freely raise $$ to support bullied nations
- A means to flee devalued currencies

Pretty amazing to see cryptos life saving utility on display"
5,"If you're a creator, entrepreneur or marketing and want to learn how to incorporate Web3 into your business/community...

Check out our new Web3 report and join the Web3 Academy Discord Community!

The best place to learn, ask, share and network in Web3
https://t.co/Sz4RDvFgpn"
6,"Just like the internet has taken 40+ years to be what it is today...

Web3 will take time to develop and prove itself

That said, I'd rather be supporting this technology and trying to understand it than against it

Web3 is not IF, it is when

It is inevitable"
7,"Web3 is not yet in its full form.

It's not completely decentralized or censorship resistant, yet

It's not seamless and interoperable, yet

We don't know the best token structures, yet

There is a lot to fix, to learn and a lot of innovation still needed"
8,"The utility and opportunities that Web3 provide for every person on the planet are endless

IMO it will change the world just as much or more as the internet itself did

But of course, we are not there yet. 

It's a nascent technology ripe with scams, experiments and dog crap ;)"
9,"This means that a token can be a form of equity AND your access into a discord community OR a ticket to an IRL event

It means that tokens can be a form of governance (think voting) IN ADDITION TO an appreciating asset that ALSO shows you premium content on Netflix or a blog"
10,"You remember that these tokens are all programmable?

So not only do these tokens have all the 100x more efficient purposes mentioned above w/ regards to equity/funding/IP, etc.

They can have a 2nd purpose with utility... replacing most marketing ""tools"" businesses use"
11,"Think about the costs/time/sweat to start an LLC in the USA, open a bank, acquire funding globally (not even possible), file your patents/trademarks and hire a team globally

I can literally do ALL of this in &lt;10 mins with Web3 tools like NFTs and Tokens

But wait, it gets better"
12,"Web3 tools make all of this 100x better because they can be created permissionlessly with 0 intermediaries, in seconds, and be available on global liquid markets immediately!

Do you understand how massive this is for innovation and capital flow around the world?"
13,"These Web3 tools (tokens/NFTs) are a means for creators/communities/entrepreneurs to establish:

- funding
- capital distribution
- governance
- access
- IP
- structure
- incentives
- etc.

Yes, we can do all this in tradition world. 

So why is this better in Web3?"
14,"NFTs - A non-fungible token that can represent ownership of anything on or off the blockchain.

We understand Art, but think past this. What else is non-fungible in our world?

Certificates, event tickets, domains, awards, keys, real estate, prescriptions, identity, data. etc."
15,"Tokens (fungible &amp; non-fungible) act as tools in Web3 that serve many purposes for communities, devs, creators &amp; biz

Lets break them down first b4 discussing their purpose:

Tokens - fungible units of account that can be used as currency, equity, governance, reward systems, etc."
16,"Web3 is a technological improvement just as much as a monetary improvement.

It means global equality!

I believe this is the point that many people miss

Its why the web3 haters are missing the forest for the trees here

So why tokens? Aren't they all just scams?"
17,"Need banking services bc banks turned you down for living in a poor neighbourhood? 

#Web3 fixes this

Need funding for an idea across the world but cant bc the country you live in? 

#Web3 fixes this

Want to share ur beliefs on social media w/o being banned? 

#Web3 fixes this"
18,"One thing to note here b4 getting into tokens

This is all being built using decentralized &amp; censorship resistant platforms &amp; apps

Meaning, whatever is programmed into the app, happens

Doesn't matter your race, location, beliefs, values, etc.

The implications here are massive"
19,"Where Web3 takes even the real world experience to a new level is through programability

We can program anything based on the digital assets/activity from your wallet

Meaning, we can create specific digital experiences, provide access, etc. seamlessly based on the user wallet"
20,"Web3 interoperability creates an internet experience more like the real world 

ex. If we buy a shirt in a store we don’t have to leave it there when we exit (in web2 we do)

In web3 we can take it to the next location, just like in the physical world

But wait, it gets better..."
21,"Interoperability in Web3 means your crypto/web3 wallet becomes your 1 secure account/profile for the internet

It moves in/out of applications along w/ what’s in it

This means no more 100s of accounts and passwords &amp; no friction to move from one platform to another. https://t.co/HzbQPgpK9E"
22,"Digital Ownership in Web3 is the equivalent to holding cash, a bar of gold or your passport in a vault under your bed... but on your digital devices 

...A massive unlock thanks to blockchain &amp; smart contracts

2. Interoperability of you &amp; your digital goods across the internet"
23,"What is #Web3 and why does it matter? 🧵

Forget tokens, NFTs &amp; number go up for 1 sec

Lets get clear on 2 foundational changes to the internet that Web3 enables:

1. Digital Ownership: The ability to own something digital without the need for a custodian/trusted 3rd party"

In a bull market everyone is having fun and excited... but there are just so many stupid takes and noise

78,"Web3 enables you to build the community first, then work together to build the solution:

1. Build a community around a problem

2. Together, incentivized through a token, build a product/service that solves said problem

Web3 provides so much opportunity!"
79,"If you want to succeed in Web3, the strategy is simple:

1. Build a product/service that ACTUALLY solves a problem for people

2. Build a community around said problem

Wherever web3 leads us, this will position you 4 success

Alternatively, Web3 enables the opposite to work too"
