Most people I know work with 2 buckets, but breaking out the overhead from the neutral tasks feels like it a better way to budget effort. https://t.co/w9RuoqV6So"

2,"Watching a war play out in real-time isn't new, but the volume of 1st hand reports, expert opinions, and armchair analysis available on the internet is a uniquely 2020s phenomena enabled by social media.

4,"@NayutSitachitt @stratechery Can’t agree more on the investment - $1B is a drop in the bucket here.

Feel like the pitch to merchants though is ease of integration; as long as everything works seamlessly, it’s going to be the default solution for first-time merchants IMO (and defaults are very powerful)."
5,"@NayutSitachitt @stratechery Feel like you’re underestimating the the logistics flywheel that is available.

Yes, there’s no demand aggregation to drive performance, but centralizing logistics will still be a net value add for the average Shop merchant, esp in a world where 2 day shipping is table stakes."

7,"Brilliant thread on Web3 media and creator value capture.

Web3 allows producers of content to capture more value by eliminating intermediaries.

A musician with 1000 dedicated listeners probably can’t make a living on Spotify, but perhaps could in a Web3 environment. https://t.co/jaBLBJ8az6"

9,"One of the humbling things about working in the e-com space is the degree to which customers have come to expect 1-2 day delivery.

At least in the US, most of us live in a world where the number of goods available at a quality price and a 1-2 day delivery speed is astronomical."
10,"Remember the logic of the power law:
The rewards for success will be massively greater than the costs of honorable setbacks."
11,"Increasingly convinced that the likelihood of my normie friends using current-gen Web3 wallets is about the same as them discovering the benefits of an IRC server.

We have yet to see a Web3 wallet built for the masses."
12,"Continuously amazed by the fact that everyone’s a critic until they try something for themselves.

Turn your first reaction from “that’s dumb and will never work” to “I’d never considered that, I should learn more.”

This is the way."
13,@goldfishgirleth Happy birthday!
14,The absence of any forward-looking guidance from the Fed has resulted in a complete loss of control of the narrative. https://t.co/FqXE0OBzbS
15,"A year ago I thought DeFi was the most compelling use case of crypto.

I’ve since learned that most people are not as excited about removing intermediaries as I am, which makes a certain amount of sense.

I still think DeFi will be revolutionary, but not in the ways I’d expected."
16,@iamDCinvestor It’s not even immediately clear to me that crypto should be an inflation hedge (I know that will offend the hard money crowd).

Thanks so much for sharing."
21,"@lennysan @0xShah Thank you for this, so excited to dig in!"
22,"Digitally-native companies are already realizing that investing in their communities can solve all sorts of marketing challenges that upstarts face.

What's controversial about technology that puts community front and center?"
23,"I don't think it's overly controversial to suggest that the way people around the world engage with the web will be different in 20 years.

Furthermore, I don't think it's controversial to postulate that companies and brands that build WITH their customers will outperform."
24,"My Web3 investment thesis is pretty simple:

As people continue to increase the amount of time they spend living, working, and playing in digital spaces, new digitally-native structures will emerge to both reward and monetize."
25,"@rsg @benedictevans This seems spot on.

I don’t think it eliminates the need for a decentralized layer either: decentralization enables portability and composability.

I want to own my digital assets on a credibly neutral platform, not on Meta, Epic, or Google’s platform."
26,"@benedictevans I expect there will always be an avenue for self-custody, but it’s not something that’s likely to appeal to any significant portion of users.

I don’t think the inevitable presence of abstraction or centralized services will make digital assets any less interesting though."
27,"@wongisrite Supporting digital artists, gaining verifiable ownership of a digital asset, and being part of a community of holders is more than enough “utility” for art NFTs."
28,"In Web2, distribution is top-down: companies have to convince you to open up your wallet.

In Web3, distribution is bottoms-up: the community has to convince you to open up your wallet."
29,"Information asymmetry in the digital age is a choice.

31,@adamscochran Wonder how much of this can be attributed to the fact that we’re in a midterm election year.
32,"People are going to pitch this as a way to remove an attack vector (the front-end) on Web3.

The biggest unlock here though is that it enables Web3 devs to launch an MVP without a dedicated UI.

Somewhat like knocking credit cards because they require more steps to settle than using cash.

55,"A useful way to think about network effects is that for every incremental user joining a network, the decision to join for the next user becomes more heavily weighted in the “join” direction."
56,"@levie With every incremental user, the join/not-join decision for a later users becomes more heavily weighted towards joining.

As networks get larger, joining becomes more attractive than not joining."

While it’s true your Tinder date doesn’t have access to your personal data today, governments, banks, and tech companies certainly do.

83,"@cdixon Who is capturing the value of network effects is a really powerful way to think about Web3.

Would also add that arguments around decentralization falsely frame it as binary, when in fact it’s clearly a spectrum."
84,"@iamDCinvestor OP compares Web3 to a techno-utopia instead of the status quo.

I get the desire to live in a world where everything is bountiful and no one cares about ownership, but that’s not the world that Web3 is replacing."
85,"One question I’d have for anyone criticizing Web3 is whether they perceive it to be more or less centralized than Web2.

To me, it’s obvious that NFTs are more composable than a Facebook post, but I wonder if the thought leaders decrying Web3 think differently. https://t.co/6LdCIaoptK"

There’s no equivalent verification for non-NFT PFPs (should your LinkedIn profile be verified off of your drivers license?)

If someone cares enough to verify your ownership of an asset that’s easily doable using Etherscan"
91,"@danfinlay Yes, what a great take.

Do you really want Twitter, OpenSea, or anyone else providing social proof of authentic digital goods? 

I hold NFTs from his project (which ironically isn’t yet verified on OpenSea)."
92,"@nftking15 @HollanderAdam @BoredApeYC @coolcatsnft @doodles @worldofwomennft @supducks @lazylions Agree with this, strongly even. Relying on OpenSea to gatekeep what’s legitimate and what’s not is exactly what this space doesn’t need."
