37,"That moment when all you non hidden NFT's are sold and you no longer have a good pfp to use. :( #NFT 
Anyone got a good pfp collection?"
38,@talkingnft @gmcafeNFT Lets see if I can keep the lucky streak going.
39,@gmcafeNFT floor prices went too high. Even without me wanting to sell them and expecting them to increase more. I had to pull the trigger since this is some big cash for me.
40,"@alanthenftguy Would be cool for sure, keep up the good work!"
41,RT @alanthenftguy: Retweet for Chance to Win Ledger Nano X
42,Saw this collection on the homepage of OpenSea so I picked one up https://t.co/A8xgOv0OBu
43,"@talkingnft Saw the tweet and aped in, was just a bit too late to get one of the 0,1 eth ones"
44,@talkingnft It is behind a few minutes for me too. Hope it is fixed soon since it bothers me
45,"Guess people figured out really fast that the price was way too low (Floor up almost 3x in 4 days). Once the collection is fully minted this could blow up, if anyone would be willing to sell any of them atleast ;) @gmcafeNFT https://t.co/LNOVZgcHnR"
46,@talkingnft @gmcafeNFT The best gift for sure!
47,Interesting how only 25 of the 271 cows from @gmcafeNFT are listed (of which only 8 for less then 1 ETH) #NFT #NFTCommunity
48,@gmcafeNFT I took me some time too but I have removed the listing on all of mine! They won’t leave anymore.
49,"@BenColefax @gmcafeNFT Bought 2 from the original 10 and around 3 from the first 100 but right now I have only 2 left since I got some really good offers on the others. Will be buying anything around 0,35 from now on for sure since I want to improve my collection"
50,"Got a new friend @gmcafeNFT  https://t.co/w57fHCEj7J
People are selling too cheap right now.
Collection almost fully sold, things might get interesting"
51,Anyone know about a tool that can show me my OpenSea returns? No clue what my results are till now and I like to believe I am making a profit.
52,@talkingnft Found any promising collections today?
53,@HiLLCoRe2 @BenColefax @gmcafeNFT Seems like my friend got an new home. Take care of him!

61,Aped into @_InfinityDOT auto polkadot reward with an 3m marketcap. Can see this going atleast 10x from current price with some luck.
62,@Ezekielnfts @BoredApeYC Would be stupid not to try. To the Moon #bayc
63,Got some of the profit from santa coin and moved it into another meme coin @SymBULLCoin #SymBULL.
64,"OpenSea not working again, big suprise!"
65,"Happy to see that I was able to cash out at the top, don't see it going anywhere anymore. https://t.co/gcaI6nppae"
66,#SantaCoin took 10k profit out letting the rest run. https://t.co/I9ycVqgIVb
67,#santacoin blew up towards almost 60m marketcap. Still gaining loads of BUSD for holding. Holders increased even further towards almost 15000 (3 times what it was yesterday). https://t.co/3VPuaxcTr6
68,#SANTACOIN holders increased from 2400 to 5400 in the last 15 hours. This still could still have some legs.
69,"@ksicrypto @PolkaCity @Bitboy_Crypto Yeah that is bearish, f that guy"
70,"@Santa_Coins 
Santa coin starting to looking decent, already got 15 BUSD return from my investment of 500 USD yesterday. Marketcap currently  3.5M, this could go for an bit. Still risky play but one of the better meme coins around."
71,@Santa_Coins Is there an reason why you locked the wallet for such an small amount of time? One is only 12 hours left and the other is 8 days. Might aswell keep unlocked with such small timeframes
