64,"@jmaze_eth There are security concerns in web2. The argument being made that they feel unsafe is preposterous. You can just as easily look up any VP, director, c-suite employee of almost any company and quickly find their information. This isn’t a new concern. Founders should be doxed."

92,"Supporting these types of projects by even looking for a quick flip adds to the issue. The more people that mint these projects and pump the bags of lazy operators, the more people will reproduce it. For every new cash grab we’re going 1 step forward just to go 2 steps back."
