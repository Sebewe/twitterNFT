3,"I want to say my #Phunk is actually my favorite and most valued NFT to me for so many reasons. It also holds its value rather well considering its got no one trying to make it into more than an NFT PFP.
I love phunks and this community. Puts a smile on my face. :)

10,@HeroesEmpires I would like to work with your company as an advisor. I have a few ideas to help with the inflationary HE prices. I really want to help the game succeed for both players and the company making profit. It's the only NFT game I've enjoyed and I see that has potential

25,"@Mineian0x @CryptoBoj I don't think JF is forcing anything. They don't really have anything to prove. The art is good, the community is good, and the NFT makes statement imo. I would still own my rank 450 JF if it wasn't taken from a scammer :("
26,"@CryptoBoj Yeah, I'm saying forced utility, wolf game is almost strictly game/utility with smart contracts. Most PFP projects with the breeding, stake your NFT to earn a token, or NFT burning is literally just trying to force value by making it scarce or by making it a producing asset"
27,"I think in the end, great art or utility will weed out majority of PFP NFT's. I could be 100% wrong, but I just don't see how PFP with forced utility is going to survive."

35,"@filifanka @IThatirishguy @GodsUnchained Lol... I couldn't find it anywhere. I was under the assumption from their last video it would be fused from the stars we earn from ranked play. I'm just salty at all the other P2E games right now. Seems like everything right now is ""buy an NFT to play, then slightly earn"""
