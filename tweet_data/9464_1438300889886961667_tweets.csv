21,"@itskeylay @DuetLovable The honest truth is Tezos is the best for the art, and Solana is better for PFP collections. I’m not interested in pfps that don’t have big brand potential, and I love affordable art. 

So only ETH and XTZ for me."
22,"@itskeylay @DuetLovable Thank you! But, I’d say I have a long way to go. I’m very humbled at the opportunity to collect from great artists at what I would consider an extremely attractive price point. 

I think that Tezos has really marketability in art based NFTs, and we will see it blow up."
