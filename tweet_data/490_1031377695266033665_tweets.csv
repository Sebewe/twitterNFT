9,@GaryGeck Elon has a company called the boring company. He was ahead of the curve.
10,@GaryGeck @BoredApeYC Elon put out an NFT. It Failed. 4 Creative dudes at a bar make a token that allows you to initially draw dicks on a wall 1 pixel every 15 minutes and it's the quickest / highest appreciating asset of all time.
11,@GaryGeck Elon bought Bitcoin and Doge. At least our tokens have utility.

17,9. Fo Shillze Dizzle. See you in the Sandbox.
18,8. Did I mention these Avatars will have Play to Earn utilities?
19,7. You'll want to be at Snoops Sandbox parties.... after buying Death Row he said it would be the first NFT label. Sandbox is where he works out the kinks and the Doggies will be the ones rewarded.
20,6. Sandbox has been sweeping their own floor which is hella bullish....
21,5. Tons of Mid Range Sales.... I appreciate the rarity and diversity in these characters. A gold Snoop just sold for 69.420ETH
22,4. There are alot of new buyers in this collection so be careful because the price has been volatile. Though once paperhands are left under 1 ETH this project will be a moon shot.
23,"3. A lot of influencers, celebrities and brands will be in Sandbox. Leading with Snoop makes The Doggies OG. Sure everyone will have their PFP clone.... But if you want to be an OG in that world... Doggies will be your ticket if you are starting out green."
24,2. @TheSandboxGame is not messing around. With Alpha 2 set to release this week we are sure to see more people using the games and understanding what they are bringing to the table in terms of world building and utility.
25,1. @SnoopDogg  is the most influential artist in our NFT space. If you don't know who Snoop Dogg is you might as well be living under a rock. The press will continue to hit the wire for the next few months on this project and other celebrities will follow how Uncle Snoop moves.
26,@TheSnoopAvatars on @TheSandboxGame might be one of my favorite plays in the space rn. Here's Why 🧵

32,@GaryGeck @BoredApeYC OS migration played a huge part in it. But the numbers don't lie. If we get the richest man in the world to buy with only 500 listed we are going to see a supply shock unlike anything we have ever seen. Will be wild.
33,@TappySF Sandbox... Alpha 2 comes out March 3rd.
34,"Dear, @BoredApeYC continue to HODL. There is a Major Supply Shortage on Apes. I see a slingshot move to 200ETH in the next 30 days. Elon will get behind $APE and BAYC will have a Flag on the Moon in no time. Prepare for Lift Off.🚀🦧🌝🏴‍☠️💣⚓️ https://t.co/i3fbsFalIR"
