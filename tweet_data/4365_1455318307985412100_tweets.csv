8,@pa5301 @WGMInterfaces Definitely give them props and respect for the decision made. Authentic and transparent. They could have easily continued and sold out with a big bag full of eth but took the higher road.

51,@BAYC2745 This is so underrated for founders. Good stuff @BAYC2745
52,"@0xTgood @BAYC2745 @blader @psychedelic_nft That would be unlikely as it would give minters too big of an advantage. Also many have transferred to ledgers, which volt has highly encouraged."
53,@ceobillionaire @Montreal_AI PA brother!
54,@mad_eth @Coinaban @BAYC2745 @blader @psychedelic_nft Yea I have a feeling the method to obtaining c3 is going to be different. We’ll need to make a decision based off of what we have possibly.
55,"@lidynasty @BAYC2745 @blader @psychedelic_nft Honestly, I’m not sure expanding the full set will make it that much smaller because the people who got c2 and Papp are still holding"

90,@dtrain22k In the front end everything looked ok.
91,"@dtrain22k Not sure about that but the glitch happened because it was transferred out of the wallet without canceling. Later on, it somehow made its way back to the original wallet where it was listed (but not canceled) and the listing was live again on the back end."
92,@dtrain22k Yes you have to cancel for each time you’ve listed a new price.
