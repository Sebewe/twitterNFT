42,@0xinc Imagine if DMCAs just came flooding in for kevin LOL
43,@PaulHousberg Love the thread. Atm we’re definitely in a position where big/moderately-big collectors on ct can bring sales for 1/1 artists much more than any trad gallery can. This is just a fact. Adoption for NFTs just isnt there just yet for me to be convinced a commission % is worth it.
44,@bloomingvisions It better be a considerable ath or thats just not worth it for me imo
