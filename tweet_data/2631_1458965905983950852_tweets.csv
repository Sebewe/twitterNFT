12,"If there’s mainstream FUD surrounding price movement, it’s only intelligent to act oppositely. If enough retail buy or sell a narrative such as “the halving,” then it’s likely that this will not play out next time. It’s almost common sense that whatever everyone does, makes less."
13,"@Punk8621 Never a loss, always a lesson. That’s what you can advise them 😅"
14,"IMO there’s never been a better overall time to invest in a BTC/ETH combo. High enough cap for proof of adoption/future, whilst pumpy vibes are becoming exhausted. Enough time has lapsed moving sideways to suggest a DCA strategy now is a rational bet."

31,How many owners in a project do you really think there are? Here’s some personal trivia. I have Punks spread over more than one address. So do two of my friends who do not have Twitter accounts.

34,"You might think you’d have been better off hodling everything, but staying liquid is also partially how you allocated the positions that took off in the first place. Take some cream off the plate on occasion. Remaining somewhat liquid is not an immature behaviour to possess."
35,"The positive confirmation bias is so strong within NFT community, that you find yourself scratching your head as to how some cannot understand the value proposition. Water, food, shelter, NFT?"
36,@AmitMukherjee Bubble territory.
37,@ryancarson Timezone shifting from Australia to Miami. 4.5 hours. I feel ya..
38,Inheritance stifled the speed of innovation because the decision makers were not necessarily the smartest anymore. Web 3 is an opportunity to “reduce” some of this and increase the rate of technological advancement as a whole.
39,@ryancarson Excitement is a form of sympathetic nervous system activation—aka “stress.” The body struggles to determine between the different types of stresses. Many men have died of heart attacks before a steamy female encounter…I feel you.
40,Looking forward to this. https://t.co/x4iqFjwMtT
41,"@ryancarson There is peace in periods of dedicated anarchy. Occasionally, a lack of routine is almost evolutionary consistent with how humans would have survived in times of uncertainty. This is what I pondered today post meditation."
42,"@ryancarson @XXHeartYou The feasible thesis is that simple. Floor is safety. Info Tech ppl tend to be white more often than other colors (I don’t make this up). IT ppl like Punks. IT ppl buy PFP most often mirror as who they’d like to represent. Forgive my brash, but I’m a truth teller. Well done Sir."
43,@ryancarson @XXHeartYou Your Punk purchase was iconic. Punk hairstyle and popular “race.” Air quotes for those sensitive to data interpretation.
44,@ryancarson Gm. Only saddened the Punk made the PFP for a limited time only. 😅
45,"Dude, @alphasoups is a beast. For someone who entered this space as an investor, not a code native—it’s feels so good to know good people exist everywhere. @0xTycoon has linked many Punks up with great minds and great projects. We thank you also. https://t.co/4GoxGHHgKB"

52,"CryptoPunks. Will they be a hedge against “the crypto crash?” It’s a question many have pondered. Perhaps, if a lengthy bear market (not just a moment) takes place, we might see that."
53,Twitter blue does not align for many in the “PFP pseudonymous identity” case.
54,@Twitter Ready when it’s free
55,@QualityNames_ @nftpres @BoredApeYC Nice profits brother
56,@GolfLaugh Probably.
57,"Unsurprisingly, my NFT Twitter feed is 99.99% of sleazy shills and scams. Yet, as I expected and have received; the other 0.01% of interactions here have been life changing. That makes it worth it. You only have to meet that one person."
58,@SKYCRYPTOBOOMER “Hacked” or …
59,@QualityNames_ Sick ape!
60,"@ryancarson @AmitMukherjee https://t.co/QZ6TMGAd67

In this article, I discussed my original dismay for the BAYC community and even labelled it as “immature.” Yet, I appreciated that sense of tribalism as a pro, not a con in the end. Okay, enough from me. Hope this helps."
61,"@ryancarson @AmitMukherjee Especially Punkollectors. They’re working on other stuff. As I said, many are extremely wealthy due to how early they arrived to Eth, DEFI and Punks itself. Many don’t have time/want to discuss the “trivial” debates like some of the Apes do. I love BAYC, but you can read below:"
62,"@ryancarson @AmitMukherjee Might I add, Punks came after balanced crypto portfolios. And Apes came after that. Despite my/our conviction for Punks and Apes, I still categorize them both as “extreme risk” and thus, they only represent XYZ % of portfolio. Usual, repetitive investor stuff. You know."
63,@ryancarson @AmitMukherjee Then there’s many people like me. We have both BAYC and Punks. We also have other L1s as well as BTC. Diversification thesis is obviously hyper-rational. Crypto is math and rational minds appreciate the science within minutes of hearing about it. Makes sense.
64,@ryancarson @AmitMukherjee BAYC: BAYC: “Cool kids” NFT flex. Less whales &amp; crypto natives holding big bags compared to punks. Narrative seems to be shifting and just might if enough OGs grab one. BAYC may retain provenance thesis too with enough time. Great franchises can bomb anything &amp; retain value.
65,"@ryancarson @AmitMukherjee Punks: Ethereum OG’s fave (many of who don’t even have Twitter). The rare “Dinosaur fossil” of smart contract history. They also love DEFI, so wait for the next summer of profits or further stagnation. Many Punk collectors are extremely wealthy and do not FOMO in or out."
66,@AmitMukherjee Agree with every line Sir. I may only add: that @BoredApeYC may transcend the community and @yugalabs requirement if enough time passes. BAYC being #2 in line may also carry a similar narrative in the long term. Great franchises can bomb anything and retain value.

78,"@cyounessi1 Maybe both? I don’t like to discount the meme. That said, just ETH for me."
79,"This extends beyond just Punks of course. At some point, devs need to recognise that the amount of offers in a Punk or Apes inbox can be overwhelming. Already, we are saturated with offers as everyone looks to capitalise on household projects by creating a derivative $"
80,@cyounessi1 The narrative has been agreed on. SOV status.
81,The caveat for those developing derivative projects for CryptoPunk holders is that a lot of Punks are too wealthy/busy to participate. The investor class of Punks is unlike a lot of “nuanced” projects where community involvement is key. Hodling a Punk is enough for many.
