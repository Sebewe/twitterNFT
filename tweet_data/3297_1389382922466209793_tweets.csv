This will take a long time if I accomplish it but I said the same thing about Mya’s Treasures at 1st"
60,Keep in mind this was all in my Birthday week so what an amazing week that was!!
61,I then created my first pieces and my favorite drawing &amp; painting artist bought the first piece in that collection which was Brain Vomit
62,Thanks to @DataNFT_ &amp; @niftyworld I was able to find someone who linked a platform that allowed me to create an erc-721 collection and now I have created an erc-721 collection.

79,@damedoteth @Ukraine This is really cool
80,@damedoteth I think the reason why someone genuinely ever creates something is that they were frustrated with the other option. So they create the thing they which was there for them. Although some people do this and its not a problem most people have that they fix. Just my opinion though
