1,@KenyaPower_Care I am still without power after 2 days. I was told the technicians would come at 9am. No one came. Then I was told 1030am. Still no one has come. I was told the supervisor will call me. No one has called. You already have my account # in a DM
2,"@KenyaPower_Care I have been bearing with you for 2 days. You continue to say you are addressing the issue, but nothing has been done. The technicians still have not arrived and still no one has called me."
3,@KenyaPower_Care My power is still out after 2 days. You promised to send technicians to repair the broken line and to call me. You haven’t kept any of your promises. My food has spoiled and I can’t pump water to my house. This is unacceptable. I already DM’d my acct # many times
4,The broken line is affecting multiple houses. We are all without power @KenyaPower_Care
5,@KenyaPower_Care A tree branch fell on the powerline to my house. We have no power. Can you kindly come and repair it? I sent a DM with my account number

7,"True. Also, many nonprofits try to hide this and appear noble by accusing dissenters of causing disunity or behaving contrary to their mission. Most “dissenters,” however, are simply explaining how the organization’s incompetence is hurting the mission. https://t.co/vC9mo1c85O"
