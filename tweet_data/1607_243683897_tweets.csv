76,@stormricciotti @scalpihyper @Ephi_BL @ThePixlverse @SappySealsNFT @wabdoteth I think it has to be pretty high move set at this rate...Looks like 2 confirmed top 4 or5 bands here
77,@i_LiveFreeOrDie @wabdoteth likely mid March at this rate but do not hold me to that exactly
78,@klentslogan @Akkukap @wabdoteth @camolNFT @ThePixlverse idk yet tbh

81,"@Akkukap @wabdoteth @camolNFT @ThePixlverse hmmm seems like Slam may be lower band at this point them originally thought
It keeps showing up 3rd row down"
82,@klentslogan @Akkukap @wabdoteth @camolNFT @ThePixlverse this means that GAIA SPIRIT is higher than Slam automatically @Akkukap

84,@Mhecrypto @SappySealsNFT @Ephi_BL @ThePixlverse @wabdoteth yes Cumulonimbus is top rarity band it seems

98,"@scalpihyper the 4 moves are confirmed but to get any of the other moves it will be min .7E...These were the only cheap confirmed deity moves
No more thought both were bought now so the floor for confirmed deity moves is .7E now"
99,@card_saint I mean I bought the only other confirmed deity move maybe 15 min ago
