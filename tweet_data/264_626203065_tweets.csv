4,@spectatorindex I mean they could just leave loool
5,@0x_fxnction Bro if you ain’t got that high intensity capital you are just ngmi
6,@ZA1J1N Definitely some red flags here
7,@ItzBermuda Ignoring the hype is a superpower.
8,**also had to buy these for tax reasons - otherwise it would probably stay in ETH/JPEGS .
9,"Bought $TSLA &amp; $HURA at the open. The narrative of renewable energy is no longer just around climate change - it’s a matter of freedom and independence from nation states built on oil.

And whether we like it or not, the future of energy is Nuclear."
10,"Man if you hate #NFTs… 2022 is going to be a tough year to get though.

We’re going to be seeing some huge announcements &amp; releases this year as big-tech embraces crypto.

Personally, I think the @Shopify integration will be the most game-changing."
11,@AzukiSales Finally this one getting the respect deserves. One of the best in the collection!
12,@ianip_ @doodles The trading volume on the ships alone would be insane. Now I’m not sure you get that same effect. It will be interesting to watch unfold.
13,@it_me_kat @doodles Hahahaha super cute
14,@0x_Retirement This is sickkk
15,"Not that my opinion matters because I own zero @Doodles:

But #SpaceDoodles would have actually worked really well as a dilutive collection. If you could freely trade ships/suits, own multiple for your doodle etc. 

They would just need a func. to swap your doodle into the ship."
16,@BoredApeYC Damn this looks good
17,@frankynines Hahahaha this is the best one!
18,@backuardo @birthmark_tv @AzukiZen Love it! Did u make it yourself?
19,"A bit late, but finally trying out NFT Fi. Pretty cool service and I can see this area growing massively over the next few years. Crypto/NFT ""credit scores"" will probably be very important in the future, so it might not be a bad idea to start building it now."
20,Incredible thread. https://t.co/Mslu3WJOaY
21,@spectatorindex REKT
22,@ArcanicNFT Perfect
23,@DiscoverXnft Hahah fk that’s quality
24,@VitalikButerin @M_Simonyan @akarlin0 Vitalik the GOAT
25,"Putin is in a bad position right now imo. 

His options are:
- Negotiate: bad timing, looks weak, lose leverage
- Carpet bombing: desperate, terrible optics, lose support
- Continue urban warfare: long &amp; costly, sanctions bleed

Still, it would be unwise to underestimate him."
26,@0xPyrrhic Haha dodge a bullet for sure. Still can’t believe they sold 10k of these for 3 ETH.. insane!
27,"@Bamedi_ @AzukiZen Bald OP, everyone knows"

36,@OttoSuwenNFT Yooooooo ☠️
37,@WhosNFT Sickkk! I am insanely jealous. Wanted to order one now but it won't arrive till April-May 😭
38,"However, analysis like this does give me hope that the Russian military is not as equipped for this war as they might be posturing. Russia alone can prevent a war by ending this conflict now before more lives are lost.

https://t.co/ldP3q3S8ok"
39,"In this moment I’m reminded of Bill Ackman saying in early 2020 that the virus was being underestimated and not priced correctly in markets.

I feel the same way with the Russian conflict. I’m not seeing an easy way out. SWIFT is the last card to play before escalation."
40,@Ape7068 @Apple @BoredApeYC 😂
41,"The Azuki floor price really only tells one story. Many trait combinations are slowly getting bought and locked away.

For example, looking at LISTED Blues &amp; Reds:
- 4 Katanas
- 2 Sakura Katanas
- 1 Leather Katana
- No Tactical Knives

What other rare combinations have you found?"
42,@LeBrownJames_ No lie I had it long before the flexagon just for the undo feature. My tweets would be 10x even dumber without it

46,"@thenftwitch @bobubeanfarmer Congrats!

Also did Bobu always have that nice banner art? Is that original or from an Anime 😮"
47,@prox__centauri @shanicucic96 @neotokyonewstv Still got the 24/7 VC? Considering jumping back in soon(ish)
48,"@iamashchild Better yet, would be a method for holders to open a request for a token return and it was put to vote by the NFT holders. Might have its own problems but could be worth exploring."
49,"@iamashchild In which case, it might just be easier to authorize the creator to control all token transfers so they can send a#the stolen token back to the original address. However some might see that as giving too much power to the creator and a form of centralization."
50,@iamashchild I think it’s possible. There would have to be an invokable function that takes a token ID and adds it to a ban list which prevents it from transferring. The method could also take in an address for which a new one is minted. This would have to be permitted for the creator only.
51,"@Rewkang @NizzyNFT @BoredApeYC Its not unreasonable. In order to hit a $3B FDV it would essentially have to be a top 50-ish coin. Is that doable? For the #1 NFT brand in the game? I think so. Granted, I have no idea what the expected utility is of the token."
52,"@pixeldoshi I need this 👀 
When does it go on sale?"
53,@Soylent_Lament Activated.
54,RT @YourAnonOne: The Anonymous collective is officially in cyber war against the Russian government. #Anonymous #Ukraine
55,"@Degentraland @doodles @BoredApeYC Great thread. But nah, it's Azuki."
56,@thehejz @CyberFrogzNFT Yooo those are nice
57,RT @AzukiZen: The story unfolds soon...
58,"Ppl complaining about sweepers celebrating their “cheap” buys should probably just be grateful the liquidity exists at all.

I’d say NFT markets are still pretty forgiving right now, could get worse."
59,"@Uberflux @projectPXN @dexd0x @reicannon Ight I want in, but I have no clue what to do 😅"
60,"Also, plz triple check that anyone claiming to be a Ukrainian artist has a history of work &amp; activity.

It is, unfortunately, an easy thing to scam."
61,"Two sides of the same coin:

 “Why do you care about x during a war”

“Stick to x, I don’t come here to read politics”"
62,"RT @elliotrades: Life is precious, so is peace. 

All the problems in crypto land seem tiny now. 

Praying for those in danger."

65,@AlphaMerlion @InvsbleFriends Yea pretty messed ngl
66,@NathanCRoth Yea that ratio is crazy and should not be underestimated
67,@CyberFrogzNFT Excited for my legendaries
68,"I feel so relaxed not having anything to do with Invisible Friends. 

Don’t get me wrong I’d love 10 ETH - but the stress of holding? 

Nahhh I can’t"

72,"@AstonDreamz @danielgothits Good, guess the information I had was wrong."
73,@danielgothits @AstonDreamz Also the charity is.. suspect to say the least..
74,"@xAli7_ hahaha yea, or that 😂"
75,This auction alone might bring back the bull market. https://t.co/almzKAtTeP
76,@coffee1celatte Sheeeeesh! 🔥
77,RT @ian__major: Do you see what's at stake anon? https://t.co/o06IReGVIs
78,@prancoisback Agreed! I'll take a volatile floor over a stagnant one if it means more ppl are joining in.
79,"There we go... that's how we get volume back. I never worry about floor prices, only volume. Let floor prices fall to where there is volume. https://t.co/PYYLB0ntht https://t.co/rwgxPy3C9w"
80,@JustBrianEth @AzukiZen Incredible!
81,"@nftfren Better than Meka, not quite as big as Doodles - imo"
82,"@nftfren Doodles. The art is great and one of the first really well animated projects. Theres also a lot of identity in the traits, I think ppl will find ones they resonate with. With Meka, everything looks pretty much the same so there is no attachment."
83,"@peerfan @DiscoverXnft Haha yea I was thinking the same thing. To us, a low sale would seem bearish. But the general public, this will seem insane either way!"
84,"So far February has been:
- Hacks, exploits, &amp; scams
- Huge liquidity drains (in form of DA mints)
- Disappointing deliveries from Blue Chip pfps
- Global Macro FUD

All in all, this actually makes me quite bullish for when sentiment turns around. Might be days, weeks, or months."
85,"Azuki holding that 11.8 despite low volume is bullish. Thought we would’ve seen ~10 by now. 

InvisibleFriends will probably be stealing the spotlight for a while but will hopefully bring increased volume for the whole market."
86,@AzukiZen uh oh Bobu’s in trouble man
87,@timkimm @AzukiZen Dope!
88,@robbyhammz @AzukiZen We here
89,"@danielgothits Ridiculous man. They’ve lost it.

Canadian banks have a stranglehold on the govt. No doubt the outflows to crypto have them freakin out."
90,@ArnoldPoernomo @CyberFrogzNFT @pixeldoshi Agreed. This is the $SOL 🤝 $ETH cross-over project we needed.

95,@DmacNFT @takoa__ I just buy anything Pixeldoshi touches and it’s worked out so far 🤷‍♂️
96,"Ahh yes, I love having the Azuki sales bot back up and running.

Nice work @gjohnsx! https://t.co/0CYhUqkmdK"
97,"Definitely got my eyes on @CyberFrogzNFT.

@pixeldoshi doesn’t miss."
98,@danielgothits Can’t agree with this enough..
99,@Havoc_The_Red @EB7 @AzukiZen Somehow.. this weapon seems appropriate for a devil. Such a sick Azuki
