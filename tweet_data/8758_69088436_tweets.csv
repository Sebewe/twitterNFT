22,"@nft_dreww @garyvee People like “fuck rugs” then turn a rug into a meme and drive its price up to 8 eth and make them more money, fucking mind boggling."
23,@illaDaProducer Preach
24,@aescapism @Helloimmorgan @OnChainTV @KB_KristinBlake @duncanbrazzil @henrykaiser So glad I made this tweet now
25,“Pi-ner-nih-err” sound in ‘Killing me softly” is almost as equally important as well. Either or is perfect.

36,"@a_pie21 @PNCBank Yeah, this shit is ridiculous. I don’t like being told who and where I can spend my money. It’s my fucking money. Lost out on a few nice jumps waiting on CB to clear funds and Moonpay eating shit sending me in circles."
37,So tired of BofA/Chase when it comes to anything #crypto related. What’s a Crypto-friendly online bank where I have access to fiat if I ever need it? Still just CB with a debit card?

52,Really needs to get easier to buy #ethereum - faster.
53,"Having an 8 month old sick baby is so tough, not cause she is irate and unconsolable, but because she can’t tell me what will help and I can’t take her pain / discomfort away."

64,"@chadw_eth @GirliesNFT I have several wallets and tend to spread things around, but I just picked up two that my wife liked :) https://t.co/H3fVSv512t"
65,"If @niftygateway was a better marketplace and more people offered their projects on there... I'd probably be in a lot of trouble, but would at least own a lot more jpegs."
