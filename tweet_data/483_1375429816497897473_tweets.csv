53,"@JAYTUSK The beauty of the metaverse, is that physics and structural limitation do not exist! Those doors can absolutely open up and portal somewhere else. My thesis, is that every space/lootpod is going to be connected to the @nike @RTFKTstudios"

96,@PabloPunkasso Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnndddddddddddd now!
97,@golfer319 @Crazy_Skullz @nftworldsNFT We commissioned their @nftworldsNFT build and are actively helping to make sure it’s as good as it gets! @MMMVirtual
98,@golfer319 @Crazy_Skullz @nftworldsNFT Not a rug pull at all. Very active community and @PrepsToThePros and a few other friends are part of the community. Highly undervalued for a while and I think their @nftworldsNFT presence is what’s making people take notice and scoop them up.
99,@antalegui @OnTheBull That’s one smooth MF’er!
