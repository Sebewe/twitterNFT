8,"@pgmoraitis @opt1m3 You're such a lil' revolutionary... You're absolutely right -there's a big difference between providing constructive criticism, and pointing out problems, and warranting a timeout. 
Censoring  is probably the worst thing one can do to a 'client' who has invested in their product."

12,What a beautiful story. Don't let NFTs 'be' your life. Let them 'be part of it'; and let them enrich it in more ways than providing social status on twitter and discord. https://t.co/zxckgRyQ5U
