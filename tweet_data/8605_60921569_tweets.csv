37,"@edoppai Once I pay off my loan on abra in the next few days, I’m headed over to FTM. I had already experimented with the blockchain with Spartacus Finance DAO."
38,"@edoppai Correct, I’m actually already doing that now. In order to redirect the wmemo to other staking opportunities that are presumably less risky then leveraging."
39,"@edoppai My understanding and I may be wrong, but if you use wmemo as collateral for a loan on abracadabra then those tokens cannot be used for other staking products. Again I’m not an expert, but that’s what I understand."

41,@foppishrake @btcgummydrops @danielesesta I don’t believe this. Time will tell of course.
42,@edoppai Not financial advice. I would go lower. Always keep your percentages between 60% to 70%. I’m sitting at 57% now and I’m gonna move some assets around to get above 60% that should bring down my liquidation to around the high $400s low 500… That’s a bet I’m willing to make..

45,"@btcgummydrops @danielesesta If the mission is to empower the little frogs, I am losing sight of it. All I see is Wall Street part 2. The treasury should’ve safe guarded the frogs and bought back at the intrinsic value countering the evil frog. Then I can say your “nice”"
46,"@btcgummydrops @danielesesta My question is a simple one. Who holds enough wMemo to dump the price over 40%, liquidating frogs that set a liquidation price below the buyback price? I understand that leverage is a risk of that a frog assumes but there is a difference between mindless leverage and educated."
