any evidence for the OS protocol being broken to this degree? really?

61,"@flanvel @CryptoAussie @dguido everyone is currently buzzing about this particular case, this discussion is taking place in a twitter thread pertaining to this specific case.

you're obfuscating facts by saying ""protocols have vulnerabilities, therefore, this was entirely an opensea protocol failure"""
62,"@flanvel @CryptoAussie @dguido uh huh... except in this case the only way these OpenSea assets were stolen, was via a message signed by the end users.  

Action by end users resulted in this and other opensea exploits, you're implying a fatal flaw in the opensea protocol which just isn't the case."
63,"@flanvel @CryptoAussie @dguido care to explain more because what you posted amounts to a nothing of an explanation.  

what ""user data"" can a contract be exploited to cough up exactly?"
64,"@flanvel @CryptoAussie @dguido ""log in with the stolen data"" ??? 

I don't think you understand how this works. 

If you phish someone into signing a malicious message, you didn't ""login to another users opensea account using stolen data"""
65,"@ajlardner95 @CryptoAussie @flanvel @dguido what opensea data are you referring to?  it's an open protocol, if you sign a malicious message permitting OpenSea to sell your listing to another party for $0, that's mostly on the end user."
66,"@NFTshinobii what do you mean ""due to current breaches?""

it's likely this theft was entirely your own end-user error. 

you moved it to a new wallet and it still got breached? think you need to audit your machine / network immediately."
67,"@the_token_house It's clear by looking at onchain analysis of what took place that users signed a malicious order. OpenSeq was not hacked, users were merely exploited into signing something  they shouldn't have"
68,"@HH_Clowd @OlgaRodinaNFT @opensea Look it's important to understand what connecting your wallet means.

This is nothing new. You're likely not at any more risk playing with opensea NFTs today as you were yesterday."
70,@molly0xFFF Precisely why people need to stop panicking over misinformation they read online and rushing to revoke permissions they don't understand and likely are not even compromised over.
71,"@flanvel @dguido Mostly FUD. Opensea has never been hacked as you describe, every incident you're thinking of including this latest one was at least partially user error."
72,"@RockinRLLR Merely connecting your wallet to a website doesn't put you in any danger. 

If you're surfing the real https://t.co/xBQH1akrJh website you're likely totally fine"

75,"@revolut20 disconnecting wallet does nothing.

if you are among the minority of users effected, revoking   your opensea approvals would be a good idea."

did you recall opening an email from opensea which had you sign a message to ""migrate listings""?"
