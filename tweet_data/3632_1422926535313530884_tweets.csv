19,@ZacHeenok 🤝
20,Did not buy Azuki because I thought they would dip after reveal. Did not buy mfers because I thought it is just another meme that will die after a week. Did not buy NFT Worlds because I thought trying to make money with an old game is stupid. Follow me for NFT trading advice.

39,"@johnnymidlife @psychedelic_nft @CryptoMories @BAYC2745 It's pretty impressive and also a little insane given the short time the project exists.
