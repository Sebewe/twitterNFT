49,"9/ You can learn more via our docs: https://t.co/7Qo5s6hTDW

And we have some very cool launches planned for y'all soon - stay tuned! 😀"
50,"8/ Anyway, for now we invite any NFT DAO who wants to empower their DAO members meaningfully, to come and chat with us. 

The SZNS platform also has a lot of room for growth, and we're working on new features (hopefully good) as we prepare for a public launch. Our DMs are open"
51,"7/ We recognize governance needs of DAOs will evolve, and we plan to evolve too.

For example, we don't believe small multisigs are bad per se. A DAO can reasonably want to appoint leaders who can perform unilateral actions in a scoped capacity (and we plan to support this 👀)"
52,"6/ Again, a lot of this seems to be re-examinations of political theory (we're like in the aristotle age) while tackling technical challenges involved with allowing DAOs to perform actions given tradeoffs, e.g. from our own @OKDunc: https://t.co/qSDlAfbddH"
53,"5/ That's not to say this model is perfect (or even ideal).

There are many outstanding Qs:
- Is plutocratic voting good enough?
- What is proper quorum for execution - 51%, 75%, 80%?
- How do you act quickly in a ""decentralized"" manner?
- How to defend against malicious actors?"
54,"4/ As mentioned, NFT DAOs on @sznsNFT operate in a governance framework where a proposal is voted on offchain via snapshot and then sent to reality.eth for execution on-chain. 

The NFTs in treasury (what we call the Album) are managed by all tokenholders, not a small multisig."
55,"3/ Imo, much of the coordination challenges that DAOs face today are a repeat of corporate governance that has largely been explored already

BUT this time we have codified incentives and provenance via tokens, presenting unique opportunities for collective assembly and ownership"
56,"2/ But it's not that simple.

While most NFT ""DAOs"", like @ApeDao_, are in fact managed by a small multisig of a handful of individuals despite our attempt to navigate away from trust-based systems in web3, it's often out of necessity because DAO coordination is actually hard"
57,"1/ There's a lot to unravel here and idk if a tweet thread will suffice but..

NFT DAOs deployed on @sznsNFT (so far @divine_dao and @MeebitsDAO's sub-DAO) are a ""truer"" DAO in the sense that any DAO member/ERC20 tokenholder can make a proposal that can get executed on-chain. https://t.co/aZvH1DRiAp"
58,"@DennisonBertram @jjperezaguinaga @voteWithTally @gnosisPM @auryn_macmillan Or NFT DAOs deployed via @sznsNFT, where the NFTs are held in a gnosis multisig (what we call an Album) and the ERC20 holders actually can have their proposals executed wrt to the NFTs held in that Album"
59,"DAOs are a hard thing to build for, esp as the concept of a DAO continues to evolve quickly

So we focus on what matters most specifically to NFT DAOs, working on a platform that's both user-friendly but also enables meaningful decentralized coordination. Steadily and surely. https://t.co/cJmJHPjEke"

67,"10k pfp idea:
-every NFT starts with blank slate of traits
-each trait does have a spectrum of rarity and qualities
-user must earn each trait based on game or challenge
-thus NFT's rarity can be earned and changed over time
-allows for more flexible user input on pfp composition"
