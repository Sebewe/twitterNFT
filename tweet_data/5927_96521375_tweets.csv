1,@itsdanataylor I’ll be cowering in the corner with all my BAYC hoodie wearing bros.
2,@iamchillpill Let’s do it
3,@itstylersays Let’s gooooo!
4,@Richenks @0n1Force Those who have stayed loyal to 0n1 will be rewarded.

6,Looking pretty chill.  @iamchillpill https://t.co/k8gccwlEQG
7,Dope. https://t.co/pND8dCr2ea
8,Are you thinking about launching an NFT project?  You might want to talk to a lawyer before investing any time or resources into it to make sure your team can be held accountable if things go sideways.  The grass is always green in the beginning.
9,@andrwwang @AndrewYang Studly
10,"@KillTheBuzz @0n1Force I still love the art. That will never change and it’s the reason I bought an 0n1 in the first place. If you don’t like the direction of the project, sell and move on. No one is stopping you."
11,My favorite thing about NFTs? They give me a reason to spontaneously meet up with a random group of brilliant and beautiful people to talk Web3 over Korean food. @SunNongDan https://t.co/KVREnm0rPS
12,@MattFeinbergEsq @shtbrns @dratinl_nft @andrwwang Keep me in the loop.
13,"@SGB6637 Ideally you’d name a trustee, even a specialized trustee just for crypto assets, to access / liquidate / distribute your JPEGs."
14,"@SGB6637 Assuming you’re an adult, you would at least want a will and trust that names your parents as beneficiaries, and possibly even trustees, of your estate. Without a trust, the state could force your parents to probate your estate, which can be a huge headache. (Not legal advice)."
15,Do you have an estate plan (wills and trusts) to protect your crypto + NFTs in the case of incapacitation or worse? Most people don’t think of this stuff until they’re old but teens are amassing sizable estates in Web3. Should be something to 🤔. DM me with questions.
16,@MattFeinbergEsq @dratinl_nft @andrwwang There should be. I’d be happy to participate.
17,@MattFeinbergEsq @dratinl_nft @andrwwang You can build a house on your own with a couple buds from college or you could hire professionals to design and engineer it.
18,@MattFeinbergEsq @dratinl_nft @andrwwang Agreed. Hire attorneys before the mess happens. The clean up is the costly part. I’m an attorney in Los Angeles in case anyone needs help 😎
19,@russ_rahsel @trueIMCMPLX 0n1 will rise again. Just wait and see 👀
20,Cool Pets or Dead Frenz?
21,GM ❤️
22,@jaifox16 100%. Legends have been made with truth and hard work alone.
23,@MattSteffanina Giving me a reason to meet up with complete strangers from all walks of life and feeling totally comfortable about it. And anything BAYC related 😂
24,@NFTLlama @ThanosHAHAHA Let’s goooo!
25,Let’s go ladies https://t.co/K9rBjUqeXM
26,Wen Alt Season?
27,GM to all my beautiful @sad_girls_bar holders who have been supportive since day 1. Glad the NFT world is waking up to appreciate the amazing community that @GlamBeckettArt has built. Women led projects on the run. #LFG https://t.co/2lsWFI3Vm3
28,@uBerlygirl I’m a CA attorney and a supporter of women led NFT projects. My wife is an artist from Japan working on a hand drawn NFT project that will support breast cancer prevention and LGBTQ inclusion. Would love to get your feedback. She could use support from other women in the space.
29,@Cryptoologyy @0n1Force 0n1 is still a blue chip project. Coinbase wouldn’t have partnered with it if it didn’t see potential. A new team will be formed that will take the Enclave back to the moon where it belongs.
30,@LowlyLyricist @0n1Force 0n1 is working on big thangs. Still hold a bunch.

44,Has anyone else aped into @DystoApez ? Incredible team that is working their butts off. Each Ape comes with a free VX model to use in their expansive Metaverse in Sandbox (coming soon). Passive staking for every ape you own. Great alpha in their discord too 👀 https://t.co/B0QXs1tUEG
45,@DystoApez Love it. Just got me a pet bot.
46,@CryptoAJ_777 @0n1Force @jonathan_CrimCo Love this
47,"I’m happy to see that established woman-led NFT projects have been gaining momentum this week. I have been a supporter of @sad_girls_bar since day 1 and continue to be impressed by the strength, kindness, and integrity of their community. Let’s go ladies! #sadgirlsbar https://t.co/ZadeA6JZBM"
48,"I just watched The Eternals on Disney Plus. Terrible jokes that must have been written for children, sappy K-Drama-like romance, an unbearably long run time, and Jon Snow. My kind of movie."
49,@therennverse @crypto_coven @worldofwomennft @sad_girls_bar We are sad to have you 🍕🍷 https://t.co/idwefvBjmI
50,@DystoApez Would love to see @0n1Force whose characters live in a dystopian world

53,@kas__vegas I like GN but what about all the amazing time between GM and GN? Maybe GAF?
54,@GEORGIASINCLAIR The most “alpha” man I know would never in a million years proclaim himself as an alpha male. He would be embarrassed to say such a thing. Can’t say the same for myself since I am a legend in my own mind 😂
55,@NicoleBehnam @GEORGIASINCLAIR Agreed. 1000%

74,"@smellysatoshi @DApeWives I’m all for collecting more DAWs but, out of respect for the strong female community supporting this incredible project, we should refrain from using terms that may be derogatory to women such as “harem”. Just my 2 cents. Love your new DAW btw!"
