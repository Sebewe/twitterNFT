1,"40 people shared their rent data with @HelloRentSmart from this Reddit post. 

I think it’s time to explore data collection and validation at scale. https://t.co/2pAb8FsRFI"
2,@vintrotweets @BrownieEth @vyperlang @ApeFramework But I should totally get around to trying out those modules
3,"@vintrotweets @BrownieEth @vyperlang @ApeFramework Long story short, but the charts that run on @HelloRentSmart are updated monthly by an old JavaScript script I built. I now live with the technical debt and don’t want to rebuild it in Python right now. It’s the only non Python script I use"
4,I do not like JavaScript
5,@vintrotweets @AnastasiaU @SimonOstrovsky Great read. Unfortunately most of US media is only interested in headlines and ratings.
6,Would love for some @SimonOstrovsky vice videos documenting what is going on on the ground Ukraine. Fantastic journalist.
7,"RT @paulapivat: A common question we get @banklessDAO is

&gt; How many active contributors do we have? 

Turns out, this isn't as straight fo…"
8,"Thinking about the big picture though, there are larger and more pressing problems in the world. I am thinking about the people of Ukraine today."
9,"The cool thing about @HelloRentSmart is that we are using @gregisenberg's approach of unbundling reddit while working to solve real problems in web3. 

This is so fun."
10,"I love the feedback we get from reddit when we share @HelloRentSmart updates.

https://t.co/fQswCV4Ljw"
11,Life is just an infinite stream of marketing emails and iOS notifications
12,@chriscantino Check out @HelloRentSmart. This describes our approach
13,"RT @chriscantino: The next breakout web3 product won’t be branded as web3

It’ll simply be useful"
14,"At first, I was fairly open about what we are doing, but then it seemed like the person was taking notes and admitted him and his friend want to take a different approach on this somewhere else. 

Feeling stressed about this, because I want to build openly."
15,"Because most of @HelloRentSmart 's traffic come from reddit, not all of them are aware of the web3 community owned and built ethos, so I think this is something I have to be cautious about.

I look for people who want to contribute and not siphon value out of the community."
16,"Just had a really interaction in the @HelloRentSmart discord.

Seemed like someone is trying to copy what we are doing in another city. 

Anyone have any advice on how to handle being very open about what you are doing vs trying to not have people copy what you are doing?"
17,"@paulapivat This isn’t exactly EV.. but might be of interest

32,"@ryancarson It really does take a few months in the space to evaluate quality projects, and even then, it’s still super difficult. Minting is the way to go, but I’m starting to think what are blue chips that I can acquire and be comfortable holding long term"

40,"@HelloRentSmart is now tracking rent trends at over 200 buildings in Denver. This was a big achievement for us, but it's really just the start. 

There are more buildings, more insights, and more solutions we can provide.

All of this will be powered by data and people. https://t.co/oPqkUsLojL"
41,@JackSpallone Are there any active growing TCRs one should know?
42,"If you are interested in getting involved, DM me and let’s talk!

I’m excited to add value to the @oceanprotocol ecosystem and educate the growing community we have on data ownership, monetization, and data unions."

45,@rashad0101 Gm!
46,"I own around 20 NFTs, 2 of them gained enough value to make me have an unrealized profit overall.

I’ve seen bad projects and good projects, and have been exposed to so much through each community. 

The real value has been owning all 20 of them to learn how this space works."
47,@ryancarson It’s all about users owning and monetizing their own data! This looks awesome

55,"@HelloRentSmart's funding proposal is officially up on @oceanpearlio.  

This funding round there are 34 projects seeking a total of $307k in funding, when there is only $100k USD available.

At the same time I got stuck investing in a fraud by @ClarkApallo. Guy closed the discord server down and deleted the Twitter. I wonder who that guy really is…"

What’s different this time around is the people who believe won’t turn a blind eye again."

72,I love Softr but I am fully ingrained in #web3 and can only think about how the product is built with direct feedback from the community members being active in the Slack channel. I’ve been there giving feedback on the product since it launched on product hunt. https://t.co/Z6vfmI5jiV
73,"Coded up a new script for @HelloRentSmart this weekend. Going to be able to add 300+ buildings where we track rent trends. 

This is just the beginning of the data we collect. 

Excited to add more data and start creating content to grow the project’s audience."
