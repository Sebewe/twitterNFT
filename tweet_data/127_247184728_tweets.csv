12,"@TookbyJonathan I think the current trend is already fading away. As it becomes more unprofitable to mint every project you get WL for, people will stop doing it."
13,@KingBlackBored Kevin is such a good marker for this era of shitty cash grabs and rugs within the market though.
14,"Logos look dope, but who decided to name the GCG team Kingpins instead of Gutter Cats? 

Missed opportunity for exposure. https://t.co/uRAY6yCIsM"
15,@stikman Do you mean you sold a bunch of stuff you already owned to get 18.5 ETH liquid?
16,"They look dope, but it’s honestly a terrible idea. https://t.co/tx4uFlXFNq"
17,@himynameisalec People thinking it's a standard airdrop.  Will probably see a few others make the same mistake tbh.
18,Another one gone for 7 ETH. https://t.co/jxr77WcO4H

27,"@Crohnie77 @MrNakaboto @GutterCatGang Full set holders will have additional utility at some point. This rewards long term holders that held a cat since very early and minted the free species too. 

This would also help the individual species because people with just cats or another species will be buying the others."
28,"@GutterCatGang Going to throw my theory in. This has to do with $gang wars. Having a full set will give you bonus tokens. By having a full set, plus something else you’ll get a mech or something to help in the $gang wars."
29,"@himynameisalec Yeah, same here. Didn’t end up using it much so my airdrop was pretty minimal."
30,WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!!! https://t.co/Lqj3hL2nJF
31,@himynameisalec I think it’s because I was planning on trying to create and sell NFT’s when I first joined. Rarible had one of the best interfaces for me. I only ended up buying a couple things off there though. Both of which are worth nothing now lol.

93,It’s been decided. I’m buying a @3landersNFT.
94,"@landonloophole @BoardApes For sure. I’m not saying it is a derivative, but I think people could hold off on buying because they think they’re too similar. I think people are buying 3landers because they seem to have more of their own unique look. 

Just my opinion. I own neither btw."
