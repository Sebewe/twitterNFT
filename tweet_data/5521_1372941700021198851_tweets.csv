3,"@liquiddensity Ha for the record, I was the late ape and I sent the alpha"
4,@_miketriumph_ Exactly
5,If you're going to meet an Ape @ 4:20 and you are going to be late atleast send the alpha that made you late to them in a DM so they can DYOR on your tardiness

8,"The trees in the leak are underrated. 

That is where we hang when not in the clubhouse."
9,"@healingvisions That is a good question. Economics is what attracted me to crypto, so the knowledge of that and tech lead me here. For those looking to learn more, learning macro monetary policies (M1/M2) that the Fed imposed over the past 20-30 years will teach you a ton of the levers."
10,"Be good with economics, be open-minded and progressive with art, be positive, be the best communicator in every interaction, understand the technology and the way it can engage with your future customers and have a plan. 

If you aren't that...find a team that can check the boxes"
11,You can be direct with the value prop of why a user should use their wallet but the majority of y'all just go with the flow and use the term 'connect'?
12,"Some people think they are ending a conversation when they say,“I just don’t get it.” 

That’s when I start the strat tbh."

23,"Proud of this stable, @wakeandbayc has been whipping these horses into a complicated unit that plays well across a variety of races. 160+ horses and a 10% win rate across the stable while maintaining the horses and not selling consistently is 🤯 https://t.co/dvGqEBqRkB"
24,"Racing a car to the mtn this AM, they pop out afterward,”Oh shit, you’re an ape?” 

“Yes ma’am and you whip like it too..”

I swear I have the weirdest encounters with this hoodie.

Last time it was a relative of the first artist I ever collected."

36,PSA: It’s called Swamp Money now
37,@financenewsguy i’d def buy an NFT of my ape giving other specific pfps a wedgie. i’d also buy back every pfp giving my pfps wedgies.
38,"In other words 💎🙌 hodlers aren’t going anywhere, they aren’t motivated by the 15% discount in the gov bill, they are 1100x up on their asset and can stomach a -70% dip at any given moment. 

Long timeframes are minting new whales. 

Any event adding oppty @ upside hardens 🙌"
39,"For those that are holding BAYC apes until 4/29 for LT CGz, the 15% savings will offset any dips in gov bill scrambles.

In order to experience LT CGz you’ve had to go through a 2 mnth build to 10 Ξ, 3🐻 markets and 2💥 🐂 runs, we’ve had @ min 2 moments to justify a 15% hit"
40,For those that flipped a ton they will likely decide to sell some assets to cover those gov bills. This is a large part of the market. BAYC assets are the best buoy and the % of BAYC assets sold of the entire capitulation is likely sub 20% and that’s an aggressive assumption.
41,"A 3 bang on my view of BAYC capitulation given tax deadlines and long term cap gains 👇

TL;DR 

Long timeframes are minting new whales."
42,"correction: 

“…has only *emotional* volatility as an intrinsic value."
43,I consider $ape a complicated variable that has only volatility as an intrinsic value

51,Is this what a grail feels like?
52,I will bet against easy logic that doesn't account for time all day long.
53,"Yo so when monitoring this over 14 days, it didn't end up holding for the full 14 days.

73,@HammerZ_NFT The distro is a lock
74,"The most seasoned NFT veterans rn can't explain to you what just went down. 

They didn't put the time into the WL shenanigans cause they had logic and plans deployed elsewhere. 

The WL shenanigans are paying massive ROI rn. 

We are upside down rn, and its not a bad thing."
75,"I’m super sorry. 

I don’t mean to be this prescriptive but if you think a handful of whales can tell you what will happen at a macro level with illiquid jpegs idk what type of insight you’re actually trying to seek."
76,"Some people love the new trippy M3, some people find it underwhelming. 

Remember there’s always a buyer out there that overvalues a NFT token more than the market consensus says they should, and that is okay. In fact, that’s what makes this space special."
77,"Consider it the cost to be buying in the presence of diamond handed kongs for a fraction of the gas wars that will go down during public mint.
