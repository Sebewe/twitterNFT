74,"@farokh 🤣 i just tweeted about this haha we're on the same page. these pfp minting prices are getting ridiculous. 

if they want more money, deliver a good project and collect the royalties. simple as that"
75,"@chibiapegang yep, and it's so easy to slightly increase and pass it off as okay. great teams and projects have released for far less than .1, doodles being an exception. 

if they want more money - that's what the royalties are for. deliver a successful project and you'll get paid"
76,"@chibiapegang there are exceptions ofc, but the pfp mint prices are increasing every month and there's no reason for it. new creators and the buyers really think this is okay"
77,"pfp projects that exceed 0.1 mint price =🚩
this is pure greed and not good for the space"

97,"@PAGESVFX to burn, do you put your address and the ID here? https://t.co/tBF1qwRtSo"
98,@PAGESVFX interesting... im going to play around with these. low gas is perfect for projects like this
99,@PAGESVFX oh for real? so by staking it burns the nft? still reading up on the project. i want to mint those 2k-10ks
