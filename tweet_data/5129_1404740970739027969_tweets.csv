83,I believe the market will pay more attention to Buck Teeth after Hoodies/Top Hats/Cowboys' run.
84,Buck Teeth is the 2nd rarest male attribute (78 punks in total). Punk #6502 is the cleanest (imo) albino bucktooth in the collection.
85,"Just fractionalized Punk #6502 using https://t.co/upMKkulBQp. Started liquidity at Buck Teeth floor (84E implied valuation). Reserve set at 115E but open to suggestions! Thanks @DeezeFi  for the inspiration!
