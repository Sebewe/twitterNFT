0,@TroyFitzpatric What are your thoughts on deploying to L2's such as arbitrum and optimism?
1,"Last bear market I saw all my coins drop to 0. This bear market I'm sitting mostly in stables and enjoying cool NFT art airdrops from @TroyFitzpatric. 

My pfp is a script breaker, all script breakers recently got airdropped a free Ugly Math Ape. Here is the one I got: https://t.co/fwPAesZKVt"
2,@CanteringClark L2 Scaling.
3,"I'm not bearish cause I think crypto is a scam, I'm bearish because the market hasn't valued certain projects appropriately."
4,"- A small basket of NFT projects (ENS, Gods)
- Decentralized Exchanges (UNI)
- Decentralized Lending (AAVE)
- Decentralized Stable-Coins (DAI)
- Decentralized Banks/Savings (YFI)

Now go through the top coins and look to see if the general market is valued appropriately."
5,"Let's ignore macro for a moment and analyse the crypto space as a whole. What has been created that meaningfully impacts consumers in a positive way on top of a blockchain. I can think of a couple really cool projects:
- Polygon Sidechain
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
..."
6,@sowmaler @epolynya Can u outline in a theoritical sense how this is possible?
7,"@GuardAOR @0xVins @notapornfolder_ Nothing at all happened, bitcoin and crypto as a whole was completely ignored, no buyers on the books at all. After 6months of boredom nobody could be assed to save the price."
8,"So you see shit like this on the daily, you go out to the pub and people tell you cool camels are going to 100eth, ur portfolio has done a 20x the previous year. You still think we see ath any time soon? https://t.co/THmD7tOILH"
9,"@taha_crypto1 I have 3 and they are great, one of them sits in a safe in an undisclosed location as cold storage, the other is what I use to play around with arbitrum and optimism. The final is what links to jacksanderson.eth. It's the only place I'm comfortable storing anything major."
10,"Remember when micro-strategy bought a boat load of bitcoin, then everyone thought that all the major tech firms would continue to do it. Then not a single major company proceeded to do so in any meaningful way.
Not Google, Facebook, Apple, Netflix, whatever."
11,Twitter has been so dead as of late. Maybe this might be the time to get some work done.
12,bullish at resistance again.
13,@taha_crypto1 I run a node with my 200$ nvne ssd I got off amazon. Why is it so hard for these people to understand.
14,"@HentaiAvenger66 idk if the .eth name makes me a soyboy but here you go: jacksanderson.eth is my name on twitter, feel free to drop me a gift."
15,"I didn't flip permabull on everything, the inflation numbers were worse than expected and I'm willing to bet the FED is aggressive in tappering. Looking to buy back in slowly below 3k, will admit I'm wrong above 3.4k"
16,"Nobody who is left investing in ethereum is willing to sell below 2200$, everyone who was willing sell already sold in either may or 2 weeks ago."
17,@notgrubles what do you mean? I run an ethereum node an my laptop with a 1tb nvme ssd. I can audit my funds whenever I want.
18,I'm this close || to flipping perma-bull on everything.
19,RT @etoeth: Btw for those that don’t know a lick about historical cryptography. Alan Turing killed himself because he was chemically castra…
20,and I'm glad that this person will take a back seat/limited role moving forward.
21,To think a developer who works in the Ethereum ecosystem can continue to hold such opinions and then hide behind their religion as a scapegoat. Not to mention he probably owns and flaunts the gayest crypto-punk pfp out there. This space gets weirder by the day...
22,"This isn't cancelling someone cause they haphazardly dropped the n-bomb, this is refusing to work with someone who thinks the majority of the people in this space are sinful and disgusting. Thanks, for the ENS airdrop and all but christ it kinda feels a bit dirty now."
23,"Regarding what is going on with @BrantlyMillegan , his comments are simply not acceptable. An apology would have sufficed for me, something along the lines of: ""What I said was stupid and wrong, and I'll refrain from further comments moving forward"", but to double down, YIKES!"
24,"RT @iamDCinvestor: here me out on this, but i think the problem is most crypto people are actually socially inept"
25,"Everyone is currently very bullish at price action that is historically remarkably bearish. 

Load the bart candle."
26,This genuinely hits home as so many of my teachers just called me stupid and gave up on me. The way that I could build myself up to studying C.S. at a good university was through people on the internet many of which came from India. https://t.co/98GzERJUYg
27,As time moves on meta looks more and more attractive as an investment.
28,What am I doing? Sitting stablecoin yield farms and catching ez shorts. The best way to outperform is usually the easiest.
29,"One day, hop, optimism, arbitrum, and starkware will do an airdrop and this will be a happy day."
30,"Remember when we all got airdropped 5 figure sums of money for doing nothing. 

Good times."

33,"RT @econoar: The frogs probably aren’t making fun of @TrustlessState anymore for not knowing who Daniele was. 

😂😂😂"
34,"For the longest time people dunked on curve. 

It isn't about who operates best in the good times, it's about who is left operating in the bad."
35,"@TrustlessState @Wonderland_fi @0xSifu @Chase @haydenzadams @Twitter @ARKInvest @RyanSAdams Are we in a bear market? have you checked the prices, ser?"
36,"People are grossly discounting how amazing some of these tech companies are going to start to look if we get another shake out, Currently:
- BABA (13pe)
- FB (21pe)
- msft (32pe)
- aapl (29pe)

Getting these at an average of ~20 would be killer."

41,"Driving around in a corolla as a billionaire is the coolest thing you can do. It's the only way to state: yeah, I absolutely crushed the game and am completeoy apathetic to it. I made enough money to buy your entire bloodline and couldn't care less. https://t.co/F1fVpi3I2R"
42,@gainzxbt nah this is 10/10
43,Observe the eth daily breaking through the 2300$ resistance.
44,We haven't even had a major stablecoin be at risk of losing its peg yet. The bear market is just heating up.
45,"@mtcoiner @OptimusKevTron1 as a matter of preparation, I can recommend cutting it down the belly, gutting them, cleaning the fish, then putting in sliced lemon with rosemary and garlic. Finally, wrap the fish in foil and cook on a bbq. 10/10"
46,"@mtcoiner @OptimusKevTron1 That's awesome, some of the best memories I have with my parents are going fishing with them. Your son is lucky to have such a good father. Those fishes look delicious."
47,"All this calamity that is going on is very typical bear market behaviour, something to do about shrinking capital that puts everyone at everyone else's throats."
48,"Remember when @TrustlessState got clowned on for not knowing who @danielesesta was?

Yeah turns out nobody really knew."
49,@VFuture @RegimeMyths @bjornwilliams24 @its_a_j_a_y @ROGUEWEALTH You skipped the math class were they talked about averages didn't you.
50,"Run towards fortune and leave peace behind.

Welcome to crypto."
51,"@uponly is usually the best signal to noise in this space. That saylor episode was just noise, the non-stop screeching of ""bitcoin is digital real-estate"", ""manhattan is built in bedrock"", ""something to do with the nasdaq being a bitcoin L2?"""
52,RT @CryptoDonAlt: Feel like I'm the only one that gets more bearish the more I listen to Saylor
53,"saylor called binance a layer 3, this man doesn't know what he is talking about."
54,"All at michael sayler does is talk about bitcoin being manhattan. Who cares? Binance is not a new cool L3, this is old hat."
55,RT @econoar: Funny how I’ve been yelled at for calling Solana EOS 2.0 in the past and now they go out and implement EOS style RAM bandwidth…

58,"When it went down the first time it was for problems that were outlined long before it became popular. Every other time it has gone down it has been for the same reasons.

This is ""eth maxi"" hater capitulation. https://t.co/j4WXFB8fJx"
59,"I keep looking for a bounce to open some shorts, this market is just brutal."
60,"@HentaiAvenger66 Unironically, pull a tetranode and start helping people build things that make peoples lives better. This is the way."
61,"Why do people who aren't in crypto normally care about NFT's?

Because people are getting hilariously rich and they aren't."
62,The bear market is rough. https://t.co/IWXsPMzFCh
63,twitter cut @jack off because he didn't want to embrace crypto only bitcoin.

69,Anyone down to buy my 2017 Lisk bags.
70,"All those decentralized stablecoins are all just weird forms of leverage. Dai, mim, ust, you name it all just leverage. This is billions that needs to be unravelled before we bottom."
71,"@TheCryptoCactus Okay so real talk, where we gonna find the money? Everyone who wanted to invest had invested a month or two ago, and debt is gonna be harder to come by. You gotta couple billion in capital you wanna punt?"
72,@cobie We are going to 0
73,"Despite the recent moves on eth, I believe I am still positive on my script breaker nft pfp. I also get the joy of owning it!

The most wholesome trades can be the most profitable."
74,"I am willing to flip back bullish btw, as I recently flipped bearish, but something has to change. We need to find more money to bring this thing higher somehow and everyone has run dry."
75,"You guys don't get it, not everyone is convinced we are in a bear market. I get calls and texts on the daily from people who are eager to jump in right now, it has maybe been this way for a month. These people are the exit liquidity, they are the people who bought the top."

- Bridges (Hop, Synapse)

It's easy to see why I am so bullish."
94,"The defining factor of whether or not #Ethereum will win is whether or not in can scale effectively in layers. The tools being thrown at this problem are:
- Proof-of-Stake
- Sharding
- Optimistic Rollups (Optimism, Arbitrum, Metis)
- ZK Rollups (Starkware, ZKSync)"
