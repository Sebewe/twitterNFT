12,@Rush_XBT @DuckiesCrypto Been watching for a while. Floors are thin. Backstory is great. Art is perfect. One pump (shilled or otherwise) is all that’s needed to blast off this collection. Just would be nice to see it 100% migrated.

72,@AccioCryptos @Ledger @layamathikshara It’s a pretty easy UI fix/upgrade. Shocking they’re not there yet; would expect them to be leading this space. Especially now as users are building habits and forming their base go-to platforms. Ledger should be all over this… getting their app UI and utility to be more sticky
73,@Ledger @layamathikshara … yet I still can’t see my NFTs natively in Ledger Live or see/add all the tokens in my wallet to be viewed within the app
