Fewer people means you can easily focus on your craft. I personally find it hard to shoot, whenever I know that somebody is watching me."

As with any prime tourist destination, you can expect a lot of tourists in major landmarks. As somebody who requires a tripod and a space, this is basically a challenge. Going out early means there are less tourists."
