He offered me any of his #CloneX in exchange for Luzifer. I wouldn‘t trade him for any other Clone, so he picked the wrong target 😈

54,"I will contribute my knowledge in product design and management to build something around this amazing community—around this cool project 🙌🏻

If you want to join, please hit me up with a DM ✉️"
55,"So I may ask you, dear #CloneXfam, what are we going to make out of this huge opportunity we‘ve been given? 

How can we prove that this is not just a pump 📈 and dump 📉?"
56,"The rising floor prices of #CloneX aren‘t just due to @RTFKTstudios hinting on a badass roadmap. There are dozens of crypto projects giving out highly ambitious roadmaps—but this isn‘t enough. 

It‘s the community around a project, that determines the value of it."
57,"Joining the #CloneXfam isn‘t free. It is super expensive at this point. But there is a value flywheel going on, that can hugely benefit everyone in it. 

WE talk about the project, WE create assets for the project, WE make this project and @RTFKTstudios valuable by contributing."
58,"In classic web2 scenarios brands bring value to a community by offering a service or product. But most of them are free, so guess what? You are the product. And the revenue that you create through using their services goes directly to these companies.

But #web3 is different 🔥"
59,"#Web3 enables us to unleash unimagined potential. The communities currently emerging around projects like #CloneX, #Azuki or #BAYC are huge. And they create and drive value.

As a builder in this space, I‘ve recently noticed a major differentiator between web3 and web2 🔍"
60,"In creating the Space Pod, @RTFKTstudios and @JarlanPerez highly encouraged the #CloneXfam to create their own assets and breathe life into this virtual space.

And the community delivered 🔥

—But what comes next? A thread 🧵"
