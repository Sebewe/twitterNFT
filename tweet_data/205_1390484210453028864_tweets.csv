55,"@mmaatt78 @RyanSAdams translation: there will be a crypto SWIFT where the coins can blacklist addresses (USDT already does this for hacks, blocking the transfer function for hacker addresses). The regulators will always have a permissioned system, it just won't be the monopoly for all value."
56,"@mmaatt78 @RyanSAdams That world won't exist. People have a spectrum of trust in government and that transfers to a spectrum of desires when it comes to money (e.g. FDIC insured deposit accounts). We should expect stablecoins that comply with AML (e.g., USDT and USDC) to grow accordingly."

76,"@GeoffAWilliams @edzitron Outlook, Apple Mail, Gmail don't need to create their own messaging system and then have some 3rd party handle interoperating and translation the messages to other systems. They just all share SMTP.

Blockchain enables SMTP for *any* data, including property records."
77,"@GeoffAWilliams @edzitron This is because a network of computers voluntarily participate to run software (e.g., the go-ethereum client) where any arbitrary compatible code can be run and outputs from past code be accessed.

This allows any competitive groups to collaborate where doing so benefits them."
78,"@GeoffAWilliams @edzitron The addresses still rely on DNS though - which is a 3rd party. And the content itself is duplicable (see: chain spam). 

Blockchains enable arbitrarily complex databases to be shared. Instead of DNS where it is IP Address &lt;=&gt; human readable name. It's ANY address &lt;=&gt; data pair."
79,"@GeoffAWilliams @edzitron 4/ SMTP is the backbone of the email system. 

""Most email clients—including Outlook, Apple Mail, Gmail, and Yahoo Mail—rely on SMTP to “push” or send messages from a sender to a recipient."" - postmarkapp

But the scarcity there is email addresses not the email content."
80,"@GeoffAWilliams @edzitron 3/ if competitors can create/ trust a 3rd party for managing shared scarcity then it all works. But this is contentious and rarely credibly neutral (see: any association where big tech is disproportionate funder).

But protocols like HTTP, TCP/IP, SMTP don't have this problem."
81,"@GeoffAWilliams @edzitron 2/ 
Blockchains serve as a shared data layer, but so can computer servers. 

DNS for example was built up after years of individual companies decided to make a non-profit association to handle the IP Address &lt;=&gt; DNS conversion."
82,"@GeoffAWilliams @edzitron 1/
