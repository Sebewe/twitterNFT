16,@ferdousbhai .... Solana would be scaling Ethereum if it became a rollup settling on Ethereum at all times. Good for Solana and good for Ethereum. Solana can focus on secure execution and leave security/data availability to the most decentralized and robust smart contract network on earth.
17,@ferdousbhai Why not just settle at Ethereum all the time?

26,@AliAbunimah @EU_Commission Idk man I think you might be wrong on this. Maybe he's just a desk warrior along with the rest of us but it's hard to watch the Ukrainians responding to the encroachment of their lands so courageously and just simply do nothing. There would seem to be a risk to doing nothing.

50,@nabihbulos Not too sure this is true *other* than in the way it's being reported in the news. There was pretty widespread protest of the war in Iraq from day one. Arguably much bigger than what we are seeing for Ukraine.
51,"@noLE127 Well, then, the beatings will continue."
52,@Stehros @nordic_ned @hasanthehun His popularity has slipped *in spite of* the sanctions rather than because of them? These aren't the first sanctions leveled at Russia but it's mainly been directed at particular elites afaik. I'm familiar with studies showing sanctions don't work but it's still up for debate.
53,@CryptoPunk4052 @BFairclough23 @tedcruz He just said the left hates it. I'm on the left buddy I just want universal healthcare and to take common sense measures to mitigate impact from climate change. This is political BS. TED was a Trump bootlicker. He doesn't care at all about liberty.
54,@Stehros @nordic_ned @hasanthehun A well reasoned perspective. Appreciate it. Ya I think the sanctions against Russia for its actions up to this point have been helpful to erode his popularity there. I think Hasan is wrong that making Russians take some heat for its governments action is bad.
55,@basche42 Hero
56,"@Stehros @nordic_ned @hasanthehun According to public opinion surveys conducted by NGO Levada Center, Putin's approval rating was 60% in July 2020.... he's quite popular. Not saying the opinions will shift much more from 8%. You can assume whatever you want but feel free to offer information as well."
57,@nordic_ned @hasanthehun That's before. Now that he's invaded things have changed. Putin is enormously popular there so I wouldn't be surprised if opinion has shifted.
58,@hasanthehun Why do you think it's not popular in Russia I've seen no polling data?
59,@StefanZweig_EU @mtaibbi It's not weird at all that they don't want to reveal undercover assets

79,@Frances_Coppola @cyber_hokie I remember I bet one of my friends back in college that no state would ever leave the EU :\. I'm overly hopeful. I hate watching institutions that bring nations together begin to crack at the seams. These institutions are so important and people take them for granted.
80,@Frances_Coppola @cyber_hokie It's definitely the perfect test-case for how serious the alliance is if Putin decided to make a move there. I choose to be hopeful that such an important institution still stands. Otherwise....
81,"RT @SBF_FTX: 16) And again, go do something nice for someone.

82,@Frances_Coppola @cyber_hokie less than 1% chance of invasion of Finland but 98% chance of an invasion of Georgia within the next 8 years. Perhaps could be mitigated by a strong response on the part of western powers as a result of this encroachment but I won't hold my breath for it.
83,@cyber_hokie @Frances_Coppola I think all members of the alliance can expect support yes. But maybe i'm delusional!
84,@Frances_Coppola @cyber_hokie Nope I was just under the mistaken impression that Estonia was not actually part of NATO. Appreciate the correction.
85,@cyber_hokie @Frances_Coppola Exactly. So pretty much Georgia and Estonia are doomed unless they are allowed to join NATO.
86,"@cyber_hokie @Frances_Coppola I don't think he wants to start WW3 on every front possible. He wants to expand/maintain his sphere of influence. He misses the former USSR and delusionally wishes to rebuild it. WW3 means the use of Nukes, he knows that. He thinks we won't stand up for Ukraine and he's right."
87,@Le_Frontiersman @twobitidiot What expansion? Ukraine *wanted* to join NATO they were not actually allowed to join NATO. And simply for wanting to join an alliance to protect their territorial integrity they've been invaded.
