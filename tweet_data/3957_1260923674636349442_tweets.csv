78,"@Pancaykes @NotParroxo @3dFrankenPunks You can pike fun at my loss that's fine.  I'll hold my bag and fortunately have made enough good moves that i wont lose sleep over it. BUT you're not gonna sit there with 830eth and the community will just say ""we believe in you and stick to the course"".  You can, but i won't"
79,@Pancaykes @NotParroxo @3dFrankenPunks You're not here for profits? Then you need to reassess your own strategy.  I didn't by any means expect some initial monumental profit as projects take some time but this collapsed from the start because there is NONE of what you are hopeful for or direction
80,"@Pancaykes @NotParroxo @3dFrankenPunks I've sold a BAYC, am a doodles holder from day 1, multiple Azuki's bought n sold etc.  I have a decent idea what im doing.  This was a total rug bro! Day one the metadata was f'd.  But you're right I got taken on this one 💯"
81,"@Pancaykes @NotParroxo @3dFrankenPunks Okay! Remind ourselves in 6 mos to touch base and see where you're at with your ""vault"" theory. And if you've seen a return on your investment here"
82,@Pancaykes @NotParroxo @3dFrankenPunks It is listed on OS! Go look.  All yours for 9ETH
83,"Case and point of what the @3dFrankenPunks project's ""value"" has created.  @CDorsett30 6.5ETH loss, my own and countless others have funded the founders with 4punks, 830ETH and losses like this for their community.  Accountability is everything in this space and need calling out! https://t.co/6orNVkmLWp"
84,"@Pancaykes @NotParroxo @3dFrankenPunks That's all I need to say! These are the losses the project has supplied it's community.... you think people voluntarily like to take a 6+eth loss? Did this person see the ""direction"" you're referring too? https://t.co/XtnkWK1QvD"
85,"@sopheeloftus ETH Denver :1
Sophee : 0"
86,@JackSitt AMEN
87,@fatjoe @doodles LFG! 💯🤘🏼
88,@megbatphoto #ASYOUARE needs to become a campaign
89,@cozywyatt Wow
90,@rhearajj @doodles LFG! 👓
91,"@NotParroxo @Pancaykes @3dFrankenPunks And NOT 1 time did i say ""F this project"" and I also did not bring this up via the AMA yesterday on discord.  For what it's worth i know they also are not happy with letting their community down but they got 830ETH out the deal and accountability in this space is everything"
92,@NotParroxo @Pancaykes @3dFrankenPunks You aren't in my position.  I have a right to be upset with the direction and performance of this project whether i spent 9ETH or .08
93,@NotParroxo @Pancaykes @3dFrankenPunks My voice doesn't need to sway you.  You aren't who i'm focused on. That would be @3dFrankenPunks
94,"@NotParroxo @Pancaykes @3dFrankenPunks Again you can voice your opinion and so can I.  This isnt a contest.  My franken is listed, so i'm doing what is available to me to offload it.  I am also offering the leaders of the project a proposal.  It's for them to consider or not"
95,@NotParroxo @Pancaykes @3dFrankenPunks I'm the 3rd largest holder out of your 6K holders bud.
96,@NotParroxo @Pancaykes @3dFrankenPunks Bro! Did you spend 9ETH on this project?? Unless you did you have zero credibility here.  I paid to be able voice however i feel about this project.  You can too but the weight of your opinion just means a little less to me right now
97,"@Pancaykes @NotParroxo @3dFrankenPunks If you hold a contest with the winner of the community receiving my franken I think that is immensely valuable.  830 ETH in the treasury right? Out of those 4 punks acquired, how much of that are you seeing? I'll wait..."
98,"@Pancaykes @NotParroxo @3dFrankenPunks And it is listed FYI, it's been."
99,"@Pancaykes @NotParroxo @3dFrankenPunks Out of those 50 a number were minted, so for me to spend 9ETH meant i had some projected confidence in the project and that since has diminished starting with the metadata issues.  Doodles bought back their puker for 100ETH.  A giveaway is not about 1 person but a value add"
