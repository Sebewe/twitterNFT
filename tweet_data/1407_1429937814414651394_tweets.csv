14,"First I fell down the DeFi rabbit hole

Then I fell down the NFT rabbit hole

Now I'm doing the same for DAO's and I must say, this is my favorite one yet

I'm so far gone that I'm never coming out 😂 
Web3 is the only reality that makes sense to me now"

25,"@moopidoopi you are absolutely correct. I think the key word point is that they have the resources

that remains the biggest setback when it comes to creatives getting started but with Web3 and the metaverse, that gap is closing quickly especially with innovations like DAOs"
26,"there are 7.7 BILLION people in the world and you expect me to believe the greatest creative minds are consolidated into 5-10 entertainment companies???

the competition just got very, VERY real for them and they’re sweating"
27,"large corporations are scrambling to explore the new frontier

why?

1. they know this is where the most opportunity will be

2. they’re afraid of the capabilities this grants the masses

both are inevitable https://t.co/khyXBmnCI1"

32,"@cyberxtremog glad I can be of help friend!

remember none of this is FA just observations

the NFT market is still relatively new and extremely volatile - it can crash at any moment

play your cards right and don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, we’re in unstable territory imo"
33,"just an observation that many of you probably knew already

take from it what you will 😌💎🙌"
34,"the NFT market trend as ETH pumps and floors inevitably fall seems to prove that the pullback on blue chips is only a fraction of others

like a 5-20% correction vs. 30-70% 
(depending on intensity of the pump)

and ofc bad projects are just 100% purged"
35,"DAOs can be an amazing supplement to Unions

has this been attempted? anything come to mind for anyone?"

72,"CloneX is extremely undervalued

Floor: 15.7

Airdrop floors:
Space Pod - 1.73
MNLTH - 4.4
Loot Pod - 1.14
(Total: 7.53)

In 2 months, @RTFKTstudios has delivered airdrops worth 3x the avg mint price (2.5) and worth half the current floor

And we’re only in Chapter 2?

Bullish 🚀"
73,"@DezBryant @opensea @RTFKTstudios That’s a good cop! Now all you need is a CloneX to complete the set 🌐

95,@GamerInOcean Thank you!! Can’t wait 🤩
96,"@ClaireSilver12 @NFTethics I agree with this. Besides it being dangerous, there are also scenarios in which some creators may have an amazing idea with a great execution plan but if they have no previous background in the space and dox themselves, there’s a very real chance they won’t get taken seriously"
97,"Just a reminder that we’re hosting our first NFTCC Spaces TODAY at 3PM PST 🤩

We will be giving away (1) @Noodles_NFT to a listener who completes ALL the requirements 🍜
