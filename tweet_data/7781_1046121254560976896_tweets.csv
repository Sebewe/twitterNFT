38,There it is. @Worldwide_WEB3 floor just surpassed @TheSandboxGame 🚀 https://t.co/JBEF1e8MAX
39,@digitalgrails Agreed. Curious to see what the market prices it at pre and post reveal.
40,"At the time of writing this, @Worldwide_WEB3 is only 3% listed (303/9508). Only 117 sales until 5ETH floor and 225 sales until 10ETH floor. Volume has been flying the last 72hours. Don't miss it."
41,@digitalgrails Pre-reveal volume will be insane. Could be a great flip opportunity.
42,@skapebored when I tell you I love $WRLD I mean it. I have some ETH ready for after the airdrop 🚀
43,"@Elimy_GM I love both projects, but do you think mfers slow-down and consolidate soon? I've convinced myself to not buy into high volume"
44,If you had 10ETH and wanted to turn that to 50ETH which #NFT's would you be buying right now?
45,@nashtyboy haven't done my research on nuclear or rebel but have heard good things. Was looking at getting a kennel as well. I think they might have good utility coming up as well as be involved in the $APE airdrop.
46,@OxJB_nft @BoredApeYC Did you get any merch from the original drop? I was in such a rush to grab the skateboard that I didn’t realize I couldn’t grab any other merch after confirming the order
47,@nashtyboy What projects if I can ask? Wondering if we hold some of the same. Ironic tho I did that back in October to grab my mutant and it worked out

72,"@CorpMett @jordanaadiel @Blockworks_ No. In this example of Charlie Mungers investment decision, you would have to use the 57y period for all three. Since BTC was created in 2009 and ETH in 2015, you would use a 7y timeline. In that period, Berkshire returned 230%, BTC 169,000%, and ETH 433,000%"
73,@yoosufmuneer @CorpMett I think you both missed the point
