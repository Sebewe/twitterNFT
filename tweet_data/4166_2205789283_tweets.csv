11,"@JohnDanaher @David_Gunkel @SvenNyholm @Joshuak_Smith @JoshGellers 3- Is it possible to measure intelligence in an artificial being, given that it may have possible unrealised but sophisticated cognitive capacities? (eg: situations where it has not been trained on tasks it could be very good at)"
12,"@JohnDanaher @David_Gunkel @SvenNyholm @Joshuak_Smith @JoshGellers 1- Is it possible to measure ‘suffering’ in an artificial being?
