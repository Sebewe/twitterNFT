42,@_ReallyNotReal @Grummz Nope. The NFT standard we are using is four years old. The mainstream adoption happened last year. So most games in development will launch in the next couple of years.
43,@Grummz Because it takes time to build great games as you should know :) NFTs are new. I think we will see great games and mass adoption in the next 2-3 years.
44,"@Grummz Most NFT collectors know this though, it's already priced in. Also, the most expensive NFTs usually comes with utility so the value is in the token not the image specifically. The price correction will definitely happen but most likely in the cheaper projects."

76,@PeteEtchells Yeah I think the problem here is that most critics aren't deeply involved in the space so what they base their opinions on are the echo chamber of uninformed takes amplified by the media. Much like the moral panic around screens :)
77,"@PeteEtchells Not necessarily, even though most will probably be. They can for example be airdropped and used for utility and interoperability. To me the moral panic around NFTs is very similar to free-to-play ten years ago."
78,@PeteEtchells Monetisation mechanisms != NFTs though. This is a flawed generalisation. The game design dictates how they'll be used. I agree that most projects currently have the wrong incentives though.
79,@PeteEtchells Are there any studies that show that esports (external rewards) is bad for wellbeing?
80,"@PeteEtchells I think this is a oversimplification of what NFT games actually are and more I importantly what they will be. Yes there are P2E games that are more about work than enjoyment but NFT implementations done right means added transparency and the ability to trade assets, if you want."
