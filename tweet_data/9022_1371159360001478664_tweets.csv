16,what invsble friends secondary prices boutta look like on launch 🤔
17,Smh still true tho https://t.co/7D4DlRxopq
18,https://t.co/zg91qnxU40
19,@nftlucy1 @thebunnybuddies Because cash grabs simply don’t care. They white list more ppl than items in their collection. I was also whitelisted and couldn’t mint and looking back. Dodged a bullet. Shitty teams don’t succeed in this space.
20,@thebunnybuddies Fucking joke of a project. Cash grab at its finest. .25 mint was a red flag from the start. Was whitelisted and couldn’t even mint due to Shitty contract. https://t.co/Vvmgs8wIrG
21,And then on top of that I’m whitelisted and it sells out… how’s that even possible. Trash ass mfers
22,Those bunny buddies mint was .40 and got talked down to .25 which is still cash grab prices
23,Don’t plan on using my bite for a while tbh. But the cyber kongz batz look the best so that could maybe change….
