14,@NFTethics not sure if he’s even active anymore (I was blocked) but there was a multimillion dollar rug with @nftgambler and a project called “hidden” back in September/October. He shilled project to his discord. Project rugged and sent his wallet hundreds of eth.

17,@JulienHaroun @Citizen__8 Totally agree. Watching S1 citizens make endless threads regurgitating Becker talking points about “crypto gaming” or “building” is just annoying at this point. No fud for the project it’s just become an annoying Echo chamber

34,Big goals this year. Manifested 🚀
35,How haus is not mainstream yet astonishes me. The value being pumped out is insane. Received free takashi murakami flower airdrop this am (2.9 floor). Haus Pets will be free claim this month. MURI WL...and much more. gold standard for rewarding holders.

38,@BearzNFT we here
39,With all of the impostors buzz and $SUPER being confirmed as WL mint requirement. I think anything sub .90 is a fantastic buy in opportunity for a tidy 3x or more in the short term. Longterm super also very bullish

Last but not least somethin wild cookin with @lilsnipebot"
41,also can people please shut the fuck up about @0xApes_NFT . I’m not even fudding the project. I just see people spamming about it nonstop. Like give it a rest for 1 day pls
42,"A roadmap is much different than delivering. However if they do deliver, this is a massive project to watch. I’m predicting a few eth minimum. https://t.co/5sBrwXtHGn"
43,".02 mint to 1.7 eth floor max. 1.1 and flying rn. Hasn’t even been a month and u get Muri WL (1 eth project), haus pets , art airdrop in a few days, not to mention token generation, and artistic works from the likes of banksy in exchange for burning your module. #hausmaxi https://t.co/FPgenUdBk1"
