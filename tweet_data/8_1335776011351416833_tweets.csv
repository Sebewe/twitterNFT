74,"@retroblockchain @reli3fxyz The proceeds from the primary sale ($1M) went directly to the cause.

If you buy it now, you’re buying it on the secondary market, in other words from another person that’s selling it.

The 10% royalty on the sale goes directly to the cause.

Think before posting next time."

92,"I've been doing Twitter Spaces shows 5+ days per week since last summer.

Some people just can't help themselves: they shill every single time they're on stage.

They just can't figure out that they're on a show; that they're making content.  

Make good content. Never shill. 📈"
93,"Twitter Spaces tip:

Don't shill. Ever. 

Why? Because you don't actually benefit from shilling. 

The audience is listening to a show, they're not there to buy the random bullshit a random person is shilling.

You get invited to speak much more if you contribute and never shill."
