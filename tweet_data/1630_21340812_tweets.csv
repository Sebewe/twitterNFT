2,"RT @daopedia: 1 hour until our chat with @DangerWillRobin from @alliancedao &amp; @d_fdao 🙌 

Do you have any questions for Will?"
3,AYYYYYYYYY congrats @__mikareyes for launching this playbook!!!! 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/RWG74y5a7u
4,@nooriefyi ahhahahahah what!!! yes it's me!!
5,"Come make your freelance dreams a reality with 🎒freelance strategy starter pack 🎒. 

It's the last week to apply!! 

Cohort starts next week - https://t.co/JG1exMphTT"
6,"If any of this is resonating with you, I just want to tell you that it’s not crazy for you to want these things 💗 It’s not crazy for wanting to thrive and enjoy your day-to-day without feeling, doing things that fully excites you. 

You simply need to decide to make that happen."
7,"I also have full ownership of my time, without having to cater to unnecessary meetings or time suck simply because of “this is how they do things there.”"
8,"After months of mindset work and research, I finally made the jump and yes, it was hard and it took time, but I wake up every morning feeling excited about my days and possibilities of what I could make happen that day, with people whom I love 💗"
9,"What I realized in my research was that there’s been a lack of knowledge sharing, focused support and camaraderie for folks who are transitioning to freelance, especially for strategists."
10,"But due to fear of stability, money and self-belief, I’ve been pushing it off for the longest time."
11,"Freelancing is a vehicle and opportunity to make a living on our own terms.  I’ve had a desire to go independent for a while - create projects with people I believe in, work with companies I want to contribute to and truly own the time that I have this lifetime."
12,I believe we all deserve to thrive and live in alignment with how we want to live our lives.
13,"The standard of a 9-5 (or rather in some industries, 9-9??) was created to put us in boxes and extract as much productivity as possible to benefit the corporation. It was, at its roots,  designed without considerations of our intersectionalities and desires."
14,"Corporate America is not made for everyone to thrive. The past two years have pushed a lot of us to see the injustices of our systems much more clearly, prompted us to rethink how we live our lives and solidify the impact we want to make in this world. 

🧵"
