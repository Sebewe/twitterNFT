7,@DegenSpartan Lol we tried so hard to make havven a thing on crypto reddit
8,I like the Wassies https://t.co/rrf1Dr2BG9
9,"@ol_smoothie Another interesting thing she does is mention her injuries from the exercise. Injuries are a thing, you need to be careful, particularly when your body is not used to exercise and it's been overexerting itself carrying around excess weight. But u can't just conclude exercise=bad"
10,"@ol_smoothie Lol. My understanding is that diets as defined as ""a short-term dietary change usually involving a reduction in caloric intake"" have significant efficacy questions. But it seems like she is weaponising that point + the complex mental health component in a wholly unhelpful way."
11,Don’t cry because it’s over - smile because it happened. https://t.co/hPQpUvrE90

13,Hey @LoganPaul you should’ve bought this to do a live unboxing https://t.co/ieXzJPKkRQ
14,"@TylerGalpin Yeah I mean I think he's trying to get at that with 27-30, but yeah hugely slippery slope and I think he's trying to say that this is why a defensible ""right to transact"" is important and needs to be protected, because any government has some kind of slippery slope they can use."
15,"@KieranWarwick 100%. The open nature of the tech that makes interoperability possible is what's exciting, but not because of interoperability. The narrative of 'you can wear fortnite skins in counter strike' is a distraction from the actual benefits of ownership."
16,Very very good thread https://t.co/ZyFsJNkBtk
17,"RT @pitdesi: Can't believe I'm seeing this for the first time:
@pmarca was once in an ad for Miller Lite with the late, great Norm Macdonal…"

26,A mind boggling tweet. There are obvious incentives for writers to pitch and write stories that will get a high number of clicks even if they don’t get paid per view. https://t.co/sYC8cIHMKY
27,@DanBrockwell @up_banking I haven’t considered it tbh. Are they crypto friendly?

41,This meme is actually surprisingly good at unpacking the many layers of this complex and ridiculous recent situation in this strange world of Crypto Twitter. https://t.co/ygLPHIc1kq
42,@infamousXBT @BrantlyMillegan @farokh I hadn’t even seen anything from Farokh involving this stuff tbh
43,"@jrhennessy One thing that gets me is when there’s an ‘autoplaying’ video that forms the crux of the story, but you need to scroll past another adjacent (autoplaying) video to get to it"

48,"Hey @Ticketmaster_AU do you intentionally exclude the date/s of the event I'm booking on your final pre-confirmation screen, or is it simply bad product design?"

52,"As @balajis likes to point out, we need to think about the incentives behind the institutions behind the narratives. 5/5"
53,"The claim that BAYC founders are rich and should therefore be held accountable for things they haven't done is interesting but probably BS, and might be fun to debate if it wasn't coming from a company worth $600m with a business model of getting people to click on links. 4/5"
54,"Click-based business models for journalism (i.e. financed by ads) is the modern update of those trashy magazines that lined a checkout register in the supermarket that had literal lies about celebrities on the front cover, hiding behind 'we need to protect our sources.' 3/5"
55,"Too many people hide behind the label of 'journalism' as an inherent moral good. Journalism can obviously be wonderful for the world in many many contexts, but it can also be a force for harm, and the sooner we can get away from click-based business models, the better. 2/5"
56,"I do agree that if the BAYC founders wanted to stay anon, they shouldn't have started a legal entity connected to the brand in their actual names, but I also think it's lame that you can out some people who don't want to be outed due to your business model of getting clicks. 1/5 https://t.co/bEm1WQG2jd"
57,@abetrade @cobie I don’t know whether to hate this guy or respect him for the hustle

70,"@simonsarris Interesting - like someone else in the comments I first heard this w/r/t innovation from Thiel, but hadn’t connected it to the very real dynamic of people feeling it about their own lives too (esp with regard to marriage, kids, etc)"

83,"@the_panday @MattLosquadro @synthetix_io None of those. If you had a look on-chain at what I've bought, which isn't very hard, it's exclusively common names and a single high quality domain in pop.eth. None of what you just shilled have anywhere near the same value."

92,@ol_smoothie Tbf it would be a good idea to reimburse anyone caught up in this and add some UI warnings
93,@EggNamedCregg @jfaz @Tostky @Tostky do you agree it would be better to be able to sell your in-game items for actual money?

96,"@groenbot I like Franzen, but wasn’t he releasing a novel that ‘inhabited female personas’ literally that year?"
97,"@jrhennessy Nah, but I think it’s the most plausible explanation I’ve seen for why so many of them get scammed. That plus just general human stupidity and stinginess"
98,"@jrhennessy Yeah a lot of the folks who minted apes had v little knowledge of blockchain stuff because they were coming straight over to Ethereum from NBA Topshots, which has an easier UX. This means lots of them have like 5 apes and literally 0 other assets or knowledge, so they get stolen"
99,@ol_smoothie I guess it is the perfect format for a big old circle jerk
