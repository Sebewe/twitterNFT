10,@punk6529 @Anonymoux2311 @SuperRare Twitter’s compression makes it really hard to post a high quality animation. It’s really a pain how different it looks!
11,"Gm! Up and working on my next 1/1, can’t wait to show 🙏🏻 Best thing i’ve done in a while ! 👀"
12,"@Rahim_mahtab @shavonnewong_ Yeah sure, my point is (and following Shavonne’s great analogy lol) you won’t ever buy a shoe if you don’t know they even exist. Happened a lot to me from Metakey’s collectors. They reached out to me after i created the ed. 4 and discovered the 1/1 market."
13,"@shavonnewong_ @Rahim_mahtab You’re right.. The problem imo is that most newcomers don’t even KNOW there’s a 1/1 art market, which is a whole different perspective."
14,@0xRVM La única que me quedó! https://t.co/iq3NVmZXzp
15,"@MarkTheHabibi Rn we’re in the middle of a “get rich quick”/“next bayc” phase of newcomers into NFTs, but won’t last long imo, specially after getting rekt so many times. Your project and other great ones will survive and rise stronger after this. No doubts!"

21,@cathsimard_ 👏🏻👏🏻🔥
22,@krybharat Loool 😂
23,"Seems to me that a lot of newcomers to the NFT space don’t even know there’s a 1/1 market, they are just focused on flipping whatever project they found without any research. Definitely needs to be more educational content on that matter 🧐"
24,RT @jakethedegen: support artists

28,"@ZeroFeeYacht Yes sure, i’ve been silently creating my best piece ever this past weeks, still a lot of work to be done… But just feels dumb to tweet about it these days 😅"
29,"@Anonymoux2311 Why not? If someone feels something while watching it, then it’ll be worth it imo"

82,"A year ago in February 2021, i was minting my genesis NFT on FND with the few money i had left. Bought by my friend @CryptoSteveWand 🤝🤍 Still one of my favorites pieces! 
Crazy how things went up from that day for me🤯… Life changing! And we’re just getting started! 🤝 https://t.co/M8DaOxjDf4"
83,"@motionpunk1 I agree with you, imo the hard part is standing out of the crowd, with so many people learning and working in 3D i think that’s the essential point. Which at the same time, includes learning way more than others, apart from having original ideas. You need to know how to execute!"
84,"@RikOostenbroek @mwstandsfor @Loopifyyy Ooh damn didn’t know about this, can’t believe you went through that 🤦🏻‍♂️"

96,"@3seaterr That’s a battle you won’t win my friend haha, no point on discussing with those people🤷🏻‍♂️"
97,@CrazyJsEmporium @Huppings Good point!
98,"@Huppings This is my main problem with those people, they just mention things that are problems everywhere, they can’t argue about NFTs alone because they don’t understand them."
99,@ALCrego_ Agreed! 💯
