5,"@fire_eth Yeah see that’s the thing. I’m not anonymous because I don’t have anything to hide. I’m me, and I don’t want my one experience on this earth to be masked behind some alternate persona. That’s not to say being anonymous is bad at all, i just don’t see the point personally."

14,This dude @JaMorant is not a human being. Most exciting player to watch in the game and he’s just getting started. What he did last night is just INSANE. He represents a new type of talent the likes of which the game has never seen.
