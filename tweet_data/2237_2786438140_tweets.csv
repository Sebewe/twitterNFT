6,Space Doodles are one of the most beautiful and innovative things I’ve seen &amp; heard in this space.
7,"I reckon when it comes to fashion trends, art trends; this is mostly due to the speed &amp; quality of communication, which is Moore’s Law’s sister. 

Where new styles are quickly adopted and assimilated into cultures and trial and error ensues."
8,"Trends seem to compress with time + technology.

Take the NFT collection bias over the last 14 months. 

A style becomes a hit &amp; is quickly duplicated, consistently &amp; repeatedly - then shifts to the next. 

As we move through time, cycle turnover will shorten exponentially."

54,"@xuannu_eth I agree. I also think part of the solution as the creator, is to consider the thought of a stealth launch, rather than hype. Build your project, complete it, then launch socials. Otherwise you face behemoth pressure that can easily extinguish the passions you once had."

61,"@HODLHil @NFTLlama @WeatheReportNFT Yeah, that's exactly the point of art."
62,@HODLHil @NFTLlama @WeatheReportNFT Artists don't need roadmaps. They have art. Projects that shill roadmaps typically aren't made by artists.
63,"@jazzcallner Audiences supporting blue checkmarks, versus audiences supporting an artist. 

Nearly identical art, at a crossroads. 

One is perhaps allegedly about being cool, while the other is allegedly about supporting idealistic virtues. 

I'm at the edge of my seat tbh."
64,"web3 space is the greatest social exercise we have ever witnessed, real-time."
65,@jazzcallner It’s a wild social experiment happening live. Also curious to what we see by mid-year.

67,"If an artist makes a collection and doesn't proclaim a roadmap, stops making art. You didn't get rugged.

You collected their art. Same as their 1/1.

If non-artists hire artists to make a collection, proclaim it as their own and then shut down operations. 

You got rugged."
68,"@SenseiMilli 😂 Nah you good. 

I'm getting more more into the genetic memory gig and there's more &amp; more science every year that backs it up.

The past lives thing, if you were referring to reincarnation or the like, that's something that I'm waaaaay far from taking seriously currently."

75,"@SenseiMilli I mean. I don’t think prodigy is even a real thing tbh. 

It’s a nurture thing, whatever you were exposed to as a kid, is still skill building. Your interest in that skill was nurtured by your peers, family and educators. 

If you’re lucky, someone took notice and encouraged you."

87,"A follow up rule of thumb. Everyone is capable of being an artist or a writer.

Just put in the work. Talent isn't real.

Skill is."
88,"A rule of thumb for making an NFT collection, don't make one unless you're an artist or a writer.

You have the option of creating visual or audible art, or writing an immersive world.

You have no place building a collection if you're neither of the two. Go home."
