56,@V1Islandboy Lol I chuckled at this. 😆 Excited for the news. Will need to buy another 0x because looking to take some profits on the news but want to stay in the community.
57,@who_remains @Kingslyhong @starboisdao Verrrry nice. Red fur + eyes is a great trait combination.
58,@tommytrader_ Bruh mostly yellow is an understatement. 😆
59,"@Fatape9555 @1CON1CETH Hey we have the same trait. Good taste! I love the helmet and joker card, picked it above floor."
60,@Fatape9555 Making money and escaping the rat race is my number one reason for entering NFT's tbh. It's much easier if you're generous and are kind to people. &lt;3
61,"Really grateful for my twitter followers and people I have met so far in #web3. It really feels like you can do whatever you want in this space.

I'm still only a few months in but, really pumped to eventually find people to build with."
62,@yaboiilex @Chameleon_NFT Let's go bro. I think the #Oxcham complements #0xape well. Seems their more utility focused while 0xape is more hype/community. Really bullish for both collections  and think they will only amplify each other.
63,"@dropte_eth @opensea Sup Bro! Whole timeline is a lot of yellow.😆

Might load up on a few quality Solana projects that are capable of surviving a bear market. Bet OS will make them pump. I currently hold @RadRugsNFT ."

73,@gldncrypt0 For sure. Definitely have to sift through people just shilling vs looking to grow in this space. I've begun setting notifications on for the more notable people who put out some good content not just hounding for engagement.
74,"HAHA. One tip for newer people to the space: Always check engagement and twitter followers to make sure their legit. Lotta projects, esp rugs, heavily botted with a fake audience.
