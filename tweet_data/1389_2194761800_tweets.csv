18,@_itsanhonour would only co-write it with you 🤪
19,@DjSterlingC seeee you tmrw!!
20,"12/ Overall, I see an incredible opportunity within the DAO tooling and infrastructure space.  I’m still learning about web3 and would love to connect with others investing &amp; building in this space.🚀Let me know if you have any thoughts / feedback.🙏 https://t.co/1hChg6a1cS"
21,"11/ LEGAL: Unlike corporations, DAOs don’t fit cleanly into existing regulatory frameworks. Tools that help manage legal and tax nuances around 1) member protection from liabilities, 2) tax treatment for DAO-related activities, &amp; 3) compliance are critical for mainstream adoption"
22,"10/ Can we convert on-chain activity into a web3 version of a resume and credentials that can be ported across DAOs? This type of on-chain reputation system will allow members to showcase their contributions, governance voting history, and token holdings to other DAOs they join."
23,"9/ REPUTATION: Traditionally, resumes allow companies to get a glimpse of an individual’s skills &amp; experiences, but that doesn’t exist in web3. There are no accurate tools for determining who to trust and collaborate with, thus difficult to align with members with similar beliefs"
24,"8/ CONTRIBUTION: Currently, 1% of DAO members do 90% of the work. Tools that can turn disengaged members into active contributors will help retain top talent and create meaningful value. How can we distribute responsibilities to members while tracking their progress via KPIs?"
25,"7/ COORDINATION: Are there tools to find and assign specific tasks to members based on their on-chain activity? What are some project management, documentation, and workflow tools that can help web3 organizations stay on track, self-organize, and better coordinate?"
26,"6/ COORDINATION: Symmetrical information is critical for DAOs, but there’s currently no clear way for the latest announcements &amp; priorities to be seamlessly shared with members. DAO coordination at scale is challenging because “work” has historically been driven by hierarchy."
27,"5/ ONBOARDING: After joining a Discord, members are unsure who to connect with and become overwhelmed with the experience. DAO tools that support clear onboarding processes (e.g. apprenticeships, bounties, working groups) and workflows will improve retention and contribution."
28,"4/ ONBOARDING: Most DAOs are doing a sub-par job of getting new members involved, leading to a leaky funnel. In traditional orgs, there are processes for new employees to set up 1-1s with functional peers or be assigned to an onboarding buddy. The same does not exist within DAOs."
29,"3/ And this is why many web2 tools (e.g., Slack, GoogleDocs, Asana) cannot be retrofitted to this new way of self-organization. Even with $9B+ in AUM and $21B total market cap of DAO tokens today, these web3 orgs are still lacking the right tools to coordinate effectively."
30,"2/ There needs to be a shift in how we work together in a hierarchal model to this new decentralized world. As such, DAOs must reverse engineer years of “best practices” from traditional governance and leverage a new tech stack that embodies crypto-native organizational thinking."
31,"DAOs are transforming how organizations invest, govern, collaborate, and participate in this #web3 paradigm. I’ve highlighted a few pain points #DAOs experience today and mapped out areas of opportunity for crypto-native tools and infrastructure to better support DAOs. 👇 https://t.co/x7Up9liCEo"
32,"@multichaindave @CryptoDickbutts honestly, the day @andrewmaxman showed me this song... i may or may not have listened to this 5x."
33,"big news! congrats @hyperspacexyz on the round and the rebrand, and v proud of you @0xTanX !! 🚀 https://t.co/o9nl7K6kXL"
34,"in the web2 world, instagram has traditionally been for personal use while LinkedIn for professional. But are there opportunities for that social networking experience to now come together? For people to broadcast their curations while demonstrating their expertise?"
35,i've been thinking a lot about how consumer social apps will shift in this new web3 paradigm. I found @HeyShif's thread about how CoinbaseNFT is building both a personal and professional social network to be very interesting! https://t.co/nLGotslStQ
36,a great read from @jfschneidr highlighting the different combinations of infrastructure &amp; enablement tools that can potentially power this next generation of digital health companies.

40,@mangup_art Sounds about right… absolutely insane 🙌🏼
41,"a compelling analogy comparing blockchains to cities. @hosseeb describes Ethereum as NYC: the subways suck, everything is expensive, and there's always traffic. Despite its high gas fees &amp; congestion, Ethereum (&amp; NYC) still attracts the top talent, taste-makers, and builders... https://t.co/Nndc9Of3TA"

75,"@jfschneidr @vintweeta love this!! I think there are few earlier stage verticalized / specialized virtual care providers that are top of mind. 

Some @M13Company companies include @FormHealthUS @adynhealth @SporaHealth 

Others include: Expressable, little otter, Elemy, Elektra Health, spring health"
76,"@jfschneidr think these are the big buckets. Potential others include: 

- telehealth vs pure chat/care plans
- providers with a robust library of recommendations / content vs those with just pure appts
- RPM/at-home diagnostics vs self reported / lab diagnostics"
77,new love language unlocked: was excited about this project and shared it with @daveychiang. he proceeded to tell me to check my OS... and sure enough I saw a @truth NFT. he knew i'd come across this proj and minted one for me already.🤗gotta love modern romance in the metaverse❤️‍🔥 https://t.co/aXwdMrPuZ5

82,@scottmroth75 @rebeccagwilt @gregisenberg agreed! Definitely think there’s a huge data play here as patients don’t even have access to all their data right now across providers and patient records.
83,@rebeccagwilt @gregisenberg Agree there could be some very interesting use cases in healthcare as well!! Been seeing some wellness companies use tokens as a method of incentivizing certain healthy behaviors.
