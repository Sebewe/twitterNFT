As a result, the profit ranges are tightened further or may result in outright losses for depositors."
51,"So, why haven’t the caps raised to the next nice round number?

If the liquidity in the oSQTH/ETH Uniswap pool is too low and the size of the rebalances grow bigger, slippage will increase which is then paid for by depositors."
52,"What are the costs incurred to the user using Crab Strategy?

When you deposit or withdraw, you must pay for gas fees which can affect your overall PNL. During rebalances, fees and slippage are paid for by depositors."
53,"The likelihood of transactions reverting before/after a rebalance increases.

To protect depositors, if you’re attempting to deposit or withdraw while the rebalance is occurring, you will be blocked from doing so as to not burn gas on a potential revert!"
54,"(cont.)

If ETH’s price moves more than the strategy earned in funding, the strategy will incur a loss on that day."
55,"Another thing to note, the Crab Strategy performs best when Squeeth implied volatility (IV) is priced too high, or that volatility is expected to be low (not IV)

The strategy may go off its delta-neutrality and start realizing exposure to ETH’s price in either direction."
56,"How can a low funding rate affect profitability?

At a lower funding rate, there will be less funding flowing into the Crab Strategy and results in tighter profit ranges to not incur a loss."
57,"Implied Volatility (IV) is REALLY important!

If there is a massive spike in the IV, it may incur a loss to your position!"
58,"When you enter the crab strategy, you are growing your USD, not ETH! Why’s that?

The Crab tries to keep zero ETH exposure via delta hedging. As a result, the strategy only captures funding."
