1,@gainzinc1 @BYOPills @nftworldsNFT Yeah been honoring for a long time. This is a great classic... I should go back and ask 3 sword how that came out? lol https://t.co/D9U5ZqoLjI
2,@gainzinc1 @BYOPills BYO always have and always will be my number 1 fave project in the space. Never have seen a team like @BYOPills  team until recently I have been extremely impressed with the @nftworldsNFT devs. Top 2 in the space no doubt! Putting all I can to support both.
3,@gainzinc1 @BYOPills Oh I've been fam for a long time! Just want to increase holdings... When I first found BYO I wanted to put everything I could into BYO... I was talked out of it... Instead threw 44 ETH at the ape that coulda gone here. 😥 Should have stuck to my guns and at least hit kingpin stat
4,@carlos_burkart @monsterapeclub Yeah my time so locked up I just haven’t been around as much unfortunately. They are going to need some very very very big news to create any catalyst thi.
5,@carlos_burkart @monsterapeclub Teams the put 110% get that kind of results. I can only hope. But sorry gonfu the fucking 20 million dollar whale who has 9 figures invested in illumium winning the MAYC makes me sick.
6,@carlos_burkart @monsterapeclub Yeah man I have 12. Thought art was incredible. But teams matter most.
7,@carlos_burkart @monsterapeclub Gongfu won? You mean the guy literally connected to their company as an investor. Isn’t that just brilliant.
8,"@carlos_burkart @monsterapeclub I haven’t been in server to see if any changes are underway, but seems to me the community was treated so under valued IMO. A rug pull would of hurt less than that."
9,@carlos_burkart @monsterapeclub It’s the strangest thing I have seen tbh. Literally mods saying this isn’t their full time commitment? I don’t even know what to say to that and only can pray for a rebound at this point.
10,@carlos_burkart @monsterapeclub I’ve never been more unimpressed with a team that made millions over night in my life.
11,I’m still considering a play but need a catalyst to make call. If I had more then 1 ape this woulda been done long ago… but these posts should let you know @BYOPills is going to be one of the most explosive plays in the space when the time is right. I can’t wait for real launch. https://t.co/avf7zWXlaB

68,@Tybie2K @0x_fxnction @yugalabs Yep 💯 I personally do like the view point of looking at new mints as almost like a company IPO to bring them the funding they need to fulfill promises which is what I was getting at. It feel like so much more control then an actual stock share. That said it most def isn’t equity
