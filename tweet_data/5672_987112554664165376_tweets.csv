2,The BOFA days were the best days in this space.
3,@WomanNFT im in a few but dont really go in them anymore. i don't wanna hold anyone back because of my problems. so i'm just doing it alone like when i first started. eventually my account will die completely. i know i'll never make it here. and im ok with that. im happy for everyone else.
4,@WomanNFT eventually everyone just stopped talking to me. good reason i guess. every tweet i make i lose followers. I took a long break and now no one knows i exist again. it's like i just joined the space again. i spent all last year to get where i am at. now it's going backwards lmao.
5,@WomanNFT I have a strong feeling ill be seeing alot of dicks on my feed now soon 🤣
6,Started to do my sketchy style art again and boy oh boy have I missed it. New piece up soon 😊
