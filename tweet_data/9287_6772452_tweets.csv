And while I disagree with the original concept of ""clubhouses"", I also disagree that web3 is only distributed, and doesn't need centres (if only temporary) or retreats.

I think there needs to be a balance."
2,"@nico_eth I hear you, and I certainly agree that the tech underpinning web3 doesn't need centres.

But don't absolutely rule out our needs as humans to be social.
