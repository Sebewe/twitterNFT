36,@AlmightyRover If you want better schools you pay more taxes. Not everyone has children or school age children to care. More people don't vote than do vote on budgets.
37,@AlmightyRover Teachers salary should be determined by the budget of the town/city. If the population around the school cant afford high taxes to pay the teacher what they want or expect the teacher needs to move. Teacher in RI are getting about 55k but in my town the avg is 80k. Taxes taxes...
