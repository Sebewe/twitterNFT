25,@niron @filos Idk yet
26,@niron @filos Of course not :) Mories is a huge culture in the NFT space. Team is working incredibly hard. It was a DMCA takedown - legal procedures that are being taken care of.
27,"It might be a good opportunity for @LooksRareNFT to feature @CryptoMories. Given the size of the community, the culture it created, and the surrounding supporting projects - it could be an excellent opportunity for both."

46,@itstylersays I saw ETH price go up in my dream lol
47,@danielgothits Up only
48,"@Chadudubirimedu It’s a “feature” in a way. For a “normal” collection owners need to pay a gas fee the first time they list the item. Some collections decided to give the sale permission to OpenSea by default to save gas. While this does save gas, it takes away some rights of the owner."
49,@Chadudubirimedu Depends on how they made the contract
50,@flywheelfund This does not seem to be the problem (given that this is the one that OS provided you to sign when listing an item).
51,@danielgothits I like leaving politics out of my twitter. But I still appreciate a fire joke haha
52,"@danielgothits Idk how aligned our political views are, but this joke is hilarious 😂"
53,"Being an extremely well-executing team, @psychedelic_nft has left a method in the contract to give owners back their full permissions. I think it’s time to call this function @BAYC2745 https://t.co/2fz7hqz4IZ"
54,Non-technical explanation - I am talking about projects which have gasless listings (do not require you to pay gas for the first listing). This essentially means the service has allowance on your tokens and you have no way to revoke it.
55,"After seeing so many exploits of centralized marketplaces, I believe projects with default approved proxies for them should revoke the access (if possible). Only the owner of the NFT should decide who has approval on their tokens. Looking at you @psychedelic_nft."
56,The biggest problem of @LooksRareNFT is that listing items costs gas - barrier to entry is high. That's why the @the_x2y2 only lets you claim after you list NFTs from multiple collections. $LOOKS like they are figuring it out one strategy at a time. https://t.co/7g8fbT2hyC
