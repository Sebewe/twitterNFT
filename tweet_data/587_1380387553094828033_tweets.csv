75,"@the_freightrain @Coinbase_NFT How many “normies” do you know that buy crypto and just leave it on Coinbase? How many actually self-custody with their own wallet?

The first option isn’t available for NFTs. When it is, I think that changes things dramatically."
76,"@the_freightrain @Coinbase_NFT Custodial wallets on @Coinbase_NFT will be key. 

Tons of people are somewhat interested in NFTs but completely crypto illiterate. The whole process of setting up a wallet, funding it with ETH, and making a transaction is too much."

I got into fantasy football around the same age and that replaced from yugioh. I can consistently profit, but I’ve always played to win."
84,"@wagmi_energy But now the ama part:

What was your favorite card? Mine was a shiny mirror force I got in one of my very first packs. https://t.co/21Dzwg0wQw"
85,"@wagmi_energy I would buy and sell cards on eBay (as a 10-12 year old), so I knew all values.

I went to a weekly meetup, rekt other kids in trades, and flipped them on eBay.

I also placed top 50% in a regional tournament. 30 year old dudes were soooooooooooo mad when a 12 year old beat them."
