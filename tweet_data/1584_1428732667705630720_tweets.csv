78,"@sourcex44 @andreas @Immutable @0xPolygon @solana @SkyweaverGame @PolymarketHQ @aavegotchi @zed_run @YGGIndia I like Polygon for small DeFi trade but compared to Immutable I’m not sure it’s suited for high game items transactions, but def a good alternative"

81,@0xnello @doodles Welcome to the fam! 🌈
82,@andreas @Immutable @0xPolygon @solana @andreas this could be huge if it gets traction https://t.co/fJjMFQ6sSc
83,"@andreas @Immutable @0xPolygon @solana The reason I like @Immutable is that it’s design for gaming and Game Stop will launch a market place on top of it, it is also inheriting from Ethereum L1 security, I think Solana have too much downtime and 0xPolygon might not be design for high volume game trading like Immutable"
