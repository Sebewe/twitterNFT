25,"@jonaslamis @AlbertoRizzoETH @QuantumNFT @amyelkinsphoto Agree, I wouldn’t be able to answer! They’re all special in different ways. Anxious Pleasures has such an interesting story behind it"
26,@WimVanCappellen @AlbertoRizzoETH @QuantumNFT Yes! This series is delightful. I believe that some of the limited edition IRL prints are owned by collectors such as @ReeseW &amp; @eltonofficial
27,"@lifeofc @QuantumNFT @joeyldotcom @kgpnyc It has an important meaning behind it too. @kgpnyc shared that the scene is rarely found in contemporary photography in the US, an Asian father and son who are often discriminated against."
28,@lifeofc @QuantumNFT @joeyldotcom Yes!
29,"@raven50mm @QuantumNFT @Snapshotlopes @_xst First off congrats on the sales! Second such a nice pick up, both are awesome collections @Snapshotlopes @_xst"
