68,@VoyageTwins I couldve used that before my purchase good Sir
69,@ivmitrovic @FameToClaim I thought the marketing was fairly good. The sneak peaks were also cool looking but not what was actually delivered. In the end I just made a poor decision driven by FOMO on making a nice flip or ending up in a cool project
