3,"@ashcooperkerns @ElleToussi @imyjimmy i laughed so hard when i first saw that clip. still a great re-watch. “I am here live, I am not a cat.”"
4,"@artmetaverse yes, and awe-inspiring in its ability to stretch reality."
5,"@r0bp inspirational cats are hypoallergenic, at least most of the time. but i hear you."

12,inspiration is a cat.
13,@GabrielJWeis JOMO - joy of missing out.
14,@metastash happy memories for sure. reunion soon?
15,"@MuseumOfQueer there are already a few long-running ones, but never hurts to have more poetry around. so lmk when and where."
16,"@NftLandy @MuseumOfQueer @AaronHaber thank you, Landy!"
17,"@CharredJawa @Pat_Dimitri @AaronHaber @boredgentleman @NFT_ish @WeinbagZ same. not a complete discord fast, but definitely cut the discord carbs down to a minimum. feel healthier for it..."
18,offlications rule.
19,RT @AaronHaber: We’re live + talking about wen to take profits! You need to get in here now! @boredgentleman @shakenbakespear @Pat_Dimitri…
20,that certainly was a very special collab. https://t.co/ecUXdp7acR
21,"@henrikfriberg not a big fan of shameless tagging, especially without prior contact, but i do have a soft spot for poetry. i am basically an entire soft spot for poetry. what was the process between the original slam and the ai part?"
22,@TheArtMarketHub @CaballeroAnaMa @Artemis_Wylde @rebellicca @in_cloudlands @thestorydj @sashastiles @NivPoet @MargaretLabour @LaurenceFuller your joy and belief in visual poetry is palpable and made my day significantly better. thank you!

24,"@CaballeroAnaMa @TheArtMarketHub @Artemis_Wylde @rebellicca @in_cloudlands @thestorydj @sashastiles @NivPoet @MargaretLabour @LaurenceFuller what wonderful news to return to, after a short offlication. thank you so much @CaballeroAnaMa for including my collab with @phenmas in your curated list, and alongside so many poets whom I admire."
25,@Eyeabovesky @EnchantedNFTs @chussain i look forward to exploring this magical realm. and kudos again: the pfp previews i have seen are amazing.
26,"@_bassen_ as for me: i do and i don’t. my mind has never been especially peaceful, is always buzzing, regardless of my follower numbers. generally pretty laid back though and def not that obsessed with who or how many follow me 🤷‍♀️."
27,@_bassen_ you asked for wrong answers 🤣. i do not think that having a lot of followers brings you peace of mind. quite the opposite usually.
28,@vizmesh @EnchantedNFTs @chussain @Eyeabovesky thank you!
29,"got myself an @EnchantedNFTs artefact! after more than a year in nfts, i am bullish on people that have consistently shown up and followed through. so any project of @chussain's is going to have my attention. plus the art by @Eyeabovesky is beautiful. 💙 https://t.co/Ny7Uorl5Mh"
