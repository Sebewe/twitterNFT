Every time I switch weapons during a reload, when I come back to the secondary weapon, it continues the reload.

This is the worst thing in #apex outside of the audio.

8,"@NFTBeliever @HarlanEth @0x_fxnction @MAYCBoshi @LooksRareNFT I don’t believe the 2% fee on each transaction is getting cut down to 1%..

WETH rewards are simply the 2% trading fees for the platform, being distributed proportionately to stakers.

I don’t see anything that says the platform will drop trading fees to 1%, at any point."
9,"@NFTBeliever @HarlanEth @0x_fxnction @MAYCBoshi @LooksRareNFT WETH does not get cut in half….
Why do people keep saying that?

Only $LOOKS rewards are cut in half, as there is a finite supply of LOOKS and they need to taper it off over 2 years, until it’s all disbursed.

WETH rewards are not changing. It’s the trading fees paid to stakers."
