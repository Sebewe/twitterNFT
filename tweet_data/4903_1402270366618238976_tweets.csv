26,"@azfnft Maybe, but they could also lose a lot of market mindshare for a long time if the ape token comes out between now and those 36 days and utility/tokenomics is far better.  Let's watch and see and learn :)"
27,"Also, I need to point out - I hate this meta game. It means the launchers did something wrong. It's not a real game. Let's build a P2E with a game and utility at the root, not the meta game. Can it be done?"
28,"In a lot of P2E's it seems the actual game upon launch is the ""meta game"" of selling at the right point.  My thesis is ~72 hours in is when you want to sell what you have.  $MILK launched recently, I'll come back to this in a week and see how we hypothetically did here."
29,"@azfnft Great breakdown as always! The answer is most likely ""no"" based on what you laid out. 36 days is so incredibly fast for there to be no publicly announced utility after that date. Quite shocking tbh."

53,@MetaverseKing3 No reason we can’t have a truly open decentralized 0% fee marketplace by that point. Instead marketplace will incentivize buying with their optional  token which will be the equivalent of the 2/2.5% fee we pay today.

68,I look forward to continuing to build with @Immutable and make great things together and hope the rest of their partners will as well 🍻🥳🤓
69,The actions of GameStop are honestly embarrassing for that company. For GameStop to be trying to enter web3 and NFTs they have shown they have lots to learn about partnership and shared growth.
70,Shout out to @Immutable ! I’ve been building on their platform since day 1 and it is world class tech with a great team - both technically and just good people. Very bullish on IMX and how they’ll innovate on layer 2 powered by @StarkWareLtd . https://t.co/BNomBS2hSu
71,"@MagicalBeaker @wietse111 @hankgreen Tooling will improve over time. You know you don’t have to use NFTs too. But just because you don’t use/get it, doesn’t mean you need to negate all you hear. That’s not discourse. So good luck with the things you do like."
72,"@MagicalBeaker @wietse111 @hankgreen There’s so much else you can do with packaging up applications inside it as well. It’s literally just data and you can assign it. It’s as dumb as a public database, but the beauty is it’s public no matter how simple it is. And cryptography let’s you prove ownership unequivocally"
73,@MagicalBeaker @wietse111 @hankgreen At this point you’re not trying to learn. The most common example of NFTs is proving that you belong to a community. That piece of data is provable ownership. You can’t access token gated things without it. It’s the de facto example
74,"@MagicalBeaker @wietse111 @hankgreen Publicly provable ownership of data from anyone in the world at any time instantly. Data, not images. Provable ownership through cryptography on a public ledger on a wide scale. This is powerful, and it's not seen (or widely seen) in many environments today. Nfts make it easy."
75,@MagicalBeaker @wietse111 @hankgreen It’s very much your opinion which you are stating as fact. You need to realize that. The alternative is you are the foremost expert on NFTs and have dismissed them as adding no unique value.
76,@MagicalBeaker @wietse111 @hankgreen That’s good Mr Beaks. Enjoy your hobbies
77,@MagicalBeaker @wietse111 @hankgreen I guess so from a pure utility perspective. There’s a whole world of open data protocols and public and interoperable capabilities too. It’s pretty cool too
78,@NoahBrand1 @hankgreen For “so do we” - it’s not a war or a competition. I’d hope my opinion could change more over time to be like yours and I’d hope the same of you. There aren’t battle lines drawn here
79,@NoahBrand1 @hankgreen NFTs at their root are public and open access to data with probably assigned and immutable ownership. This is extremely powerful in the long term and vastly different than private tech products of today. Let’s see how that plays out.
80,"@jlgribbleart Environmental improvements are coming &amp; drastically coming. And is it worth it, I guess lets see how it plays out. If you look beyond the jpgs, there is a new paradigm of open &amp; public data ownership which doesn’t exist in todays silod web products. Thats what excites me most tbh"
81,@jlgribbleart I think what you’re saying is that NFTs communities are a hobby but they don’t have to be your hobby. I agree with you.
82,"@wietse111 @hankgreen That’s fair, many do that. Look at Dino monks for one about mental health, knights of degen for sports or Illuminati for puzzles as some that break the mold and are about community not mooning at all costs. It’s like anything - there is good and there is bad out there"
83,"@jlgribbleart I’m trying to keep a friendly tone here, it doesn’t feel reciprocated at this point. NFTs have different price points. It’s not a country club for all of them, but yes some have very high points now. Many start very reasonable"
84,"@jlgribbleart Knights of degen has events for each major sport event, discord chats with world famous athletes. IRL events with said athletes, tv personalities, and fellow knights who are in the community. It’s a club both digital and IRL with these communities"
85,"@jlgribbleart Ok gotcha. NFTs have provable ownership, so the community can offer “things” to proven members. Lots on discord which is a combo of chat and events, some in nascent metaverse, and many IRL too. Also like a club people just meet up too"
86,"@jlgribbleart Ny times, wall st journal, Spotify premium…"
87,"@jlgribbleart That’s called paid admission to an event: sports, concerts, video games, college, amusement parks…"
88,"@jlgribbleart Yeah you don’t have to pay for all the free things they give. But like my ticket analogy and your analogy with radio. If you want to pay to go to the concert, then pay. Same thing with NFTs, do the paid version or not. See the concert or listen to the radio"
89,@jlgribbleart It’s not just the image (it also doesn’t have to be an image). Communities have open and free events for all too. You can also see the image without paying just like your radio analogy. I kind of feel like you just described NFTs in your retort against
90,"@wietse111 @hankgreen It’s been nice chatting, thanks for being open. Nice meeting you!"
91,"@wietse111 @hankgreen Look at layer 2 ethereum and immutable X which are either free or very minimal. Look at NFTs on Solana where tx costs are negligible or polygon. That problem of eth L1 will go away. Also not everyone buys them to flip. Flipping culture exists everywhere, NFTs not immune"
92,@jlgribbleart Idk what you’re trying to say. Most communities are very welcoming and many don’t require the nft to be apart. Some have gated access to having the nft which is how most of the world works anyways. Can’t attend a t swift concert without a ticket…
93,"@wietse111 @hankgreen Given some of your arguments and statements I’d encourage you to research about some communities and learn more first hand on good and bad nft collections do and what access you can or can’t get. It’s more than monkey pictures, it’s not really about the pictures tbh."
94,@wietse111 @hankgreen NFTs are a way of having provable ownership and a way to easily transfer or sell that ownership and it’s extremely efficient. Second saying the events are underwhelming is the same as saying “well I like adidas not Nike”. Don’t buy the one you don’t like…
95,"@wietse111 @hankgreen And like your Nike example too, the shoes are worth 1% material cost of the actual sales cost but they provide more than just what the cost of goods are. That’s how you should look at NFTs. It’s not just the art, it’s community and access in addition"
96,@wietse111 @hankgreen Knights of degen has IRL events as well as digital events where you interact with famous athletes as well as other folks interested in your niche - in this case the niche is sports
97,"@wietse111 @hankgreen The value of the paper of a season ticket that costs $7k to the Yankees by cost of the art and the printing is maybe $100, but they are valued way higher because you get access. Many NFTs give you access to a community. The ape one has had many events for free as one example."
98,@wietse111 @hankgreen NFTs are like any product ever. Some have more utility than others. Some more value. Some come with access (like season tickets in the “real world”). Some are stupid. Some aren’t. There is no difference to what you’re trying to say.
99,"@wietse111 @hankgreen It’s not any different with nfts. More are created. They give you access to different things. Some are audio, video, media and data. Can be enjoyed and shared in a variety of ways. Digital goods are also in the “real world”"
