6,"I've written a simple guide that explains the step-by-step method to turn any written piece of work into a monetisable NFT.

But there is a way for you to mint an article, essay, book or other written work as an NFT."
8,"Usually, they have several low paying gigs which means the quality of the work they do suffers.

This is what Web3 - and the idea of creators having a method to monetise their creations - aims to solve."
9,"These people often don't have a product to sell beyond the writing itself.

Their skillset is not in optimising funnels and sales copy, but in research and creation.

And so they have to take low-paying gigs."

But what about the other people who are doing super valuable work?"

As your service grows, you productise and sell it at scale.

And just like that, you have a profitable business. 

Here's my major problem with this.

This approach is very sales and business-focused."
13,"There's a common way to generate income as a new entrepreneur. The simple (often oversimplified) method is...

- Choose a segment
- Find a common problem
- Write about a solution to that problem
- Sell the solution as a service to the ideal market that engages with your writing"
