57,@0xIntensity Haha already did https://t.co/zB2lGjsXNd
58,@downbigyall @InvsbleFriends Already ran them. They’re very close to moderate … around 30% fake accounts … could signify “buying followers early on” but their most recent engagement makes it difficult to know …
59,Would you guys buy my baby pics? Or are we done with that phase? What about feet pics? When “ApeFather feet DAO” … I’m trynna buy a new TV thanks …
60,@CapetainTrippy Low sub 7%
61,"@CapetainTrippy Everyone has fake followers even if you haven’t bought them. The software can only find inactive, bots, propaganda, or dead accounts … so it’s groups them all into “fake followers” … I’ll run it"

63,@royalty568 So do you https://t.co/Ac1k6ss1Ax
64,Haven’t found any “notably bought accounts” the problem is that most buy 10-20k and then grow organically from there … this partially covers their trail … these people usually land in the “moderate range” … anything higher is just super obvious
65,@czbonick 9.8% normal
