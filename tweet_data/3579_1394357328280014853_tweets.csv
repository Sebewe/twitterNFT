1,@pixjit14 @SmolBrainsNFT @jpatten__ Loving it!
2,It's amazing to have @pixjit14 re-enact the little animation I did. We definitely need to have a place in smolverse to showcase these fantastic community contributions. Made my day! https://t.co/Uf5Ski2G3t

It's all about intentions. Assuming these are good: building at break-neck speed means breaking shit. People should accustom for it as part of their risk assessment. As long as we allow ourselves to learn from failures, we're golden."
