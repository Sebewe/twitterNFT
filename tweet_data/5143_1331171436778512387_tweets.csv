1,@ethlizards @drclarencedavis Who in gods name is actually selling lizards? You gift them that is all
2,"@0xfanfaron Precisely. We consider every new community member early to this movement and, therefore, we treat them equally."
3,@ThiagoXVIII Early birds that understand the lower the barrier to entry the more $. Big 🧠
4,@cagyjan1 Bye-bye beta spot
5,@masterball98 I can totally see why you think it would take that long to build a good game.
6,@BicycleBrides Build a good product
7,@R_Molotovsky I mean I guess you could say it ended up being a bonus but it’s sole purpose was to establish governance not issue monetary value to people. I take your point but you’re somewhat reaching here :p
8,@R_Molotovsky We airdropped pre-ILV (our governance token) so we could establish a council. That drop has zero bearing on how fair the launch of the game will be. It did however end up making our tokenomics much fairer with the blocking of VCs from staking 🤷‍♂️
9,@ThomasMeyerHere I’ve played a few games 😊
10,@R_Molotovsky Huh?
11,@ThomasMeyerHere Set 6.5 is fucked! I’m planning on writing an IP today to upload to governance. Oh wait..
12,@ArcaChemist 👀👀
13,"Illuvium will define what is considered fair launch in game-fi. 

- No whitelists 
- No early-bonuses 
- 0 playable NFTs sold or given away pre launch

Illuvium Zero - land sale 
- No whitelists 
- No special treatment for guilds 
- Dutch Auction 

We will always make it fair"

36,@barrybutterhand @ethlizards Love it but where is the hashtag!
37,@aloka_kam @cryptostanley1 This is getting fairly entertaining.
38,@Proximity_ILV Wow. Even more impressive. Do you even sleep?
39,"@Illuviumnaut Send me your wallet so I can Lizard you! You've supported us enough, time to give back"
40,@Proximity_ILV The lizard was meant to stop this from happening! Turn your bot off :P
41,"6) Suppose we make fully-decentralised games with assets owned by the token holders—that are more fun to play than their mainstream competitors. Plus, we give them the ability to earn. Would 3b gamers decline the invite to this space?"
42,5) We need to focus on critical things the mainstream can't replicate unless they move into our space—such as ownership over your assets.
43,"4) We know, as crypto natives, that this revolution has already begun… But to a newcomer, imagine seeing a sign ""Play-2-Earn"". Their immediate reaction would probably be “This is too good to be true.”"
44,"3) Same thing with P2E and particularly in-game yield; while it is incredible, and I think it gives us the ability to onboard an entirely new subset of the population, it can not and should not be the entire reason someone is playing a video game."
45,"2) While technically possible, interoperability across the Metaverse is insanely complex and requires extreme collaboration between projects. The starting point is assets are interoperable within the same ecosystem."
46,1) Why we need to stop pushing the narrative of Interoperable Assets. A thread 🧵
47,"@aloka_kam @cryptostanley1 Implying that my wealth didn’t come from trading and that I have no input in Illuvium are misinformed conjectures.

This misinformation serves zero basis as evidence that my insights and opinions lack merit. This is just ad hominem.

Alertness and immunity do improve trading."
48,"@aloka_kam @nftlookout Also why are you even here if you think crypto “trading” is gambling… 

But tbh, you’ve already won. I’ve wasted 15 mins I’m never getting back."
49,"@aloka_kam @nftlookout I meant it in the context of gaining my attention. Typically if you had followers a tweet wld gain traction, making me more likely to see it and engage. Another way is to comment something out of context, with misleading facts, to trigger the person who normally wouldn’t engage."
50,@aloka_kam @nftlookout Apologies for assuming your gender btw
51,"@aloka_kam @nftlookout I meant it in the context of trying to garner attention. You post something jarring and it generally does it’s job. Maybe that wasn’t the intention here and there were generally good ones, either way, I think you need to get over me talking about shower habits."
52,"@aloka_kam @nftlookout Mate we’ve got a team of 200 experts building the game. Watch an AMA once in a while, all I do is praise my team and brothers. I’m sorry I triggered you by a little facetious tweet, but you should probably get over it and live your life."
53,"@aloka_kam @nftlookout It’s pretty genius what he’s doing. See he has no followers. So triggering me by saying I had nothing to do with illuvium even though it was my idea is pretty brilliant. That would piss anyone off. But maybe you’re right, maybe this all magically came together and I had no input"

56,@Fight4Ethereum @VolkinGames No chance he gets that info out of me. I'm crazy - but not that crazy.
57,"If you have an extra Lizard, consider giving it a new home. This one is going to someone who will appreciate it incredibly. 

#rehomeurlizard"
58,"My journey with the lizard people started inside the Degen chat of Illuvium, a chat that was inspired by the much-hailed SNX degen chat. I'm hoping to start a movement to distribute our beautiful lizards further and help someone in need. This was also how I received my first Liz. https://t.co/lUawcGqycT"
59,"@MilosVo @_mrfancyy @Fancybirdsio Yeah, they forked Merit Circles contract which excluded the vulnerability."
60,@biblicalviolenc Not when the emissions outweigh the discount.
61,So who is seeding the sFNC/ETH pool? 👀👀
62,"@B_J I prefer fundamentals, but with $ETH, everyone knows they are there. So you have to use TA for short-term trades."

65,@cagyjan1 This could be the largest value bet in youtube history 🤣
66,"@cagyjan1 Not quite; I'm saying if I can't come up with 20 reasons, then I don't deserve to own $ILV"
67,@cagyjan1 If I can't come up with 20 reasons then you can take all my $ILV
68,@cagyjan1 We should do a video together on why you should be going all in on $ILV
69,@cagyjan1 Lol. Did you just read the IZ game doc 🤣 fuck you think the land is for?
70,"One of the ways the Illuvium DAO brings additional value into the system. Purely cosmetic, no damage to the balance or economy, just an in-game flex. 

- win exclusive 1/1 accessories through tournaments and achievements. 

- Each set only available for a limited time. 

Soon. https://t.co/oGsfPLPBy6"
71,@napgener Let's see what happens. I've been trading this guy since $6; id hope I've learnt something.

$1.2m in liquid trading profits. 
Which one made me wealthy?"
74,"RT @cryptoallstar: @KieranWarwick Can confirm, my hot water system broke and I was too poor to fix I so had cold showers for a year. I got…"
75,"Swap your hot showers for cold showers, and you'll become a much better trader."
76,"@f_kinderman @K1TSUNE20 Mind you, it's certainly possible for different games within their ecosystem. I.e. you will be able to play with Illuvials in many other games down the track. But we control the assets that are being created. Without that, it becomes super complicated. I'll write a thread later"
77,"@f_kinderman @K1TSUNE20 Frankly, it's bullshit. We’re so far from it. It's just another buzzword people use in the space to attract people. IMO we need to move away from using interoperable assets as a feature of blockchain until it's at least possible and start focusing on the ownership of assets."

80,"@astroschlag @_mrfancyy @santiagoroel They are positioned to build the largest casual mobile gaming studio in the P2E space. And they have a bunch of advisors to walk them through the crypto elements. It was lucky we got them integrated prior to launch, now you need to trust the builders."
81,"@astroschlag @_mrfancyy @santiagoroel You’re right, I don’t have the time to play an active roll in the discord so I do miss the little things. But you have to remember these guys were literally days away from launching without any DeFi elements and they managed now to raise $13m plus, governance, staking and others"
82,"We’ve got Fortnite raking in 50m on a single skin set, and yet we don’t have a single game worthy of in-game cosmetics on blockchain? Where you actually have ownership over them?These are the signs that tell me we are beyond early."
83,"I don’t know who this person is or where they came from but if you just started investing in crypto, read this thread. You will save a lot of money. https://t.co/1VFVswUtzW"

93,"@AxieAur @AxieInfinity Astute observation, and fully agree, a massive advantage over the rest of us."
94,RT @santiagoroel: The single most important quality one can have is intellectual curiosity.
95,I didn't think there was a chance in hell that Aaron could convince me on anything other than a MOBA expansion of Illuvium next. But he may have just pitched me one of the greatest ideas for a P2E game I've ever heard. It's gonna be a long 10 years
96,@fraggy_eth @VonNeumannILV @ethlizards @illuviumio It's because you made his lizard the best. I demand a redraw
97,@santiagoroel Your risk tolerance is insanely high though 😉
