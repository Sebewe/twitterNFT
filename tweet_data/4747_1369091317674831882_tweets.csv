3,"I've asked this a few times and have gotten some great suggestions:

What are some good NFT projects that have both 1) Commercial IP rights to the owner, and 2) the NFT is a picture of the character's whole body? #NFTs https://t.co/ft1A0gKs5k"
4,@CapetainTrippy GM to you too!
5,@Zeneca_33 Excited about life. Everyday. Honestly. 💡

11,"There is so much propaganda/fake news being spread. Please double and triple check sources. 

This can be a great practice for all aspects of our life too. Looking to buy an NFT? Be vigilant. Moving to a new house/apt? Be vigilant. Picking a longterm mate? Be friggin vigilant!"
12,"I feel we’ve gotten so jaded by the abundant amounts of information at our fingertips that we believe almost everything we see, nowadays.

That’s why I’d like to remind people to be vigilant when reading and sharing any information on the internet. 

More important now than ever!"

Anyone down in the Orlando area?"
52,"We got off to a late start so we’re behind right now. But we’re coming in hot.

I would appreciate it so much if you could vote for @jrich23’s - reverse through the legs dunk, the @KongcreteJungle choice to win the #DUNKKONGTEST @RumbleKongs.

If you can’t vote, RT! 😁 https://t.co/AqyoOVubFM"
