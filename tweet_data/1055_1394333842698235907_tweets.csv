24,"10/ The hype will fade, and only the legit projects will continue to build with or without the hype. 

We can't make all the right plays but if we try to be more intentional with our buys/sells, it just might make our experience a lot more pleasant (:"
25,"9/ Does the buyer really value it in terms of appreciation for the art/project/community etc? Or does he see an opportunity to sell for yet another higher price?

If most of the holders belong in the latter category, it may not bode well for the project in the long run."
26,"8/ Most people buy an NFT at X price thinking that there will be someone else who's willing to pay higher than X.

And that's fair, but I think the real question to ponder is why someone is willing to pay more than X."
27,"7/ If it's a hype or short-term play, how do I take profit or minimise my risk? If the project didn't take off as expected, what did not go well, how could the project do better, or what should I look out for in similar projects? 
I ask these questions all the time."
28,"6/ Of course, like everyone else, I've a lot of other misses – losses on my buys and missed opportunities that would have gotten me a good payday. 

But each of them is a learning opportunity towards making my next buy/sell."
29,5/ The thing about buying into such projects is that I'll probably end up HODLing whether the price is shyt or it moons. It's definitely not for those looking for short-term flips.
30,"4/ Most recently, I got into @meta_angels knowing how strong the team is, the vision of connecting and lifting people IRL, and also their innovative use of ""NFT lending"" built into their smart contract.
https://t.co/E0NR5yEslF"
31,"3/ Then there's @CuriousAddys. Ben and Mai are super legit, and the community too. A project that keeps delivering what they've set out to do, with a beautiful mission to onboard more people into the space, and which seeded many collaborations. https://t.co/Fr9rJS1uD2"
32,"2/ My first was @RTFKTstudios Space Drip capsule. Got in at 1+E and it was a long wait. 

With that, I learnt to be patient and to have a little faith especially if you've done all the homework you can. This stays true even for MNLTH. 💎👐 https://t.co/GyP6N3Fl0A"
33,"1/ My favourite type of mints/buys are those without the hype and with a legit team building a much-loved product. 

This also means coping with a lot of FOMO while watching other projects moon and thinking if-only and what-could-have-been. https://t.co/jvxMxh2psN"

38,"5/ I've gotten Julia to include some important RTFKT history in the piece if you spot them 😉 If you think there are other artefacts we should include, let us know!

Also, while you're at it, check out some of @arlekin_julia's previous works https://t.co/IgUgaFEEAF"
39,"4/ If you think your Clone should join this tea party, feel free to drop them here – I'll leave it to artist @arlekin_julia to decide which Clones she'd like to include in the final piece!"
40,"3/ Should the new owners prefer their Clones to be private, or if I can't identify the owners in time (Friday, 18 Feb). We'll be changing up the Clones to willing #CloneX holders who have found their forever Clones."
41,"2/ So before finishing up the piece, we'd like to check with the owners of Clones #16730, #5069 (@xaltgeist), and #6950 if they're still keen to have their Clones featured.

42,"1/ A month ago, I tweeted this asking the #CloneX fam who would be interested for their Clones to be featured together in a derivative piece with my Top Hat Angel 👼

1. It attracts short-term buyers hoping for a windfall (not good for the community)
2. It says, we don't know how to add value to holders with the money we raise other than holding a raffle"
45,"@ohmyeth @RTFKTstudios Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Yes, RTFKT do always over-deliver in execution as long as you're patient enough (sadly, a large part of the NFT market is not).

It's a well-informed speculative move! Excited to see this plays out for you 🙏"
46,"@ohmyeth Big play! Can I ask, why more MNLTH instead of more Clones?"
47,@RTFKTstudios Happy Valentine's Day everyone! ♥️
48,"@moopidoopi That's not the worst. I can't stand those Tesla or mega prize giveaways. It's just saying:

61,"@Alts_Anonymous @RTFKTLukson Then @RTFKTstudios will tell us, we are not ready."
62,@RTFKTLukson I always wonder: Will vials sell out at 3E if the website wasn't attacked? Will it drop to 2.7E and then sell out like serums? Will people support RTFKT not knowing what they now know?
63,@RTFKTLukson We can turn back the clock and have a proper and functional Mint Vial dutch auction that starts at 3E?
64,"Pre-sale mint has just started and will be ongoing for the next two days. Join the Discord and see if that's something that resonates with you.

For me, it's full of 🅿️. WAGMI."
65,"It's about people and networks, helping out one another, and lifting everyone together. That positive energy and kindness-begets-kindness spirit that's connecting people from all around the world, it's just amazing to watch and a joy to be part of.
https://t.co/hJBGoW3P5W"
66,"If you look into the project's vision (of individuals empowering one another through a wishing well), you'll realise why this ""NFT lending facility"" makes so much sense."
67,"Note: They've not built a loan system (I think there's a strong use case there for people to earn passive income with their NFTs) and it's merely transfer of ownership.

But I can imagine other projects to ride on what they're building to create more complex systems."
68,"@meta_angels NFT can be lent out to a different wallet, transferring ownership of the token over, while the recipient wallet cannot transfer or sell that token.

The owner of the NFT can also recall the NFT any time, and all these are in their smart contract."
69,"Here's when I'll lend a friend my NFTs:
1. Help them access a community
2. Help build Twitter following
3. Help get WL access

In bringing new people into the NFT space, lending out your NFTs can bring incredible value to others."
70,"Have you thought of lending an NFT to someone so that he can benefit from it, especially if you have several copies?

Of course, we might trust our friends to send an NFT back, but what if it's someone across the Internet whom you've never met IRL?"
71,"Every one should check out @meta_angels. Yes, the art is good and the team is strong (and doxxed), but what stands out most for me is their ""NFT lending facility"". https://t.co/sh5uDbgo9y"

79,"@EPIPZA LOL there is really a lot of hate for NFT people. 

From what it is, I feel like the best resolution for all might be to get the artist to refund (cost + claims e.g. time wastage, broke contract), and he find another artist who's aligned, pay more and possibly expedited fees."
80,"@EPIPZA There are terms that the artists sign off to for commercial. Before engaging with an artist for commercial use, I'll always ask for his T&amp;Cs.

If there isn't, the best is to take the case up with Fivver. Give a bad review if can't resolve. And move on to the next artist."

88,@4n6_nerd @RTFKTstudios I think that's possible but I feel that it's too early to drop so much for Clones (and Vials too?). I reckon it's a virtual wearable like previous drops (the last being the Akira hoodie).
