5,"@_itissoroush_ @SuperlativeSS Going forward, as long as you have at least 1 SSS, you’ll be able to exchange an artifact for things like Repus, and future utility, even if you acquired the Artifact on secondary. “Utilizing” would have been a better word choose than “unlocking”."
6,@_itissoroush_ @SuperlativeSS Their response was a bit confusing. 3 SSS should indeed provide you with 3 artifacts.

8,"Each @SuperlativeSS is entitled to a free “Artifact” mint, but only for the next 3 day window. So far, 83% of Artifacts have been burned for #Repus. Artifacts will be ultra scarce.
