0,It's crazy how quickly life can fall apart when you don't have your brain medications.
1,"Haven't been able to get my prescriptions filled for weeks now, doc keeps telling me she sent it but it never arrives. Today she called me and said ""Hi, Zachary?"" and when I said ""No, Sara"" she went ""Oooooooooooooooh"".  

I want to destroy something right now."
2,I made this slide for work and it just makes me LOL https://t.co/ag698TAxR8
3,@tmagled You play this enough I figured I’d tell you I always start with ADIEU. Read somewhere that it’s the most strategic starting point.
4,"This was the first NFT project I started work on, way back in the summer of 2021.  Well, today it finally launched, after countless hours of pixel pushing and fine tuning. Read the hilarious content at https://t.co/EOwUDYBwWV and mint your Suit today! https://t.co/cEjK4bdpQT"

12,@numo_0 I wrote custom in nodejs (JavaScript).
13,@apexmillennia Thank you so much for sharing. Makes me feel less alone.
14,Medical examiner said it was an overdose. Probably fentanyl related. I didn’t cry until I watched the army guys carrying him out in a body bag. Bad day.
15,"My house has been under construction for over a year, and we've had a friend staying there to look after it. The crew just arrived this morning and found him dead in the bedroom. Not sure how to process this information."
16,@BrantlyMillegan @ethleaderboard Sarasioux.eth
17,@jacksondame @ensdomains I wrote a tool for this too @MessagesNft!
18,@4ThangsPodcast I’m sorry I missed it!
19,"I'll be joining this Twitter Space in 5 minutes to talk about @flipmap. Join in and help us craft the future of our emerging universe!

20,"@teipeeee Sure, DM any time. 👍"
21,"@danrobinson I’m a really fast coder but I’m also a procrastinator at getting started. I think it’s because I spend more time designing and planning in my head before I write a line of code, so once I start I move really fast because there are no decisions to make."
22,@NFTLlama Just launched @flipmap!
23,@jacksondame That’s a pretty innovative marketing strategy tbh.
24,@teipeeee Partner with an influencer or an existing community to bake hype into your initial plan.
25,So cool seeing community members develop new tools for @flipmap already. This community is amazing! https://t.co/EEmCKxw46u
26,@enuflark Yeah I have her 3.5 days a week and she cleans so it saves me a ton of time! I basically try to outsource all domestic responsibilities to make more time for side hustles.
27,"@enuflark A nanny, a spot in my office where kids can play on their tablet while I’m working, most meals takeout, and send them to grandma’s on Saturdays."
28,@s17a_xyz Thank you so much!
29,Andy is a great hype man! https://t.co/aAoRJb9S4i
30,Seeing someone else make a video of a UI I built is just pure joy. https://t.co/OEWcOWJNIa
31,@0xmts @flipmap Yeah I tried hard to keep gas requirements low but there's a lot of computations that had to happen to track and validate the pairs soooo.... this is what we got.  :)
32,@kwuchu @flipmap Never tried that before but I’ll see if it’s something I can slip in tonight…
33,@EvanMullins @flipmap @jacksondame @blitmap I fixed wallet connect sorry I forgot to tag you!
34,"@_cophi_ Well, I made Flipmaps.  It's a Blitmap derivative.  Check it out at https://t.co/BKhjjyqvKs!"
35,@iSocialFanz @flipmap @blitmap @dhof Thanks for choosing us as your first mint of the year!
36,"RT @niftypins: 🧵 1/ ""Flipped"" #NFT projects have become de rigueur—but copyright infringement is a gaping problem. Granted, this is probabl…"
37,“Perfect derivative” sure feels good. https://t.co/psQ0ZcQKF6
38,@EvanMullins @jami__jami__ @jacksondame @blitmap Join the discord and I can try to help. I only tested it with MM.
39,"I just launched my first contract of the year! Technical write up forthcoming, this was a tough one to pull off but very satisfying when it worked. https://t.co/a9U2NMnZKp"
40,"@shegenerates Clicked the link, looks like it’s 3 predetermined contracts. That makes more sense!"
41,@shegenerates How does it know the right contract addresses?
42,@kitpsune @gmdotxyz Just followed!
43,One of my New Year’s goals is to launch a web3 social project. Stay tuned.
44,@jacksondame Judi Dench
45,This is why I can’t trust anyone. https://t.co/U3OKIyIp8w
46,@cryptopom1 Bookmarked this tweet so I can steal the answer when you get it.
47,“Web3 fixes this” is the new “there’s an app for that”
48,@MsQueenEarth I have so much data. https://t.co/xYVsz6Bpnw
49,@aaronricketts_ That hair is so amazing! What a cutie.
50,There’s something really unsettling about all of the robots activating at the same hour on Christmas Eve. Almost reads like it was spontaneous and sentient. https://t.co/1xtZrrKUCg https://t.co/H5JP8f1A84
51,@4ThangsPodcast Check out @SwishDreamsNFT if you like cool courts.
52,I’m just about done with the plan. Feedback welcome before I mint. https://t.co/RbnZTmbSng https://t.co/107B9pjXqm
53,Think I’m gonna mint my new year’s resolutions and offer some bonuses to the holder if I meet my goals. A little accountability hack. Stay tuned.
54,Well the robot arrived but he won’t connect to the internet so she’s comforting him. The next generation’s relationship with technology is going to be so different. https://t.co/HdYZlD1B73 https://t.co/RP1lHz0Rid
55,@tombakker_co @doodles @coolcatsnft @alienfrens She looked at those but I had never heard of them so wasn't sure what to say.  Seemed reasonably priced and in a similar art style though.
56,"Second collection she gravitated toward was @doodles.  I just laughed. This kid has expensive taste.

Then she showed me a @coolcatsnft.

I don't think .12 is gonna get her very far."
57,"Just gave each of my stepkids $500 in ETH and a @BoredBananaClub NFT for Christmas. Stepdaughter said ""What can I buy?"" so I set her up on Opensea to shop. First thing she liked? @CryptoMories. Sorry kid, you've only got about .12 to work with, out of your price range."
58,Ordered a robot for my 5-yo for Christmas but it’s not going to arrive in time. So depressing. Also we’ve come a long way from the cardboard robots I used to build as a kid! https://t.co/JGGWSOv0Id
59,@YallStreetG Thanks! I thought it was pretty cool but my friends and family weren’t as impressed as I’d hoped. Only VR nerds get it. ❤️
60,@YallStreetG I used to stream my sick beat saber skills but my husband got annoyed when I kept turning the whole living room into a green screen. https://t.co/h0NPOrLQ5D

62,"Looks like Etherscan has a tool with a simple ""Revoke"" button so you don't have to interact directly with the contract.  Go here to check approvals on all your collections!  https://t.co/iJekLKsdDG"
63,"@MintyFreshNFT Yes, thanks for the link! I've only seen these tools for ERC-20 not ERC-721 before. It works if you go to the ERC-721 tab and click the ""By Contract"" toggle. Glad to know I don't have to leave my tool up forever, but the research continues..."
64,"This is my first pass at addressing this problem, so I’m open to any and all feedback or questions you might have. I’ll be doing some research into stolen apes to see if any of them had suspect contract approvals prior to the incident. Will let you know what I find out! 8/"
65,"If you check your approvals and find something you don't want, feel free to go direct to the BAYC contract and setApprovalForAll on that address, with the approved value of 0. This will revoke their access to your apes.
https://t.co/GCzI9X0fNV 7/"
66,It absolutely blows my mind that a “check all approvals” method is not included in the ERC-721 standard. IMHO that is a gross oversight and something we need to correct in future iterations. 6/
67,"Here's an example of another holder who has approved all for OpenSea, BatchSwap, and the NFT20 liquidity pool. 5/ https://t.co/htnWFcEKU1"
68,"Here is an example of one BAYC holder. They have approved OpenSea to operate on all of their BAYC tokens, and they have approved BatchSwap to operate on one of them. 4/ https://t.co/yZfo767s5x"
69,"But, for certain collections that use the Open Zeppelin 721 contract, we can listen for events that are fired whenever you set approvals. I set up a @graphprotocol subgraph to scan events on the BAYC contract and provide an approval checker just for this collection. 3/ https://t.co/mmX8oSUFJq"
70,"Since approvals are done per-collection, it’s very hard to see who is approved to operate on your tokens. You’d basically have to check every single contract address against isApprovedForAll, which is prohibitively expensive/annoying. 2/"
71,"The ERC-721 standard includes two crucial methods: approve and setApprovalForAll. Both of these methods will authorize another address to transfer your tokens. Approve sets the approval for a single token id, approvalForAll sets it for all tokens in your wallet. 1/"
72,I wrote a little tool to help you check your contract approvals as a BAYC holder. Check it out at https://t.co/vNoFxRWS2c. Learn more about contract approvals in this thread. 🧵
73,@CallMeLatasha @NFT_ish Hi there I'm a dev.  👋

97,@chavilujan I started with the Truffle Suite pet shop tutorial.
98,"@kitpsune I am always nervous. It's a really big deal and I watch the whole thing anxiously awaiting the dreaded ""out of gas"" message. But today was smooth. :)"
99,Today I launched my 7th contract to mainnet. I think that almost qualifies me as an expert in this space.
