1,@codyborn Hey I’ve got a quick question about TokenCast. Could you send me a DM?
2,@codyborn Nice view!
3,@alienfrens https://t.co/ag4HPGel8V
4,@rithikpothu I bet if you made a respectful offer you could snag it for a bunch less. Good looking ape rt 👊
5,I feel like I don’t give my MultiGrill enough love.. so here he is again! @0xApes_NFT #0xapes #yellowarmy #tribe #apefollowape #0xAzuki https://t.co/nvFmPbPTko
6,@benoitbrouilla2 Hi
7,@emereintinge @seemystories 😂
8,"@emereintinge @sabet @tokyopunksnft @Crypto_Skulls @thebunnybuddies No not really! But if he actually DMCA Mories because of some stupid fucking logo he made years ago then this entire space has some serious problems.. today’s mission, find a simple skull with a heart and X  eye that was created before 2010. This is not cool."
9,@ArrowAir_ Stoked on @ArrowAir_! I’ve been quietly building a eVTOL over the past few months. To have a team of pros working on open source hardware/software is a huge help for me. I’d probably crash and die on my own 😂
10,@sabet @tokyopunksnft @Crypto_Skulls @thebunnybuddies Did you DMCA Mories? Be honest.
11,@boredapebot Thankfully the price is coming down! I can finally snag one lol
12,@cryptopeerani1 @CryptoMories @opensea They got DMCA’d
13,RT @GrillPillMax: BREAKING: President Biden has blocked Russian access to Disney Plus
14,@ABigThingBadly I suspect CoolCats dun it.
15,@nftsteven1009 @0xApes_NFT Still at 2
16,"@ABigThingBadly @BoredGutterApes Still not DMCA proof. I went through some legal shit with NBA, NFL, ect.. years ago over some T-shirts I was selling. The fact that the tees were “like colors” was enough for them to file suit."
17,"@KingBlackBored Excellent 🧵! Lol at the people throwing shade, even though your speaking nothing but truth."
18,@Justagu17487070 @KingBlackBored Did you really just make a new account to bash KBB? 😂
19,@theycallmeshwaz @TheShamdoo Lol. He called it a democracy. Ukraine is farrrr from it.
20,"@TheShamdoo Nancy Pelosi, chuck sh, Biden and a few others family has gotten rich from Ukraine. When the left and media both going ham, makes me wonder."
21,"@TheShamdoo What’s happening in Ukraine is their business. Not mine. Besides, is Putan really the bad guy here or is this another Trump scenario where just the Left don’t like him? Seems weird every US dem is backing and letting us know OUR “democracy” needs to back them and pay long term."
22,@monsterapeclub When BAYC giveaway????

33,@0x_GCG @EugeneBWhitaker @ABigThingBadly I just double checked. Says minted on OS but not on my profile. I’ll chill for a bit while it does it’s thing.
34,@0x_GCG @EugeneBWhitaker @ABigThingBadly Tried twice. Nothing sent. Used mint to 0.01 to my address.
35,@0x_GCG @EugeneBWhitaker @ABigThingBadly How to mint with contract?
36,@ABigThingBadly @0x_GCG Which function on contract to mint?
37,@0xApes_NFT @CryptoCocktail_ Do mine! https://t.co/7e4CXnjvZ1
38,"@NathanHeadPhoto Damnit! Me too. I gotta start listening to my intuition. Missed 0xApes at $90ea, Dooggies at $70. Worlds at 2E. Looked at them all. Pondered. Passed. Pissed."

It been incredible linking up with so many like-minded people! 

Anyone struggling to get a following, post your 0x below and we will also link up! #yellowarmy #0xapes #apefollowape"
48,@I_Buy_NFTs @_benxit_ I went thru internet archive and have proven this to be true. I’m surprised more ppl aren’t jumping on Dooggies since these are now facts. But my guess is not many BAYC holders what this to ever see the light of day.

63,@yaiagmi @LongLostNFT Nice skully!
64,"@ShrewdCharlie Thank god we have Opensea, am I right?!  It’s probably best that we crush any competition that doesn’t execute a flawless launch. If they can’t at least meet OS high quality standards then we should FUD em to death! 🤦‍♂️"

69,"RT @JungleFreaksNFT: 🧵1/ In order to know where we're going. We have to first look at where we've been.

Here is your first look at Gen 2.…"
70,@JungleFreaksNFT Hollllly shit!!! There incredible!
71,"@hhfrankfields @NFTherder @WeatheReportNFT I’ve seen this a few other times too. I believe a similar scenario with FishyFrens… once the artist realized how successful the project was going to be, he demanded more $$ even tho an agreement was made prior."
72,"@digi_nam @rayblivingclean @freshkicksnft @0xApes_NFT No, he’s talking about OPs ape."
73,@Ludus14 @0xApes_NFT I typically buy ones based on aesthetics. I should prob pay more attn rarity tho.. https://t.co/fh6n6UqntX
74,"@0x50D9 This was my initial thoughts too. The fees may not cover the value of the coin at todays price. I’m personally going to wait it out and see if they lessen the barrier to entry, since there’s no time limit to collect."
75,"@web3pointhoe @0xApes_NFT You need to follow the yellow army as well. That’s the easiest way to make connections. When I get a follow, I typically follow backs. Welcome!"
76,@Raisvo @V1Islandboy That is such a perfectly suited ape. I added to 0S favorites when it was for sale a week or so ago. The horns with the jacket and eyes 👌👌👌 screams daredevil!
77,@TheChrisJohn @V1Islandboy Trade? https://t.co/D3EoOoh5tj
