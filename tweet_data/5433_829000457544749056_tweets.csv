2,Very happy having these companion pieces in my collection. I love that both have the common thread of a Determined trait with the background on my Superlative and the head on my Repus. I’m definitely going to hodl. Thanks @AriefWitjaksana and @SuperlativeSS I love the art. https://t.co/Muoys1XMYF

12,"Picked up this @SuperlativeSS a week ago. It’s such a diverse, chill, and positive community that doesn’t get a lot of hype, you may not even realize the project is community-led through @SuperlativeDAO and there is a ton of utility on the way with artifacts, the Repus, and more. https://t.co/16mCPTm2Vb"

74,"To close this out, Rajesh R is a customer service all star. Give that agent a raise for having to deal with me. @sprintcare"
75,"For the public record, giving me runaround on Twitter and then sending me a link to your policy page was not the way to handle this. I guess I’ll have to keep trying other methods and letting everyone I know how poor and devoid of empathy @sprint customer care is. @sprintcare"
76,@sprintcare I’m not comfortable sharing that publicly. I’ve sent it via dm.
77,"@sprintcare For the record, I got a response but you should let your supervisors know that asking upset customers to repeatedly provide the same information is terrible customer service."
78,@sprintcare I’ve sent a dm. What is the reasonable time to wait for a response? I would think the response time should be as fast for private dms as it was for public tweets.
79,@sprintcare I’d love to think that would help but I’ve already tried chat which deferred me to call which is difficult when I don’t have a working phone. I’m waiting on a call on someone else’s phone already. I’ll take this private if there is a chance of a timely call back for resolution.
80,Surely these policies can be relaxed in extraordinary times. I’ve been unemployed for six months and had to really stretch to pay off my device because Sprint coverage is so bad in my town. I don’t want to have to keep telling my story publicly. @sprint @sprintcare
81,I have a 3-year-old son in daycare and a parent at very high risk of COVID-19 yet your customer service team is telling me I have to wait over a week to use the phone I’ve already paid for over the final month’s service bill which I can’t even pay yet. @sprintcare
82,.@sprint I’ve paid all outstanding balances on my account but am being told my phone can’t be unlocked until after billing cycles. I can’t be without a phone that long. Is that how you want to treat people in the middle of a pandemic? Really unacceptable.
