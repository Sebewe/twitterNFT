55,@Dookie_Kong @cur_ray I used TurboTax and it integrated well with CoinTracker!
56,@RemixMTG @cur_ray CoinTracker did the NFT stuff for me. Fortunately I didn’t do much in defi so I don’t have to deal with that
57,@DaitoYoshi 😂😂😂
58,@toxickills_eth Yeah I just used CoinTracker and then TurboTax to finish and file everything. Also the gas should be automatically taken into account
