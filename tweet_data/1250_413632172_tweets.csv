56,Bossa Nova is one of the most undeniably beautiful music genres
57,"16/ To me, Kanye symbolizes when human beings can fulfill their potential far beyond their wildest dreams and far beyond what people ever expected from them.

No matter what else he does in the future, I will always take that lesson from Kanye. And I hope you can too."
58,"15/ I remember being 14 years old and sitting on a couch with my parents watching the 2005 Grammy Awards when Kanye performed Jesus Walks. 

I couldn’t explain why, but at the time I told my parents we had to watch the performance because I heard this guy was a ‘special rapper’"
59,"14/ At one point Kanye says, “Before I had a car, I’d be walking to the train practicing my grammy speech.”

I just imagine this earnest kid walking in the freezing Chicago cold practicing this speech he would eventually give in 2005

https://t.co/UhpMYHx3dH"
60,"13/ Whether you like Kanye or not, the story of Jeen-Yuhs is the story of a human being ferociously willing their dreams into existence. 

Kanye is the living embodiment of how manifestation and hard work can actually succeed beyond your wildest dreams."
61,"12/ IMO - Last Call is the most Kanye song he has ever recorded - half-song, half-heartfelt monologue, with the classic line 

“Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem or use my arrogance as a steam to power my dreams.”"
62,"11/ I’m looking forward to the next episode where I’m expecting they’ll cover his car accident, recording Through The Wire, and hopefully hopefully hopefully they’ll show him recording Last Call"
63,"10/ Everyone who has a parent should be touched by the scene where Kanye is speaking with his mother Donda. 

Cootie said again, “It was easy to see the confidence he had in himself was because of the confidence Donda had in him.”"
64,"9/ In one interview, Kanye addressed so many of the doubts and criticisms aimed at him by saying 

“I’m gonna use everything that everybody says I an’t do and flip it to the positive.”

It's not easy to have that mindset, but he did."
65,"8/ At one point, one of Kanye's oldest friends from the Chicago hip hop scene writes a diss track directed at Kanye

You can tell that really hurt Kanye as he considered this person a mentor"
66,"7/ The entire film you are seeing a humbled, low-key Kanye, compared to how he’s portrayed today

You see him not getting noticed/recognized/respected at different events

You see the first time he introduces himself to Pharrell"
67,"6/ People forget how different Kanye’s rap was compared to mainstream hip hop at the time. Kanye helped bring in a new socially conscious hip hop wave

Songs on The College Dropout talk about Jesus, critiques of materialism, cheesy love for family, after school programs, etc."
68,"5/ It’s painful and awkward to see people ignore him and for him to walk out of the offices dejected

Most people don’t realize that the early part of Kanye’s story was that people didn’t think he could go from being a successful producer to successful rapper"
69,"4/ Cootie, the filmmaker, said “the thing that struck me most about Kanye was how much he believed in himself. He fought every day to get others to believe too.”

Kanye went to the Roc-A-Fella records and played “All Falls Down” to anyone who would listen"
70,"3/ The documentary focuses on Kanye creating The College Dropout, his first album and one of the greatest hip hop albums of ALL TIME

Against all odds, Kanye’s drive, passion, and vision allowed him to accomplish his goals"
71,"2/ If you’re a Kanye fan, you’ll already know that Kanye’s belief in himself is one of the biggest reasons for his success

If you aren’t a Kanye fan, the documentary will help you understand this"
