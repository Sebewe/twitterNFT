my reaction 🤦🏻‍♂️

It’s ok to use other people’s tweets as a starting point, but they don’t say DYOR (Do your own research) for nothing.

2,"@Tatyanna_Dumas I was just talking about this today. Things I see in this space sometimes remind me of the movie “Idiocracy”. While some people are getting smarter, some are following the herd and doing the exact opposite. https://t.co/Zf96onc7WH"
3,"@theluvjonze @womensday It’s a shame that tweets like this still exist in 2022. I sure hope that at some point in my lifetime people will be looked at as equals regardless of sex, race, sexual orientation, and anything else people are bias against today. #BreakTheBias #WhenEquality #TogetherWeRaise"
4,"@NFTherder 1) Anyone who knows you, knows you don’t shill NFTs. You may highlight good parts of projects or talk about really good overall projects like OCM, but that is organic conversation.
2) You don’t owe anyone squat unless you signed a contract or are making up for a mistake you made."
5,@NFTherder They are lucky you don’t post a screen shot of their demand. That alone would be enough to turn me off from their project and share with my followers and communities.

19,"Keep an eye out. Next mini trend may be the projects claiming to donate to Ukraine so they sell out. Don’t just buy into a project because they are donating to Ukraine. If you want to donate to Ukraine, just do it yourself so 💯 goes to the charity not some % chosen by a project."

42,A few days ago I posted an @OnChainMonkey for an amount that I would have been ok to sell it at. Today with the auction almost over I’m starting to think I posted it too low at 5ETH. I mean this this one is clean and does remind me of @Coinbase_NFT &amp; @warriors What do you think?
