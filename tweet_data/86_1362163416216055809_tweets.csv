7,"@NftCelestials @LooksRareNFT @gridplus @Trezor Fuck off with your assumptions. Never used anything but a po box. But new users that are TOLD to start with a hardware wallet for their crypto journey don’t, and others won’t for many other reasons. I’m not gonna reward a company for that kind of misbehaviour."
8,"@NftCelestials @LooksRareNFT @gridplus @Trezor Ledger leaked the data of a good chunk of their users, putting some of them in great danger. Can never really trust them after that, personally."
9,"Seems to be a pattern here, after @LooksRareNFT, huh? Tired of ETH users being considered second class citizens. Will complete my move to @gridplus and will never touch a @Trezor product again in my life. This whole dick swinging odyssey has lasted for months. Enough is enough. https://t.co/v6mNrgL8Ac"

16,@cadewalkergreen @Bitcojner @michael_olenick @bitrefill How would they do that?
17,"Not sure who still needs to hear this, but when you read shit like this, it’s when you RUN the fuck away. Disgusting. https://t.co/kSNA596CyA"
18,"@cadewalkergreen @Bitcojner @michael_olenick Still a fair amount, actually. Things like @bitrefill basically allow you to live crypto native without need of an offramp."
19,"@DavidReesArtist Maybe some. Definately not most. Besides, teust me. Somebody “just entering the space” is jot shelling 30k for a Kevin. Matter of fact, someone “just entering the space” has no fuckinh clue what a Kevin is 99% of the time. It’s just a memetic circlejerk of hot potato."
20,@FUBZAR Now THAT is facts. Just nfttrade it or something if one must.
21,"@keeganft Yup, I absolutely confirm what I said. People should buy whatever the fuck with their money. Not sure why what you think “is right” in terms of spending should go for everyone else."
22,Oh and I got none. Just to be clear. It’s trash.
23,"My take on Kevins? It’s a meme and it will end up badly. 

Also my take on Kevins? People should do and buy WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY WANT with their money, and then take responsability for good or bad. Most “concerned” samaritans  are pissed cause that eth isn’t pumping their bags."
24,@LoganOP_gm @CircaDiem @ABigThingBadly And these are FACTS.
25,There’s always a reason. And it’s always goddamn money. https://t.co/XK1hsV0nHU
26,"@cadewalkergreen This, yes"
27,@great_espace There is no point in charting any of this shit rn. It’s all macro driven. It will be event based.

Permissionless. 

The moment of truth approaches. I’m standing proud on Satoshi’s shoulders."
30,"@2oast I think there will be hard regulatory reckoning. And it tends to not be very thoughtful, historically speaking. What I’m saying is the genie is out of the bottle now. For good or for badthere’s no going back. I would’ve preferred a couple more years under the radar to strenghten."

50,@Stoniphantom @SGTurbo1 @jimi_ethers @GutterCatGang @ABigThingBadly @Bcpaintball26 @Sonyblack65 @zscuffed That’s just cats though isn’t it? It’d be cool ( and more accurate ) to have one for cats plus all species.

53,"@shinedairz @Ape2047 @TakeoffTone Ofc it’s in the crator’s right. Just as much as it’s in the buyer’s right ( me ) to invest accordingly. Not sure what you’re on about. 

Re: infinitesupply. Books get reprinted all the time. And the supply is theoretically infinite. Not into wasting time discussing dialetics tbh."
54,Rugged. https://t.co/CdMvN4e8Xl
55,"@shinedairz @Ape2047 @TakeoffTone No. And that’s why these cost 20 bucks, are infinite prints, and are consumption goods."
56,@BrianNyc14 ✅
57,@Ape2047 @TakeoffTone Litterally all of mine too. I don’t think I put size into a single collection that doesn’t allow full IP ownership
58,@Willmatic19 @carsonturner @Nobel_Zobel Absolutely! And clean af too 🍻
59,"@carsonturner @Nobel_Zobel And yes, would be really cool to compile a full list of perfect sets actually. Really cool. Maybe @raritytools or @RaritySniperNFT can help us and/or add it to their rankings?"
60,@carsonturner @Nobel_Zobel Love it homie!
61,2/ BAYC 3902 aka King Noiz https://t.co/s9VnMAyU1U
62,"There’s only a few dozens perfect sets in the collection. And the most rare, insane statistical anomaly in perfect sets sits in my vault. But that’s a story for another time…

Here’s the KING NOIZ perfect set in all it’s glory! Cheers apefam 🙌 https://t.co/Vb9iptYoDv"
63,"becomes a staple in collectibles at large, and as the market matures, these perfect sets will go for crazy premiums. I have been a collector my whole life, when a brand/series becomes iconic, things like these become priceless grails. Also, added bonus, it just pleases my ocd 😂"
64,"set ladies and gents! And yes, this fella is doggo 3902, same serial AND same fur as it’s og. Will this matter for $APE multiplayers, or other goodies down the line as the roadmap unravels? Who knows, I’m in the less likely camp tbh. BUT. What I do know for sure is that if BAYC https://t.co/B8pMSeIDyg"
65,"ask? Welp, I got theories 😂 A full set is OG ape, his m1 and m2 and ( imho ) it’s same serial doggo. For others, it’s more about having the doggo woth the same fur and/or specific traits. But what if in some cases we make everyone happy and have both? Welp, now that’s a PERFECT"
66,"The next installmet of “stories from the vault” brings us King Noiz! 

The only Noise crown in the collection, beautiful chromatics grey on grey and a perfectly boring b/w T. BORED AF. King Noiz is also the ape that got me to nerdout about perfects sets. What’s a perfect set you https://t.co/4Urt2O69iy"
67,"So we’re getting mutants huh…
Should be a fun week in the gutter. https://t.co/SedHDslN7W"
68,@bettertorun @NakuSama_ @GutterCatGang I’m really hoping for something expansive and inclusive. Full set only would not be very good imho. There’s always been a problem with volumes and a smaller community.
69,@NakuSama_ @GutterCatGang So we’re getting mutants looks like? Damn I hate riddles…

76,@GoTrillaGorilla It’s a good thing the world is a much much larger space than the USA then 😂
77,"@ABigThingBadly Well the thing is there’s not much to see/miss or scream about here imho. Until details are given, there’s just a logo image. Would LOVE to hear more."
78,@realMisterPip Do you have links or @ for more details on all of it?
79,@NarutoCharizard Numbers clearly disagree.
80,"@reubs1231 Yeh but there’s something odd to it. I live and breathe this shit, have 50 pidgeys and @GutterCatGang and somehow even I missed it. Weird."
81,"Wait, how the fuck did I miss this? Why is it not making any noise and are there more details anywhere ?!? https://t.co/uvmB09YWji"

96,"@Nate_Rivers @HOWLERZNFT @rhemanth93 +1 on that. Would’ve bought and supported, but the fuckups on the drop are unacceptable."
97,"So we where told the 7th, then 14th, then 24th for the Met@mask update for the Trezor fix and other important updates. At this point it’s embarrassingly clear the goal post just gets moved nonstop, deadlines being disattended. Can’t wait for competition to ramp up."
