1,"(10/10) At the retreat, @Ozery and I ripped it up on the slopes in Breckenridge. Alpha: snowboarding down moguls is difficult.

ETHDenver was a lot of fun this year. We loved seeing friends again.

Our dapp is coming soon! Follow @will3plan to stay updated! https://t.co/1iPAby7ntS"
2,"(9/10) The @MintGoldDust auction lit up the sports castle stage on the last night.

We got 2 RarePepes! One from the auction and one from the raffle. Special thanks to @LeValleyKelly and @theog__ for a great time! https://t.co/L9dOA8cxLE"
3,"(8/10) @ginge_eth and I were in Denver chatting with folks about a dapp we're launching soon.

She was also there being an amazing representative for @ENS_DAO. She and some of the other steward team independently organized to drop alpha at ETHDenver. @Coltron_eth

4,"(7/10) I had a fun conversation with @evmlabs over shots of chartreuse. We talked about #web3 games and engagement designs of existing web2 games. 🎮

I strongly believe in games as one of the ""killer apps"" of web3."
5,"(6/10) I count myself lucky to have continuously met amazing people. The bufficorn lounge, that opened later in the week, was a great place for stimulating conversations. @NFTMerchant @Garrett_DeFi @ChazSchmidt  @katy_kin @imrane @ginge_eth @AJEhrenberg_ @patonchain @DillonLong3"
6,"(5/10) The registration line that we'd gone through in about 15 minutes less than a week earlier ballooned to a multi-hour standfest. ⏳

Sidenote - If you stood next to GOATs like @prodjkc, @pbrody, @AlexanderFisher in that line, you probably got to learn some amazing things."
7,"(4/10) Tuesday of the next week was when it really got started.

More friends came into Denver, and so did a lot of new faces. I noticed that the main areas of the conference got much more congested."
8,"(3/10) There were great talks at the Art Hotel.

The space for ETHDenver on the 4th floor was cozy, but it was big enough for the amount of people who were there. That was going to change a few days later. 😅"
9,(2/10) @ginge_eth and I drove for two days to get to Denver with our bear of a puppy dog (6 months old). We got in town at the beginning of Buidl Week. https://t.co/cC5lsE5gLP
10,"(1/10) Finally home and recuperating from #ETHDenver and the retreat. 🏂

Wanted to give a quick retrospective from this year's event.

TLDR - Puppy loved the snow. We won a raffle. Snowboarding was great. I'm more excited than ever to continue buidling! We're raising. 💰#web3"
