79,"As someone getting back into @nbatopshot, I have a couple questions:
1⃣ Am I able to buy/sell more than one moment at a time yet?
2⃣ Should I finally buy into Cool Cats? Last I recall, NLL is supposed to be the group to be a part of.

Thoughts overall would be great. 🙏 https://t.co/a4sD9eNr6t"

Pfps are great, but plays create an emotional connection long before they become TS moments."
