12,@bivnft Definitely
13,@bivnft I think it’s more about what type of book people think it should be(like he said) vs. what exactly he’s gonna be doing with it. I’m excited though. That’s what I like about Klosterman. Looks at topics amazingly unique.
14,@bivnft But What If We Were Wrong was so good! Just heard him on the Bill Simmons podcast  talking about the book.  Looking forward to it

21,Hey @NFL No worries but I must’ve missed the invite. No offense taken I’m sure it was an oversight.
22,I hope all the #CoolCatsNFT holders are doing alright minting/seeing their eggs. If you’re having issues you can always email support@coolcatsnft.com. I can try and help too (As much as I can) you can always mint through contract or see your egg through OS activity  or LooksRare

65,@0x_fxnction You think $7 is real? Don’t get me wrong I’m pretty in on it. $7 would be amazing. The idea seems bullish. Hope the execution can come through

83,@JeffKCollins 100% Like the new challenge format. Perfect way to keep collectors engaged. Really started buying more because of it. But more importantly im now trying to anticipate moments in challenges/thinking of collecting strategy. New challenges are like their first version of utility.
84,@JeffKCollins I still can’t help myself. Still buying moments like a maniac. They make the UI too fun. Just wanna open packs. Doesn’t help that I just like collecting shit in general. Just taps into that I guess.

86,@blakejamieson A project where you’re looking to give people an opportunity? Then maybe be a little more loose with your criteria. A project looking to sustain and maybe be something important? Then more of your time may be the key. Submissions and interviews etc.
