61,"@NadavAHollander @dfinzer @opensea Did @opensea use an email campaign sent to all users, with a “click here” big blue box, to migrate their listings before the Feb 25th deadline?  If so, why?  Why when this is prone to phishing and hacking?"
62,"RT @chains_nft: Is this the part where we say “probably nothing”?

63,"@crawlerseth @dfinzer Exactly, positioning everyone for failure. Positioning the hackers for success."

67,"@ReaderCatMe @MattQuirk30 @Nesotual @opensea Yes, they use a flawed strategy prone to hacks, then victim blame when it fails.  When it’s their brand taking the hit."
68,"@alc_anthro @CryptoAube @opensea Yes, I did see the update saying this. That was helpful. It lacked the confirmation that OS sent legit emails, and it lacked any acknowledgement as to why they used the “email with link” strategy in the first place, or if they would evaluate this going forward."
69,@CryptoAube @opensea It’s was a predictable point of failure
70,"@CryptoAube @opensea Agree. I’m taking this a step further in saying that, companies like OS have a responsibility to think carefully about their strategy for migrations like this one. I’m saying that using emails with links was a poor choice in the first place, has damaged their brand and others."
71,RT @lightmaster40: @ScottBussing @opensea I also do not understand why @opensea is not issuing clarification about authenticity of the emai…
72,@lightmaster40 @opensea Exactly.
73,"@CryptoAube @opensea I’m not a victim. I didn’t click the blue box.  Thankfully so, because if I was a victim, some people believe that my right to challenge the use of emails, with links, by OS, would then be taken away. Therefore, those implying that I’m a “stupid victim” will need to work harder."
74,"@dfinzer Hello @opensea, can you please answer the question: why use emails with blue boxes containing hyperlinks, sent to users, in the first place? This is prone to phishing attacks and failure. If you did, the approach was flawed and has damaged your brand and the community. Please lmk"
75,"@pottoro3000 @dfinzer I’m not a victim.  I’m carrying the torch for the victims, so that people like you cannot say “shut up, it’s your fault, get over it”.  Try another approach. Can I suggest research or a counter argument?"
76,"@crypto_snaps @opensea By your logic, since I’m not compromised, does this mean that it’s OK for me to challenge a flawed OS strategy?  Or, if I was one of the unfortunate victims, my rights to have an opinion are then withdrawn? Please lmk"
77,"@FinnNFT @PltTiger @opensea It’s not a rumor that OS chose to use an email strategy for this listings transfer. Hackers knew right away that this was their opportunity, IMO https://t.co/Q5UY670Tvn"
78,@Link_Gus @opensea Some people got the authentic safe email. High- value targets (not me) received either the original (secure) and the phishing attack emails ( I.e. multiple emails). My argument is that this email strategy was a poor decision in the first place.
79,@crypto_snaps @opensea Assuming much?  I didn’t interact with the email. Is this your critical thinking on display?  The CEO says on the OS website that emails would be sent. I’m simply advancing the argument that this was a flawed approach prone to hacking. My account was not compromised. https://t.co/G1PGIVAOON
80,"@crypto_snaps @opensea No, I didn’t. Just because I’m advancing the argument that OS used a flawed email approach, prone to hacks, doesn’t meant that you should assume that I’ve been compromised."
81,"@pottoro3000 @dfinzer Assuming much??  I was careful and didn’t click the link.  By the way, it’s not a link, it’s a blue box. Since the world knows this can be compromised, I’m advancing the argument that’s this was a poorly thought out approach by OS"
82,"@crypto_snaps @opensea I can’t speak for why the team uses this language.  However, you are free to go to the OpenSea website and see this screenshot where the CEO clearly says that the community will be receiving emails this week. The one and only that I’ve received yesterday is presumably authentic https://t.co/1R9QxZExp3"
83,@ITsKenleyMF @opensea Here ya go https://t.co/WSw7QocZjr
84,"@opensea What’s next, an email with a big blue box that says “click here for an update” on the investigation? What could go wrong?"
85,RT @PMads042: @digitalartchick @dfinzer It’s suspicious that the CEO did not address that
86,"@dfinzer Pardon me but you are either ignoring or evading the question that most of us are asking: Why use links hidden behind blue boxes in the first place? Isn’t this prone to phishing attacks,setting the community up for failure? https://t.co/E93CJNHBGH"
87,@opensea https://t.co/Eeho8U6RsQ
88,"@ITsKenleyMF @opensea Since every hour of every day when I buy and sell, and receive offers.  In other words ALL THE TIME.  you must not be using them much"
89,"@Nesotual Why would @opensea be using emails with LINKS for the community update re contract transfer notification in the first place?  Everyone knows they are prone tampering. My argument is that this was a poor decision, setting people, and the process, up for failure. https://t.co/GdsVfRyJ83"
90,"@Mecha_Kong @dfinzer Exactly. You’d think the CEO could confirm that his company sent out a legit email, and it was copied by phishing. Or the CEO could say the team never sent the email that was compromised by phishing attacks, landing us at this unfortunate but predictable place"
91,@RJGonzalez40 @dfinzer Do you have any more screenshots?
