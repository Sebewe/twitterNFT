56,"7/ I voted for @Climate_DAO because the more people we have involved in the healing of the planet, the better off we will be. Co-ownership models can change how we tackle climate change together from a bottom up approach rather than relying our failing institutions."
57,6/ I voted for @BTLvid because I believe that more co-owned non-biased news is good for humanity. A co-owned sports network is a great way to find initial common ground and begin to set a precedent for how co-owned news networks could work at scale.
58,"5/ I voted for @G_Y_O_C because I believe in wild and crazy ideas that change the way humans do things by using biological processes that mirror and heal nature while solving real issues. The solutions are there for us, we just need to look to nature."
59,4/ I voted for @twalixyz because finding quality talent in web3 can be challenging for projects. There needs to a be a more transparent and co-owned marketplace for web3 talent that aligns the interests of all parties.
60,"3/I voted for @gmgnsupplyco because we need more web3 IRL, and consumer products are a great way to kickoff the idea of co-owned real world products, assets, and brands. It has never been easier to create products, and a group of owners around a more responsible model could be✨"
61,2/ I voted for @BoysClubCrypto because I believe in giving women and non-binary people the space to journey through web3 and crypto in a warm and welcoming environment. That is what Seed Club represents at its core.
