8,@edrovera Perhaps it’s root bound if it’s in a pot which could be the problem

35,@edrovera How long have you had your vine? I planted these in the spot my most prolific tomato vines were last season so that will either be a good or a bad thing. 🤣time will tell...
36,@edrovera I planted two during the fall/winter and one of them already had some fruit on it that ripened. The other didn't have fruit but it's very green. I'm excited to see how they fare during this spring.

53,Wouldn’t trade that 15 years of living smack dab in the middle of Frisco (never call it San Fran 😉) for anything but Oakland feeds my soul. 🙏🏾
54,Have to admit moving to #Oakland was one of the BEST decisions I’ve made since moving to Cali in 2006. I love it here. #BlackJoy 💜
