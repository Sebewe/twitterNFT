6,Most successful people are an “overnight success” that took years of grinding to make
7,"@cr0ssETH And the joke of pleading $2m to fix this is like “oh no, caught with our pants down, sorry!”"
8,"@cr0ssETH Pixelmon is like “I’ve been building games for many years, sounds like a great idea to start a company for gaming. Just need the funds, but no one would give it to me for maybe developing a game. Unrevealed NFTs are the answer!”"
9,@0xQuit @0xQuit are they serious? Taking pride in “no roadmap”
10,"@azfnft @RemixMTG Maybe they are going to wait for the game that will never come, so they are stacking rares"
11,"@0xQuit Seems like it’s the classic “I’m an engineer, I know how to build a great game, it’s probably a good idea to start a company” (TDLR: it’s not)"
12,"@azfnft Totally agree, NFTs are no different from any other startup. Add value to the world and the customer base that you are targeting, innovate, under promise over deliver, don’t pollute the cap table etc. all are relevant for both"
13,@daniel100eth Put into $wrld and buy @nftworldsNFT
14,"Just bet $1500 on Pixelmon reveal and lost, probably better to fly out to Vegas and gamble red/black. Better odds too"
15,"@doublesNFT @3Landers Thanks for elaborating on your findings! wish you all success! in the example of @BoredApeYC they brought a lot of innovation and utility for holders, are you not concerned about the fact that there is no roadmap for those?"
16,"Can you get rich with #NFT? Yes! you can also get rich gambling and in other ways. If you are into NFT for the money you are doing it wrong, be there for the value"
17,"Here's some #NFT alpha for you: a project with no roadmap, or a roadmap that says ""bring utility to holders"" is NGMI"
18,@FunGiBLeGameR Rip-off projects are the worst
19,"If a projects roadmap is ""adding community value"" consider it as them saying ""we have no clue"""
20,"@liambakers @1230 US, yeah all depends on how short this is going to be and is it the beginning of global instability"
21,Well that was a quick rebound.. or dead cat jump?
22,"Everyone says this dip is about the war, easy to forget there’s &gt;7% inflation going on as well"
23,"Thinking about all of those in war, hope everyone stays safe ❤️"
24,"Lived through tech bubble to see pets dot com, through sub prime to see bear stearns, ICO boom to see $SRN, and now a project with no roadmap gets &gt;10E FP. Real value should always beat greed"
25,"@Cosmo_886 @MetaHero_ @GutterCatGang @BoredApeYC @InvsbleFriends I call it stupid not interesting, no roadmap for those friends"
26,"Invisible friends might indicate the peak of the #NFT bubble. Nice art, no roadmap (that I could find), instant &gt;10 floor price. Just stupid"

30,"Google is the same, many years until it took off https://t.co/Uc07A8Vmav"
31,DYOR and NFA but you should all look at @nftworldsNFT as they stand a chance to be the underlying layer of the metaverse and their token is under $500m market cap. Disclosure: I’m holding

35,@azfnft https://t.co/8Igwlksp4y
36,"@azfnft Agree with those, and with schedule free time. When I allocated time to meet people and provide value, I met some of the best people I’ve known"
37,"@K3n_eth Who needs NFTs when you can get into $wrld ;) but in full honesty haven’t seen something interesting lately, all copycats"
38,Remember when we couldn’t buy online with credit cards because their number will get stolen? today reminded me of those days
39,"@iamarkdev @smokethatdank1 @K3n_eth @nftworldsNFT @TheSandboxGame Incredible! rooting for you, like I said I’m in :)"
40,"@smokethatdank1 @K3n_eth @nftworldsNFT @TheSandboxGame Let’s see, the proof is in the pudding can they scale?
“In 2021, Sandbox's user base has grown five-fold, reaching 500,000 wallets. It also has over 30,000 monthly active users, about half of whom spend more than an hour per day on the metaverse”"

42,"@smokethatdank1 @K3n_eth Thanks, I’m holding a bag already so would love that :) but I’d be very cautious to make such comparisons without showing why they are comparable. For example: saying that Tesla is worth $1T so $1T for lucid this year is very reasonable is not true"
43,@K3n_eth Based on what? What’s the current market cap?
44,"@liambakers Agree it’s going to be hard to deliver on utility, but what I liked about the team so far is innovative ways of delivering utility so I think that this would live up to the hype. Plus: lots of whales backing it so “too big to fall”"
45,$wrld 🤯 @nftworldsNFT
46,@AlyssaMetaverse What’s your goal?
47,"@boredape93 @cdixon @LooksRareNFT Competition is good (as long as they don’t coordinate prices ;)), in web2 and web3"
48,"@LTCFAN1 @boredape93 @cdixon @LooksRareNFT I would differentiate between token price and the value of the platform. Build a killer platform and growth hack volume, then token value increases and users pour in -&gt; virtuous cycle"
49,"Web3 projects are the same as any startup/successful company. You provide value and differentiation to win: You could be first mover (@larvalabs ), innovate with mutants (@BoredApeYC ), unique value (@nftworldsNFT connecting to Minecraft) etc. if you just imitate others you lose"
50,"@boredape93 @cdixon Where did you see that they don’t apply? Open sea’s volume of users makes it very difficult to unseat their position, like @LooksRareNFT is trying to do, need to be creative to find ways to grow (suggestion: pull the same trick that Airbnb did with Craigslist)"
51,"@cdixon Gold hunt game community taking ownership to save the game from gas fees, including a top developer joining the original team to bridge to L2"
52,"@atxape Holding, no point of selling. We just need more people to use the platform"
53,If everything is “alpha” then it’s actually the index
54,"@azfnft Thanks again for the math! The launch and execution so far is pretty poor, the value prop over LR is romantic but sounds like a solution looking for a problem. We shall see"
55,"@eddyiskongz @doodles Art is well received, but their bet for roadmap is toys, are you bullish about that?"
56,"@HollanderAdam Totally, I’m pulling after hours and sleeping less but feel energized"
57,It’s estimated that only 1%-5% of day traders return profits. Flippers in #NFT are like day traders. Focus on buying value-creating long term projects and not flipping
58,"@ishverduzco Guadalajara is great, You can also visit the city of Tequila. Pátzcuaro is a quaint little town"
59,"Thinking about spinning up an auto generator for new  #NFT projects. They all are like “8888 creatures released to the metaverse, we will have free NFT for holders, 3d NFT, staking and amazing utility”"
60,@GefflotKillian My PFP
61,Looking at the failed @the_x2y2 launch makes you appreciate the successful @LooksRareNFT launch and execution
62,@0xQuit @the_x2y2 Thank you! Should I do a thread about their product and value prop?

64,"In case you're wondering, yes discord is down https://t.co/niojKA2lvA"
65,@azfnft @0xQuit how about some math around $wrld ? what are your thoughts?
66,"“Innovative” doesn’t mean the best long term. Altavista was innovative and Google won, MySpace was innovative and Facebook won. Don’t follow the hype, look at fundamentals: team, execution, generating value"
67,"@0xQuit I like these, resembles SPAC when investors put their money before they know the company the SPAC will merge with, they can take it back. Lockout period. Could also ask to reveal some financials and use of proceeds as another layer"
68,"Full disclosure: I’ve been there from early days and have a large crew, fascinating to see nevertheless"
69,"One of the most interesting stories in #NFT is developing these days with @goldhuntgame . Gas fees killed the game, community took it and jumped to move to L2 + plan roadmap, will relaunch soon and we will see if successful"
70,#BAYC commercial tomorrow? airdrop for $ape? we shall wait and see
71,"@Laurel_Bore I don’t think that it is live yet, someone would come up with a different concept and will get rewarded"
72,The biggest use case for NFT hasn’t been invented yet
73,@K3n_eth @KarafuruNft looks promising
74,"@JRNYcrypto The same happened in the late 90s, lots of hot air in a bubble of bad companies. But there was also Amazon. The good projects will sustain and flourish"

82,"@apap67034556 @yollancohen זה לא אומר כלום, זה יכול לדוגמא להגיד שמחוסנים חושבים שהם חסינים ולכן מתנהגים יותר בחופשיות ונדבקים באומיקרון. המידע כרגע הוא שחיסון עדיין מגן ממחלה קשה"
83,"@apap67034556 @yollancohen שוב, אתה מסתכל על אומיקרון ואני מסתכל על הוריאנטים האחרים, כבר ברור שהאפקטיביות של החיסונים במניעת הדבקה באומיקרון פחותה"

87,@apap67034556 @yollancohen כמה פשוט להתעלם מהנתון שהבאתי ולחזור על המנטרה שלך. בהצלחה עם המלחמה במדע
