You only get limited downside protection, and your upside is deleveraged, whereas with a call your downside is the cost of the call and the upside is 1x"

51,"@R66666666663 @Mudit__Gupta Locking simply creates an inefficiency that's utilized by Convex, with basically the same outcome as a tradeable ve token except a ton of value is captured by Convex rather than Curve itself"
52,"@R66666666663 @Mudit__Gupta I would seriously doubt that, 4 years is practically an eternity in crypto, how many ICO coins from 4 years ago (2017-2018) still have value today?"
53,"@tunasandwich43 The innovation is more on the gauge side I think, the idea of letting people permissionlessly redirect emissions was pretty innovative. CRV &gt; veCRV just takes CRV out of circulation, which burning can do better"
54,Goblin town https://t.co/dgcduZIPSy
55,"@adrianleb Yes, surprised stuff like axie became popular before this became a thing"
56,"@Mudit__Gupta I don't think it makes sense actually. The non-tradeability further pushes lockers to consider the tokens sunk cost, which means they have close to nothing at stake when making decisions affecting the protocol and try to maximize their value extraction instead"
57,"@tunasandwich43 Good question! I also thought about this, I think it kinda reveals how Curve's token locking doesn't *really* add value and it's all just ponzinomics"
58,"@popular_12345 NFT worlds uses NFTs to represent individual servers I think (hence ""worlds""), I'm talking about using NFTs to represent land plots in the same server

Makes more sense to buy land in an already popular server than buy a server and spend a ton of effort making it popular IMO"
59,@fiveoutofnine Exactly! Surprised nobody is doing it. Can prob raise $50m seed round in this market kek

61,"This has at least two benefits:

- Vote tokens are easily tradeable, so no need for Convex-esque projects on top
- Can use simple staking pool contracts to implement gauges &amp; native bribing, rather than having to fork the complex Curve contracts (written in Vyper no less)"
62,"A tokenomics brain worm:

With ve-tokens, tokens locked up for 4 years are usually considered suck cost by lockers. To simplify things, what if you just burnt tokens permanently to get vote tokens, which lets you vote on gauges, get revenue share, etc"
63,"You probably have to work with Java though, that's the downside"
64,"Free idea for gamefi peeps:

Build a Minecraft server, and sell plots of land as NFTs

Simple, better than cryptovoxels since you have access to Minecraft items &amp; mechanics, better than NFT worlds since land in a popular server is more valuable than worlds with unknown popularity"
