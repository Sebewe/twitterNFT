46,It looks like @tobiasdeml has created something special here 🎥 Having interviewed many of the same folks and from what we can see here we’re very excited to check it out and it seems to be hitting the right issues.

65,"@AMCdiamondhand1 @TuckerCarlson Money effects politics. Politics effect regulation.  Regulation effects “stonks”

In a word: everything"
66,@ApeStreetMillis @AMCdiamondhand1 @TuckerCarlson Yes. 🙌
67,@AMCdiamondhand1 @TuckerCarlson We cannot ignore politics. A democracy by its very definition requires politics and healthy discourse. To turn a blind eye is to condone those who seek to rip us apart. Imagine saying “politics = division” when Hitler invaded the Sudetenland. Look what happened.
68,@AMCdiamondhand1 @TuckerCarlson Innocent people will die. We care about innocent people. Apes have lives outside of stocks.
69,Of you 🤦‍♂️
70,"America is far from perfect, but don’t let domestic partisan politics blind you from the truth. 

Yeah. Not stocks.  But this is important. To our 🇺🇦#apes we’re thinking of yoy."
71,Supporting Putin means turning your back on our Allies and the principles Americans have fought (and died for). You and anyone condoning or praising his actions are on the wrong side of history.  You are a traitor.
72,Anyone supporting Putin or watering down his actions (looking at you @TuckerCarlson ) is severely misguided and we implore you to take a step back. This is a man that threatens to challenge everything we’ve built since the end of WWII in the name of self aggrandizement. https://t.co/CZ2Yex7l44
