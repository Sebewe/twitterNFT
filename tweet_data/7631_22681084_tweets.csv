I learned about charity: water through their partnership with @Gemini on the Bitcoin Water Trust which launched in June 2021.

@cameron and @tyler (founders of Gemini) personally matched the first 50 #bitcoin donated.

48,"@pinedegen @sartoshi_nft Alternatively, the #mfers deriv landscape could evolve over time into something higher quality than we see today. Relationships and networks from within the community will become more reliable as time goes on. Perhaps that leads to more derivs coming from within the community."
49,@pinedegen It's probably even higher than 98% with zero long term value just based on the sheer volume of straight up worthless derivs launching. It will phase out over time and the og @sartoshi_nft #mfers will be left standing along with maybe a couple to a few derivs still alive.

There will be more scams, cash grabs, and rugs within this category than any other.

Consider:

Who is the team/artist?
Have they been around?
Where are mint proceeds?
Royalties?
Community treasury?
Undisclosed paid promos?
