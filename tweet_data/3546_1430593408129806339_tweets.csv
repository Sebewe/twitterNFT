52,@KickPosters @DeadfellazNFT Did the same thing today. So hopefully not https://t.co/iTlGlpc7Ic
53,@FitBBook @DeadfellazNFT Some people from adidas bought into the project so I think there some rumors on adidas working with them but overall it’s just a really well run project it was only a matter of time it would make a run
54,Been eyeing this project for a while kind of upset at myself for how long it took me to actually pull the trigger. But we are here now @DeadfellazNFT https://t.co/t2JDfjYu3D

71,I'm so curious how Nike stepping into the space is going to go. They usually don't play well with others.

81,@0xDarth Go outside put the technology down. Take a walk get some fresh air.
82,@0xDarth I respect you admitting your mistake but you’re obviously going through something. You may have taken on more responsibility then you can handle as a mod but I would suggest taking a step back from this space in general. Get yourself right. The community didn’t need to see this

86,Drama all over the NFT space meanwhile Kongs are just waiting for the courts to be open so we can ball.
87,RT @Zeneca_33: My official reaction to the pudgy penguin drama. I'm too old for this. https://t.co/9E9ff2jpui
88,I don't know how to process the pudgy drama. To be offered .25 a week to be a mod on discord. Seems like a good gig to me. I can't sympathize with this.
