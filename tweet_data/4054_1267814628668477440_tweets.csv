82,@KikiElephants @koolranchgary @steel24 @CarlBoucherKnee @CandiceBergenMP Why is it selfish to not get the shot? The shot does not prevent infection and spread. Whether someone gets the shot doesnt affect you. Those that think otherwise are science deniers

90,"@KikiElephants @CarlBoucherKnee @CandiceBergenMP No, you are spreading misinformation.

2. This is a respritory virus which lives in all mammals. This means that even if the world vaxed at the same time it would still exist and mutate. It doesnt stop mutations."

93,"@nucks1212 @Brian64828937 @CarlBoucherKnee @CandiceBergenMP This is very new. 

Vaccines prevent infection and spread. The covid shot does not. So why the public mandate.

1. The jab doesnt prevent infection and spread. 

2. Viruses mutate regardless of the existence of the jab. 

3. Natural immunity shows to be more effective than the jab.
