 But like, why is this the game at all? I thought the commitment was to all inner circle members, not those with 3 or more"

29,"@Berwindigo @MeUndies @BoredApeYC For sure. Sucks. Personal responsibility for this sort of thing is definitely escalated with blockchain. I personally kind of like playing everything close to the vest in this way, but I can def understand why others would have reservations about it."
30,@Berwindigo @MeUndies @BoredApeYC Are there cases where scammers and influencers have acted in bad faith and taken advantage of buyers and artists? Sure. But there are also companies that have developed as a result of this tech that treat their communities and artists with respect. It's not all just one thing.
31,"@Berwindigo @MeUndies @BoredApeYC I think part of the problem with a lot of the discussion around NFTs is that people use weird, reductive generalizations like this. It's an evolving technology that hasn't been fully unlocked yet, and every project is distinct and building on from those that came earlier."

45,"@UnshinySnorlax @RutraZemog @PostingVoids @MeUndies @BoredApeYC Who’s argument do you think this is? You guys sure love to set up straw men huh.

My point is that innovative tech often develops while people underestimate its potential. Will that happen here? Maybe. All I know for sure is y’all seem very arrogant and generally pretty ignorant."
46,@callowGuru @MeUndies @BoredApeYC Who are you even talking to
47,"@callowGuru @MeUndies @BoredApeYC In fact your point about opensea is a great example of the shortsightedness I’m talking about. 

As if there will never be an alternative ever. Jfc"
48,"@callowGuru @MeUndies @BoredApeYC Agree that opensea’s dominance is stupid, but again that’s something that will change in time. There’s a good alternative already, and more in the works.

Your other ideas seem to miss the point. Congrats on your cocksuredness though seems cool."

69,@muircatburd @PostingVoids @MeUndies @BoredApeYC Future potential does carry value though. How long did it take Tesla to turn a profit? Were its investors struggling in the meantime? Did the company fail?
70,"@muircatburd @PostingVoids @MeUndies @BoredApeYC This wouldn't account for membership benefits that may be granted to those holding a token. 

Anyway once again, you're trying to debate things as they stand at the present, but the value of NFTs has barely even begun to take shape. We'll see what's what in five years."
71,@randomfrankp It's not just a picture. It's a collectable (with verifiable provenance) and also a membership token with benefits for an emerging web3 brand.
72,"@PostingVoids @MeUndies @BoredApeYC Didn't say they were the only possible objections--just common ones. And I'm seeing a lot of both under this tweet from myundies tbqh.

I guess he didn't need to overpay to make this true, but it does sorta emphasize the point."
76,"@PostingVoids @MeUndies @BoredApeYC Nobody is insisting on anything. And my point isn't to compare blockchain tech with with long distance communication directly, but to consider that innovative tech develops over time, and often while many people are too arrogant or too ignorant to see its potential."
