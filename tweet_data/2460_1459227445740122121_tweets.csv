9,OpenSea has a lot of shortcomings. The servers are often down. Critical code hasn’t been updated in years which causes a lot of wasted gas. Freezing and verification process is senseless. But it gets one major thing right. It flawlessly aggregates NFTs from absolutely everywhere.

17,"I honestly wish I could buy all my followers work, so much talent out there. Who knows maybe one day I will... Anything can happen in our beautiful world of NFT."
18,This NFT bull market is really separating the wheat from the chaff. The market is maturing. It's a great thing. Wagmi after all.
19,Advancements in AR technology will make the real world feel like a metaverse. Imagine being high on mind altering acid without negative side effects. This is why I made a big venture bet on digital fashion.
20,Buy low. Sell high. Get fucking rich.

23,Web3 NFT digital collectibles have already flippened the multi billion dollar physical collectibles industry
24,Feels like NFT money is shifting into collectibles projects that have community utility and tokenomics. Have fun with friends and get fucking rich. Pretty much the goal of most people in this community. And when they get rich they spend some on cool art. I think that’s the cycle.

30,"No doubt that we’re already interacting with the next big brands of our generation. NFT tech has disrupted collectibles because it turned it into a money game. Instant liquidity, DeFi economics, and provable scarcity are game changers. Collectibles are best use of the NFT medium."
31,I wonder when we’ll see the first major web3 acquisition? Something like MetaMask could be worth tens of billions to big tech as it’s already installed on pretty much every device of every crypto user. What’s this worth to a company like Facebook or Microsoft? Massive head start.
32,Money doesn’t motivate me. Being right motivates me. I’ll never play the VC circle jerk game. No matter how much money it costs me being left out of deals and really hated by some that wish I’d just play along in the pleb fleecing game. It isn’t me. I was raised better than that.
33,more chance for those who retweets all my tweets 😉
34,turn on 🔔 and retweet i will choose the winner within 1 day
35,Culture is the world's most valuable commodity. Blue chip NFT digital collectibles can handily do a 100x or even a 1000x from here. That doesn't mean that many will make that move. Hardly any will be relevant in a few years. But the ones that are will easily have 7 figure floors.
36,There’s gonna be a lot of web3 billionaires

44,Web3 is the great equalizer
45,"I’d be willing to bet that in El Salvador (and anywhere else in the world), USDT and Binance P2P is used infinitely more than BTC for real world transactions. Particularly crypto to fiat. All this happens on the Ethereum network (sort of). At least the USDT is issued on Ethereum."
46,Put in the work. Get fucking rich.
47,Royalties are the lifeblood of the creator economy. Web3 protocols like NFT trading swapping and lending that are built upon this economy need to integrate fair compensation for creators or we’re doomed as a movement. OpenSea is so popular and favored by creators because it pays.
48,Will 200 ETH change your life?
49,Collectible digital art is in its infancy. Market is a few years old. Was never possible before NFT technology. The physical art market has been around forever. It historically beat stock market. Digital wont be any different. Steady growth. But NFT utility is the momo moon play.

56,"Despite all the bugs, OpenSea still the best NFT marketplace by a mile. I think it will be hard for anybody to beat them. Even with top Sushi devs Shoyu hasn’t had good reviews. Something about OpenSea just clicks with users. I don’t see anybody beating them so easily. It’s true."
57,"It's funny seeing Crypto Twitter influencers that all aped NFTs at the top, and capitulated at the bottom, come in with the same outlandish claims they made a few years ago about NFTs being vaporware and headed to zero. Meanwhile they trade dog coins with a serious face. Bullish."
