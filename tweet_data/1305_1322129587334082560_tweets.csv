4,@GoslowEth @trial0r @doodles @poopie Love the idea of building on top of this tech to come up with racing games etc. and also for other projects to hop onboard this tech for their own narratives. Technically making space doodles a platform

6,"@trial0r @doodles I wonder if Space Doodles might be a separate collection on OS, where # of Doodles + # of Space(Doodles) = 10,000.

So, if your doodle is wrapped, it doesn't show up on the Doodles page but only on Space(Doodles) and vice-versa."

14,"To me the hurdle seems to be on-boarding the Indian population onto a web 3 platform which has the volume, bandwidth and functionality to scale applications that can lead to mass adoption, only then can we leapfrog the American incumbents if we had to."
15,"Almost every friend of mine knows of web 3 and NFTs, some believe in the value proposition of decentralisation and yet none have the purchasing ability of NFTs that basically are proponents of Web 3 today."
16,"In a country where the median “middle-class” salary is around $7500-$14000, how do you reach mass adoption of Web 3 technologies when most of the volume and activity occurs in Ethereum, which is ranging at $2700 as of this writing? 

Add to that 30% Capital gains tax on crypto"
17,"NFTs enable ownership to masses, which unlock shared goals, which leads to pockets of communities forming."
18,"Crypto =&gt; Centralised control on exchanges =&gt; Regulation =&gt; small steps

NFTs =&gt; Proof of ownership of art with social utility =&gt; Buyer’s Due Diligence as is with any commodity =&gt; big strides

This is how India will, or rather should, pioneer Web 3 imo"
19,"If India is to leapfrog American incumbents in Web 3, it must have a way to activate its ~ 900 million internet users.

NFTs embrace and allow control over culture, and in a country where independent artists find it hard to make ends meet, NFTs provide means of earning power"
20,"The term web 3 itself has gained mass traction over the past year and that is because of NFTs.

While a lot of big names in the space have made their way here from crypto, the market, as big as is it is today, has mostly come into existence because the laymen understood NFTs"
21,"India has a massive internet user base &amp; many great open protocols have come out of the country. There is no dearth of vision &amp; skill to pioneer a movement that is web 3. However, the key catalyst is the use of NFTs."
22,"Great time talking Web 3 in India
@balajis , @arunsdevine @shastry, @ashish343 , @Tushar307 

However, was hoping to hear more on #NFTs.
To me, Web 3 is all about decentralised communities having the autonomy to run social organisations through shared ownership 🧵 https://t.co/xS4ZRikI9Z"

Jokes aside, Technical breakthroughs rarely price into what consumers are willing to pay. However, this is an interesting play - do you think we’ll see 20E first few weeks of March?"

We all got distracted, while some cheered for a public companies ad.

50,"@benmayorwhite @adidas Ben, you're such an inspiration for us who have a full-time job, not just wrt. to web 3, but around driving organizational mindset change. You were also one of the first people I noticed using their ape on LinkedIn, and that was even before the Adidas drop.
