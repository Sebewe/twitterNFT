0,@ALCrego_ It’s truly my pleasure and I think you’re dead on accurate on art v products.
1,"@ALCrego_ I think your courage to share your thoughts is admirable. Our reactions are secondary, but to react and not engage is a missed opportunity for us both to grow by learning how others see the world around them. ❤️"
2,"@ALCrego_ Perhaps it’s more a reaction to what I felt was a growing theme over time…perhaps it’s just lost in translation. Either way, I appreciate your perspectives, often fascinating. I may have just been reading into it incorrectly."
3,"@ALCrego_ It’s hard to ignore what seems like some latent contempt you hold for “collectors”…as one of yours, I’d hope you see us in a better light. 🤷‍♂️"
4,"@beaniemaxi @mdudas The “ideology” is decentralization, not connecting with your MM."
5,@Paddy_Stash @garyvee @MuratAdamovMZT @arcade_nfts @MyCurioCards I’m convinced @garyvee is filling a shadow wallet or two with arcades before he gets on board publicly…the historical drip is too strong to resist. 🤫🤣

18,"@beaniemaxi IMO, adding clarity that these are past accomplishments, you have no current role with PV would have been sufficient. Adding “Previously: Co-creator of Punks…” It’s fair to claim what you’ve contributed, but it’s clear they don’t want the implication you’re still involved."
