25,"@theanongamedev @gregisenberg Who said I had to trade the asset to another game? I am saying I own a skin I should be able to buy sell it with other users. 

Centralisation and the monopoly is the norm today. It won’t be tomorrow."
26,"@theanongamedev @gregisenberg The gaming company still exists and has ownership of the IP. 

The idea is to work together with the users, give them power over their assets and thousands of hours spent. 

If you own an asset you can trade it. Fortnite won’t let you sell skins or accounts. It’s insane imo."
27,"@schmaezzle @Kizzudoramu @GamingAngelGabe @unicodemonkey It’s call change. 

Yes since 1970 now we are at 2022.

Adapt or die. That will happen with gaming companies that won’t change and give more power back to their users."
28,"@schmaezzle @Kizzudoramu @GamingAngelGabe @unicodemonkey The IP of the game would be of the gaming company. 

IP or X limited rights of an item could be given to the user what’s the issue there. More user generated content will eventually be more beneficial for the gaming company. Bringing in more users and more subscribers."
29,@avi900_eth Great news 💪💪 Positive thoughts from Argentina.
30,"@schmaezzle @Kizzudoramu @GamingAngelGabe @unicodemonkey There are NFTs that are 100% stored in the blockchain. Yes there are others that point to a decentralised storing system. 

Also there are NFTs that are giving full IP rights and commercial rights to the users."
31,"@StigFostervold That’s why I am saying it should be play to own and not play to earn. You play games to have fun and be part of a community. 

You spends thousands of hours you should at least be the true owner of your character and in game assets. 

Once you own your assets you can trade them."
32,@GamingAngelGabe @gregisenberg Metaverse.
33,@schmaezzle @Kizzudoramu @GamingAngelGabe @unicodemonkey For example a comic that was discontinued and you have it. This items are valuable in real life the same goes for the digital assets.
34,"@schmaezzle @Kizzudoramu @GamingAngelGabe @unicodemonkey You know nothing about crypto, NFTs, web3 clearly. 

You can have an NFT that will be verified in Twitter for example and just flex the asset you had in the game. 

Flexing digital assets is an utility. You are the sole owner of X item that Blizzard made once and deleted."
35,"@Kizzudoramu @GamingAngelGabe @schmaezzle @unicodemonkey Nobody is going to play a game where you buy an asset that it’s then arbitrary deleted

Yes it’s a centralised entity that can do whatever they want. Usually killing up a lot of games with their poor decision making. 

You would still have the NFT. Even if you can’t use it."
36,@DeerTrivia @unicodemonkey @schmaezzle @GamingAngelGabe I believe in a shared ownership of the game or part of the decisions and future of the game.
37,"@Kizzudoramu @GamingAngelGabe @schmaezzle @unicodemonkey Crypto lets the in game assets to be traded freely. 
Crypto lets direct funding to the proposals the game company can make. 

The importance here is giving the ownership of the assets to the gamers. You can't sell skins in Fornite and you can't sell your accounts. Its ludicrous."
38,"@schmaezzle @unicodemonkey @GamingAngelGabe How to not give any argument and have a proper conversation. 
#ngmi"
39,"@GamingAngelGabe @schmaezzle @unicodemonkey Why can't the gaming company make proposals that they can put in the product pipeline and let the community decide and/or fund via crypto?

Hey lets make this update. It cost X MM USD and 12 months. You will get an NFT that says that you funded this and will get a X badge."
40,"@DeerTrivia @unicodemonkey @schmaezzle @GamingAngelGabe It can be managed by the Product team of the game developer. You can use discord to have a direct communication with your community. 

There very little communication nowadays from companies to their users."
41,"@schmaezzle @unicodemonkey @GamingAngelGabe As a gamer I can vote to make an upgrade to the game and the same community that spends 50 USD or more to buy the game and spends money on a subscription. 

Could decide to fund the initiative directly to the gaming company through crypto and get an NFT as recognition for example"
42,"@mlcandelario It's coming. Shared ownership. 

No users no game. 

No ownership of assets no future of gaming."
43,@mlcandelario Why not?
44,@unicodemonkey @schmaezzle @GamingAngelGabe The community could fund it through NFTs or crypto directly to the developers of the game.
45,"Probably nothing. 

Just jpegs being bought with credit cards... https://t.co/enK2u9BAch"
46,"@gregisenberg It should be Play to Own. You spend time in a game and you own your assets. 

Not only that, the community should also have ownership of the game and decision making ability as they are the users.

Finally, when you own assets you will be able to earn as you can trade them freely"
