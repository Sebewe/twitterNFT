6,"@b0neMp3_eth @3landersNFT We are the dreamers, keep at it and I’m sure you’ll get whatever you’re after and then some."
7,"@HotShotGems @3landersNFT Agreed, I sold some losses recently too. This seems like an obvious play. We shall see what happens next. Either way I’m here for it"
8,@Stef_Vas_Ax_Su @3landersNFT Thank you thank you! Dream on.
9,"@HotShotGems @3landersNFT Definitely, I need to start adding to the squad."

17,@SeeDarkk I think you're going to be fine but I've got the same bags lol so I may be biased.
18,"@antfex @3landersNFT ""I think I've made a mistake, I should delist."" lol happens every time."
19,@bobvancecrypto @TheMauiWowi @3landersNFT Same. Hopefully they under promise during the campfire and over deliver. Love that this momentum has all been on art and community so far.
20,You ever buy a NFT with the mindset that you’re going to flip it but then you get attached to it and don’t? @3landersNFT #3L4L #3landersNFT https://t.co/ZCSdkxwOSl
21,@bobvancecrypto @TheMauiWowi @3landersNFT Love em. Having a hard time listing any that I originally had planned on flipping lol https://t.co/e7XnDWWYoA
22,@BrownThom Maybe apples to oranges right? 2D to 3D. I don’t disagree but maybe not exactly the same plane or dimension ✨

34,@bk5442 @wenmilk_eth @coolcatsnft Honestly hoping there’s some kind of special 1 year holder airdrop for people.

36,@0xinc I'm willing to endure the pain to support anything innovative in this space. I'm overexposed to cc and need to adjust a bit but overall I'm still long cats. How many 50% corrections have long term cat holders endured so far?

38,Where my rabbit frenz at? @Deadfellaz #deadfrenz https://t.co/6VGu9mRapL
39,ETH is gonna be down to double digits by the time these MNLTHs reveal.
40,@WriterNft @3landersNFT just checked it's a .5% trait 🔥 I like these too much too sell haha that's a problem.
41,@smwise55 @Deadfellaz I got a rabbit 🐰
42,@WriterNft @3landersNFT I think it’s a 2% trait so not super rare or anything but kind of funny.
43,@shoopywoopyy @DekOCryptic81 @3landersNFT Nice!

48,"Looks like @3landersNFT down a little bit to 1.4 from 1.8. I'm super excited to see how these all turn out during the reveal tomorrow morning. Loving the sneak peaks they've put out. 

You buying? Holding? Flipping? Or just watching?"
49,@AEO yo what?! the one day I pull up AE's site just to see what they got and they give us a gm. Feels like inception or something.
50,@naveed_q @YourFinanc3 @PUMA @coolcatsnft Puma looks good on you https://t.co/7zN5cTPKO0
51,@SoFly_eth I think I may switch up my strategy and limit how long I hold a majority of my NFTs. Being liquid enough to buy a handful of these new projects around mint and sell pre reveal seems like the move
52,Hope some of you mfers take some profit. gm.
53,@ConnNFT Just need to read the message and ensure that there’s a listing price. I got the same message but didn’t have any issues with selling and creating new listings. OS has always used that contract I’m pretty sure.

70,@ConnNFT Have you checked out Pokt network for decentralized blockchain nodes? https://t.co/PFZTOXzZDP. Seems like a lot of new projects and platforms will need reliable blockchain nodes.

84,Ha this must be why ETH is actually working as intended. Remind me about this tweet next time it's broke. https://t.co/H21YQWZt09
85,You ever send ETH from your CEX to your wallet and the transaction confirms in less than a minute? Makes me so bullish on the future of this ecosystem.
86,@MCM0NEY Probably will happen organically once the game gets moving and people want more $MILK for their pets. I know I was looking to sell a cat on the floor earlier to pick up more pets.
87,@FuZzyy_14 This is sick
88,I’m not expecting cool pets to dip below 2 eth tomorrow after public sale. 1500/20000 is 7.5% of supply and I’d imagine some people may hodl on to them. Supply shock likely incoming. #wltc #coolpets

98,@wenmilk_eth @coolcatsnft This cat was such a good pick up. Was tempted.
