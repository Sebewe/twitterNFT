8,"@SuperN_Nerd @d_mon @NFTLlama @Pixelmon @Syberer If you think that NFTs and Blockchain technology is going to be perfect / energy efficient overnight, then you definitely do not understand the technology behind a Blockchain and how technology actually works."
9,@SuperN_Nerd @d_mon @NFTLlama @Pixelmon @Syberer Proof of ownership holds not value? Screenshot my monkey picture and go sell it then.
10,"@SuperN_Nerd @d_mon @NFTLlama @Pixelmon @Syberer You clearly haven't done enough research to understand the potential future of NFTs / the technology behind them, which I have done and that is why I support NFT projects."
11,@d_mon @NFTLlama @Pixelmon @Syberer Definitely agree that some people would have little motivation after making $70m. I'm happy that they're going to try resolve the mistakes they made. We shall see though haha

13,@d_mon @NFTLlama @Pixelmon @Syberer No lol. I have morals and like creating projects / innovating. These guys can easily fix the mistakes they made if they choose to do so is what I was trying to say in my previous reply.
14,"@NFTLlama @Pixelmon @Syberer They did raise $70m though, so they should have the funding required to execute the game correctly with a structured team. Dude definitely messed up, however, there's no way they can't develop the full game with more devs and more development time, with the budget they have."
