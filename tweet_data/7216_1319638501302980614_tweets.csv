72,"@farokh @CryptoMories @opensea It's really not OpenSea's fault. They are legally obligated to remove the content until the mories file a counter-notice. 

Here's a thread explaining the DMCA process:

76,"For those interested, here are some links explaining the issues with DMCA and capturing some overreach issues that have come up:

https://t.co/SGKO2KPojT"
77,"Obligatory disclaimer: These are only my thoughts, not financial or legal advice. I'm just a jpeg enthusiast, not a lawyer."
78,"These takedowns also put these projects in a rough position because standard legal advice is to never discuss pending issues publicly, regardless if they are infringing or not. This inevitably causes damage, especially when people are misinformed as to what a DMCA notice means."
79,"Projects like SJ and others who are attempting to create communities in web3 that empower creators over industries will always be a target of attack from industry giants that are quick to file claims, taking advantage of the DMCA's broad reach, overextending their IP rights."
80,"Shonen Junk's aim is to reimagine anime in web3 by empowering fans, artists, and creators by creating a platform where everyone can be properly recognized for what they bring to the table, rather than the current Top-Down approach of anime/manga creation. 
https://t.co/2OU3lbNqVG https://t.co/H2ou3efKle"
81,"cause a lot more damage. @CryptoMories has done a great job reassuring its community, but I feel this issue is even more prevalent for projects like @shonenjunkNFT who are attempting to reimagine an entire multi-media industry in web3:"
82,"without examination and sometimes without any basis. In fact, notices can be intentionally filed by bad actors without merit. This happens more often than you'd think. Protecting copyrights is important. But when it comes to projects in web3, false takedowns have the potential to"
83,"content immediately in response to ANY DMCA notice. The content is then taken down without evaluating the claim for accuracy, or considering the defense of fair use. The major controversy lies in how this allows the DMCA to become a vehicle for abuse, having content taken down"
84,"The DMCA is actually extremely important and how we are able to have services like YouTube, Twitter, and even OpenSea because it protects these platforms from liability. In return for this, the DMCA demands that for the privilege of hosting content, these platforms take down"
85,"In turn, projects like @CryptoMories and @shonenjunkNFT suffer from FUD and panic over the collections being removed. 

How is this possible? Well let's look into exactly what the DMCA does."
86,"Initially intending to protect IP rights, the DMCA is not just used against ""pirates"" but also against consumers and creators. It has become an easy way for industry giants and competitors to generate more $$ and remove legitimate competition by filing questionable DMCA claims."
87,"The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a law enacted by the United States Congress in 1998 initially created to protect all forms of media: music, writing, art, photography, etc. DMCA controversies are a tale as old as the internet and have been very prevalent in web2."
88,"Welcome to all my new followers! Due to the positive feedback of my Space explaining the takedown of @CryptoMories, I decided to also write out an in-depth explanation.

DMCA: 
Explaining what it is, how it works, and how it can be abused in Web2 and Web3.
