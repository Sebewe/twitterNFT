21,"@panyero96 @doopleth @LooksRareNFT @opensea multiple offers is great, but as soon as 1 offer is accepted, the others should disappear automatically. Cant be too hard?  The warning is great but its pretty disappointing if you accept an offer and its no offer anymore ;-)"
22,"@panyero96 @doopleth @LooksRareNFT @opensea thought it would be the other way around, but seems like thats the case. still think this shouldnt be a thing at all though. If you make an offer, you should put the money on the table and keep it there until you pull it back or it gets accepted."
23,"@doopleth @LooksRareNFT @opensea ah okay, didnt know that, never accepted an offer before. Seems all wrong..."
24,"I really like @LooksRareNFT but is this something that happens on @opensea as well?

I think that should not be a thing. Offers should be deleted as soon as the potential buyer doesnt have enough WETH in his wallet anymore. https://t.co/uClUkWpKxl"
