1,@DefiBanker But the individuals giving up their identity to get on those sites basically sign up for that. I have trouble blaming the exchanges.
2,@DefiBanker Why? Isn’t this to be expected on sites requiring KYC?

12,"@magnoliamegan_ A lot of web3 right now is Mfers sitting around on their computer shitposting as numbers go up and down. That’s the meme, the vibe. It’s a perfect CT/NFT identity and has a creator that is broadly liked and good at maintaining relevance."

16,"@Wades_ETH @NedRyersonBing If the secondary also went directly to charity would be less of an issue.

78,"@daniel100eth @metaMori_eth @LogueMonster @KeepinItGutta I see you getting hate for this, but this a fair assessment. They haven’t delivered a ton that’s unique from other projects but have promised more. I don’t think utility correlates with floor price in NFTs, at least not yet, so it doesn’t matter and isn’t FUD to say so."
