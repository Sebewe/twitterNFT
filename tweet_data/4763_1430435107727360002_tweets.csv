4,"@whatdotcd i’m a big fan of fwb for what it’s worth, no shade intended — i just think that investors should buy directly on the market regardless of their status"
5,@whatdotcd i would call that a discount
6,"@whatdotcd which part is inaccurate? they may have bought at a “premium” over the price at that specific point in time, but had they invested on the open market instead of a private deal with the community, they would have likely paid more for their investment as prices increased"
7,"i would love to be proven wrong — lmk why you feel otherwise, or if there are networks that you’ve found that have avoided heavy influence from institutional investors 👇"
8,"@jack’s point is that despite platforms’ best efforts, money in hand is power and VCs are the best equipped (and most motivated) to use that power to ensure that they remain in control and on top"
9,"instead, they wined and dined key community members and put up a proposal to buy tokens (from the community) at a discount from the market rate"
10,"an example of this is a16z’s investment in @FWBtweets — they could have bought the token directly on the market, providing liquidity and rewarding early users who took on the most risk"
11,"sometimes, they even negotiate buying in at a discount, even though with crypto they have the ability to invest on the open market alongside retail investors"
12,"many “decentralized” protocols take significant amounts of VC money in their early days, granting those investors inappropriate amounts of control in the network"
13,"sadly, have to agree with @jack here — while some protocols have successfully achieved true decentralization, they are the exception (at the moment) https://t.co/Kb7PV6feKR"
