It very well could have been a custom written one by my church I grew up in.

The organist was a Berkeley Dr. and seriously brilliant. Wouldn’t doubt it if he made a custom Kyrie…

He was known for his pre-service freestyles where he’d medley the hymns of the day."
24,"@Hallowedfoxmoon There is an especially unique one where the last word of the minister’s prayer (lord) and the congregation part overlap.

Just a rolling prayer of song.

“In peace, in peace let us pray to the…LORD HAVE MERCY, CHRIST HAVE MERCY, LORD HAVE MER-CY…”"

53,"@arkadidp With these Microsoft / Sony acquisitions of major gaming brands/organizations - I think we are closer than ever to this being some sort of reality.

Maybe not on blockchain *yet* but for sure a unified profile across major gaming franchises and brands."
54,"@arkadidp For now, that is the case.

In my mind - having a unified wallet where I can actually own my character's skin and use it across different systems/platforms/profile pics would be dope.

And all of those pointing back and verifying ownership of the flex."
55,"@arkadidp That is where the world can open up.

Imagine buying a branded ""skin"" that YOU enjoy and being able to use it across multiple games."
56,@arkadidp Even more verifiable proof of ownership and origin of the skin.
57,"CS:GO was ahead of it’s time with the marketplace and being able to buy, sell, trade, and sign skins. And to verify ownership of skins.

It’s time for another CS:GO caliber game to introduce this same concept but on the blockchain.

🚀"
58,"Hot take:

Gamers should be the last people scoffing at NFTs and crypto.

We buy currency and skins in nearly every game we play.

Now, just imagine the potential of making money on those skins - and not just having them for a flex. (But flexing is still ok)

Same concept here."
