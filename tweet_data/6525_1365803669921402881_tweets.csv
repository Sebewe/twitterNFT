26,There’s a natural pulse within music. Because it is energy itself. Even with 1 instrument or voice. It’s undeniable
27,Vulnerability is a super power. There’s no reason to be scared.
28,"@JohnMarvinScott 😂😂 that’s the trick to using all the song parts w no direction. Just make them bridges. Bridged can whatever, no one will know lol"

39,@timriopelle i feel this yes.. its cognitive dissonance. two known realities are clashing together pretty violently rn
40,"@nandanadim @nekosmother i love poetry, I do lyric writing too, so I'm always down the literature rabbit hole~ 

And I totally agree w/ you. Why bind yourself to the rules of this reality, when you already are here? It seems more fun to break those rules and create new ones from a different world."

42,"@imamandafrances example, what are the goals of the artist for their music? is it placements? sync deals? providing audio assets for video games? Providing assets for other web3 infrastructures. Music serves so much more purpose than just the artist-to-fan relationship.

It means much more in w3."
43,"@imamandafrances the play for music NFTs is to figure out what market the artist is targeting and the niche of their music. Royalties etc.. are BS ""utilities"" that are tossed-in because artists don't know what else to add. 

All you need is yourself, conviction, and make to create great art."

46,"@sgt_sl8termelon You need a certain number of items to achieve enough liquidity to entice owners to trade w one another. 

I realized this a couple months ago, and that’s the primary reason. There’s not enough liquidity in a 5 piece collection. 

You’re definitely right."
47,@nandanadim @nekosmother That’s why I love writing fantasy music bcuz f all else 🥲
48,"With every new song I write, I discover more tools and ideas for future songs. 

It’s a progression over time. Music and art in general takes years to acquire a publicly displayable skill level."
49,"Seeing projects like pixelmon get big and then just drop the nuts on a reveal means the NFT space needs more LEGITIMATE founders with skills. 

Artists, please dont  let imposter syndrome stop you, nothing is fucking real anyway."
