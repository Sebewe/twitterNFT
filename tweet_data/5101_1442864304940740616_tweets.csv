V2 are  originals - the crypto punks 
V2 will own the IP &amp; rights in future. I m certain about it 

V1 r the first NFTs, even with glitch it makes them extremely rare desirable.
V1 are part of history

29,"3/3

My advise to $looks or @LooksRareNFT 

a. Need to improve user experience a little bit.
OS is ahead in User Design and ease.

If you do that, Looksrare could be where Opensea is at the moment. 

Note: I hold a 6 figure Looks in multiple wallet.

#NFA"
30,"2/3

I consider $Looks as safe investment. Here is why
a. Driven by NFT market( growing day by day)
b. Competition valued at $13 billion
c. Opensea have lots of issues lately
d. $Looks is growing and is being integrated in lot of tools"
31,"A short thread on $Looks as investment.

a. I have staked around 19000 ( on this wallet )

Around 30 eth 

Rewards collected 1958 ( Looks ) x 4.2 = 8223.6$
Rewards collected WETH 3.9 x 2500 = 9750
