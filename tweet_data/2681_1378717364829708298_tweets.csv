1,@lobot3po @thingdoms I wish I could buy more. I NEED MORE THINGS 😭
2,@DiscoverXnft You’re a meme whale
3,RT @ManaMoonNFT: reached out to this guy since I was a 3 eth Pixelmon minter. he didn't even know that the art was for NFTs and doesn't end…
4,@DiscoverXnft @NFTmachine @jakethedegen Then just go buy a Mac 🤦🏻‍♂️
5,@thingdoms So what you’re saying is that you are going to do a stealth mint…I got you https://t.co/zjRVecjklS
6,@citizen1729 So do I just need to buy an s2 identity or do I need more?
7,@bobvancecrypto Ngl minivans go hard. The Chryslers drive really nice and are pretty luxurious.
8,@RegisterArtist It’s gonna be so cool to look back in 10+ years and see where all your artwork has gone all over the world.
9,@DiscoverXnft You talking about @elonmusk
10,I want more @thingdoms
11,@Bi0HapHazard Who’s doing this?
12,"So how do we do know that BAYC isn’t just paying celebrities to buy and advertise them? That’s what celebrities do all the time, right. You think these people really care about NFTs?"
13,@FussCheatham @thingdoms Do it now or forever regret it. 🤷🏻‍♂️
14,Buying a NFT for 10 ETH pre-reveal: https://t.co/hHKzGGtEBo
15,@DiscoverXnft GMI
16,When will @opensea fix their “ctrl + z” function?
17,Why does @Neckville look like a derivative of a derivative? @DerivativeApes
18,@evdawg_eth @Pul3eNFT Just minted 2 of these. Looks awesome!
19,@WomenTribe_nfts is 🔥🔥🔥. Snagged these 3 off the floor after selling my rare for 2.5 ETH. https://t.co/LpQ0Eay5z9
20,@yungprofittaker https://t.co/uo0cyMByJH
21,"@yungprofittaker If you’re at GC atleast pick up something better than a squier, cmon."
22,@dolores_steffen @WomenTribe_nfts 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/ZRgMNwhMIk
23,@WomenTribe_nfts is 🔥. Sold my rare at 2.5 ETH and then immediately snagged these 3 from the floor. https://t.co/iaz6xPiCg5
24,@dubz0922 I’d be surprised if this gets anywhere. Their ToS basically say their not liable for anything…
25,@FalconeEth @WomenTribe_nfts Yeah I already have a 1.25 offer and I bought at 0.26. I think I just take it and snag a floor at 0.25.
26,Got in right before reveal and managed to snag a rare @WomenTribe_nfts. Do I flip or HODL? https://t.co/TwUyQGxSYK
27,"@themonarch00 Lazy Lions at 0.17 ETH.

WoW at 0.3 ETH."
28,@parabholic The downside of the collection offers though is that almost every time you try to accept an offer it’s no longer valid. That seems to still be a work in process.
29,What does LooksRare do better than OS? (Excluding their token from the conversation completely).
30,I wonder when people will wake up and realize business isn't based on positivity and good vibes. In this space those phrases tend to be wrapped around malicious activity. PSA: The NFT space isn't a safe place.
31,RT @bobvancecrypto: X2Y2 &gt; Looksrare
32,@PuffYatty It was already hanging on by a thread
33,@DiscoverXnft What’s an NFT?
34,@spinketh @NathanHeadPhoto Wow. It’s April 14 in the US
35,@spinketh @NathanHeadPhoto 10 days? Where are you located?
36,@ApeStackin @NathanHeadPhoto That’s an option but each collection has to meet their criteria and apparently all the stuff I want to sell doesn’t meet it. So I have 40+ items listed from numerous collections and still can’t claim my airdrop… smh.
37,@DiscoverXnft What bothers me is the amount of people that just wanna hear their voice and take up time offering no value. Something that is well informed and knowledgeable would be nice. Less opinion based blabber. Not saying don’t share opinion but that’s the majority of what spaces is.
38,@liambakers The longer something is hyped in this space the more ludicrous the expectations become. It’s starting to become fantasy land around here.
39,@julia_nfts I can’t cause I don’t have anything I want to sell that qualifies… smh. Did buy the token and stake though.
40,PSA to the next company that does an airdrop. All eyes are on you and you will experience “more activity than you expected”. Just by not screwing it up you have an upper hand on the competition.
41,@the_x2y2 had the right ideas but this is turning into a disaster very quickly.
42,@DiscoverXnft $Looks like your holding a big bag of copium
43,"RT @punk3178: I'm really getting sick of the grifters in this space- If you really want to buidl- do it and stfu
and maybe we should stop f…"
44,@bobvancecrypto @Coinbase_NFT I’ll send you the proper burn address.
45,RT @MobiusStripTF: Friendly reminder that no one owes you anything.
46,"@TheShamdoo @the_x2y2 Shamdoo: “I don’t care about you’re platform, I just want free money from you.”

The idiocracy of this space is incredible"
47,"@0xBender People in this space live in a fantasy world most of the time. Web3 is still run by humans, the same behavior from other markets will be here. Some will win big and many will lose."
48,The way people are acting about this @the_x2y2 airdrop is honestly getting pathetic. People are fudding a platform purely because they can’t get free money from them yet.
49,"@Sh0ckw4vePuls4r @the_x2y2 You can buy on uniswap, if you’re out then it’s your own choice."
50,@Marc_George_NFT @DeezNutzNFT Hear you loud and clear. https://t.co/WQfQ3zZfOB
51,@DiscoverXnft Current state: https://t.co/d4tdHTq8sr
52,@OsamuKisho We saw it happen once with $looks and they have a strong whitepaper so I’m just hoping to see a similar play out.
53,@OsamuKisho For sure I’ve already nearly doubled the amount I bought. I’ll see how things play out at claim. By then I will have accumulated another 1500 probably. Will most likely take my initial investment out and let the rest ride.
54,"$X2Y2 staking rewards is down from 11,000% APR to now 9,300% APR. I think it’s time to sell."
55,"@ell_afc Yes, when it opens again. It’s down at the moment."
56,I like everything about @the_x2y2 except for the name. Who decided that was a good idea?
57,"#NewNFTProfilePic NFT by thingdoms

It’s a @thingdoms kind of day https://t.co/VvhgX22ncm"
58,@vakkuda Yeah I haven’t claimed mine yet. Not sure when it will reopen.
59,@KingBlackBored DEX
60,"Bought just under 3000 $X2Y2 at $1.80  and have been staking around 12 hours now and have already accumulated about 500 (~$1,500). Trading around $3 right now. I could see this doing the same price action as $LOOKS hitting $5-7. I think they have a better platform than LR &amp; OS."
61,@0x_fxnction Nice to see some whales whining about an airdrop 😂
62,Stay Thingy my frens. @thingdoms https://t.co/XWTSdyIC2Y
63,@bobvancecrypto @the_x2y2 Waiting for them to unpause it. I really like it so far. The platform is clean and very easy to use. They fixed a lot of small things that LR and Os have neglected. It’s good to have more competition.
64,I love seeing #Airdrop trending.
65,Lets be honest we're not that disappointed in @Coinbase_NFT. We were never going to use their platform we just want them to pump our bags.
66,$Looks at how simple @the_x2y2 made approving and revoking when listing your items. https://t.co/J0g9xGb6IH
67,@Warlock89765157 @the_x2y2 And making you transfer listings from OS is a great move to get organic volume and users to engage. They made it very simple to do as well.
68,I've been on @the_x2y2 for like 20 minutes and I already love it more than OS and LR. This could be a winner.
69,"Anybody know about this @LILBTHEBASEDGOD airdrop? Is it legit and/or safe?

https://t.co/pzmUvalo2o

* I now nothing about it and can not recommend claiming, DYOR."
70,$Looks like another good reason to stop using @opensea https://t.co/fBT8yDt62F
71,@AmericanExpress got jokes today https://t.co/p0060RdJB2
72,I think early January was when we were supposed to liquidate. I’ve got a bad feeling.
73,Coinbase is about to be the biggest partner for rugpulls. @Coinbase_NFT please hire someone that is in NFT space and understands what is happening in the community.
74,@wilxlee Everything is a red flag 🚩
75,"PSA: Don’t trust anybody, DYOR. Trust me."
76,@TwinkleTeeToes He’s a keeper
77,"RT @JRNYcrypto: 💜 GIVEAWAY TIME 💜

78,"@Warlock89765157 For you, I’ll be generous and pay ya 0.069 ETH and I’ll even cover the gas!"
79,@Sean55352532 Why is that? I don’t know anything about nodes.
80,@ap3father https://t.co/PDqcJ17Ip0
81,@TheFranswah @garyvee Let us know what he tells you to buy. 🤝
82,I see nodes are becoming a thing. Who thinks they’ve got the best one to invest in?
83,I guess it’s almost over… https://t.co/6YO5fb3pEP

86,@SpaceGrouper We’re just the ones providing value for others.
87,@TwinkleTeeToes 0.069 ETH?
88,"I guess you could say that their ""dumb"" commercial did its job. https://t.co/KTHgwz6I1b"
89,Trying to find new ways to add value to the community. Decided I'd be very generous. I will buy your seed phrase for 0.05 ETH.
90,@thingdoms How about this fellow? https://t.co/ZJrN9JqaKI
91,@its_JustLos https://t.co/W6lDSECch5
92,Bought more $LOOKS we'll probably see $1 tonight...
93,@AAfterhourz That's just the tip of the iceberg unfortunately. I'm too embarrassed to keep going.
94,@AAfterhourz I don’t remember why. It was when it first came out and I had no idea what I was doing. I sold Lazy Lions at 0.17 ETH 😭
95,Going back and looking at my early nft plays is very painful. I bought WoW at 0.15 ETH... and sold for 0.3 ETH. 💀
96,"@EverydayJohn_ Just found mine, apparently i sold it $2.94 😂"
97,@EverydayJohn_ I got one of these somewhere.
98,Can we just go back to forum pages?
99,"@FrOHzD @LooksRareNFT OS is the most user friendly and it doesn’t matter how good or bad your platform is people are naturally attracted to what looks clean and is easy to navigate. I struggle with LR, it doesn’t feel polished. The fundamentals are astronomically better tho."
