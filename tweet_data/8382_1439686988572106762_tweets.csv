13,"@HarpaRon @beaniemaxi True !! And booo UNC, go Duke !!"
14,@HarpaRon @beaniemaxi Marketing is critical to selling out a project. Unfortunately the focus in the space has gone almost entirely towards the marketing and not the tech. I think this is mostly due to the average consumer. Most NFTers would rather walk on hot coals than read a white paper.
15,"Even if you dislike @beaniemaxi, he’s 1000% correct. Most of the influencers in this space couldn’t hack together a project even if they ripped all the code off of GitHub. The baffling lack of knowledge of tech from the “top” of this space is unlike any other I’ve been in. https://t.co/vtG6Nvrttr"

35,@wafudraws @doodles I'm not saying they pioneered the color palette. I'm saying that they are one of the first/pioneering projects to combine the artistic style/colors/characteristics that we see in so many projects coming out today.
36,"@cory_eth @doodles Makes sense, my keen sense of observation is one of my top strengths. It's only really surpassed by my sense of smell."

39,"Bullish af on @doodles for the pure reason that it seems like every project coming out today uses the same line art + pastel combo that they ""pioneered"". Not naming names (and a lot of them look SUPER cool), but anyone else noticing this?"
