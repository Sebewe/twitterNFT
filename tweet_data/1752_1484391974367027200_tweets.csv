23,"@Reuben_Wu @LooksRareNFT Hey guys, I'd like to put the Vanishing for sale on LR but the collection is not setup there and if it sells, I'd like to make sure Reuben receives his royalty fees."
24,@LooksRareNFT You need to partner with a few big collections to really list and launch their collections on LR.  Need more volume.

61,"@boredape93 I agree, but I expect providers to protect my info and explain to me when and how it is compromised."
62,@boredape93 Not entirely. Someone gained access to the email addresses stored in OS.  Plenty of tech solutions to prevent that.
63,@cryptoclawd22 @sartoshi_nft And a massive wall at 6.9… 🤣🤣🤣
64,@hopaness_romtic @opensea Nope - I used a specific email address just for OS.
65,How can anyone claim it’s safe to use @opensea when they have not explained how our emails in their systems were obtained?  What am I missing?
66,@opensea You keep diverting the issue.  Please explain how they got the emails that were in your system.
67,@nss_eth How did they get the emails?
68,@SpaceCityMutant @LooksRareNFT I’m pretty sure the trait sniper extension now works on LR.

73,So how did the Phishers get email addresses that were ONLY setup for OS? @opensea (I did receive the email but never clicked on it)
74,"@nader_razzaq I didn't click, but how did they get the email addresses that were ONLY given to OS?  (Yes, I setup a separate one just for OS)."
75,"@ape7458 I agree, and I guess that's my take.  We all have a responsibility to make Web 3 successful. And that's why I'm supporting Web 3 vs. W2 Cos despite their imperfections. LR is doing better, still work to do, but I'm going to give them a chance because it benefits us all."
76,"@ape7458 It's a good debate and I appreciate it.  The Pros would be that there are more buyers (demand) on OS which make our assets more liquid and support other chains.  But I like the thought of a real Web 3.0 Co in LR.  Full transparency, I am still in it so I do have a bias."
77,@ape7458 I may have forgotten to include the lower fees (I assume we're all clear on that)
78,"@ape7458 Counter argument:  It was (and still is) beta, improving daily and communicates clearly.  Gives you both rewards (which may or may not be useless) and distribute WETH (which has fairly provable value)."
79,@ape7458 Ok - When has LR not not worked?  And was the pump and dump done by external or internal teams?
80,"@ape7458 Ok, I’ll bite.  Pros and cons of OS vs. LR?"
81,"@K3n_eth No idea, I’m done with both tbh.  Revoking all.  Neither have the right vide to begin with."

84,"So seriously, would love to hear the #YellowArmy’s take on the @NFTCryptoChicks situation… One has a horrified community about possible plagiarism, the other is proud of stealing openly.  What say you @0xApes_NFT ?"
85,@pilotshannonh GM
86,"3/3
There is no playbook for this in this new space and I hope the community comes together to work constructively on these answers and continue to grow this NFT space.  I certainly don’t have the answers.  
PS - I currently own 5 CCs."
87,"2/3 
4) Does selling the art provide fees that would go to the plagiarist?  
5) What happens to the community?
6) How do you make it right for the OG artist? 
7) How do some get away with open plagiarism like @0xApes_NFT"
88,"Trying to process a number of thoughts about the @NFTCryptoChicks situation: 🧵1/3
1) Plagiarism is unacceptable, period.  
2) Is the community a victim as much as the original artist?
3) Is keeping the art condoning plagiarism?"
89,@OxJB_nft @NFTCryptoChicks Shit - Disappointing.  Pointless for me to sell now.  Let’s see how it evolves. I hope they bring the OG artist onboard.
