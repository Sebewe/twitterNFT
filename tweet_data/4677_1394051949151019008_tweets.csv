4,@Laurel_Bore @LooksRareNFT It's a great buy if you think they will get more usage in the future. I don't know why usage is so low. .5% less fee and free tokens on buy/sell

28,@LooksRareNFT @ZoddLooksRare Many collections art doesn’t load. And the “properties” UI/UX when on an NFT is weird. Maybe im just used to OS

31,"@NeonApesYC Afaik, even signing doesn’t do anything. Just proves you’re in control at the time. You have to actually pay gas to be exploited. (Or type your seed phrase of course)"

49,@kingtrippy5116 @LooksRareNFT @opensea You get $LOOKS back for buying/selling. Currently it's paying about 2%. So really the fee doesn't exist. That's why there's wash trading
50,@codyboston19 No brainer to get some exposure
51,@blucepheus1 @opensea @BoredApeYC @LooksRareNFT why wouldn't you use LooksRare? Cheaper fee and you get $LOOKS every sale
52,"@CapetainTrippy @LooksRareNFT @opensea if the UX is the same or better, yes"

56,"@LooksRareNFT comes around and gives users free $LOOKS as everyone says how much @opensea sucks. They come with fee sharing and lower fees.

Yet everyone is still listing on OpenSea.... 🤦‍♂️"

69,"@dr_ethereum @drakedanner @iamTWB_ It wasn’t negligence. It was intentional to not change anything. If QuickSwap changed things, even just wording, that introduces possible mistakes that could lead to exploits"
70,@drakedanner QuickSwap is 100% fork of UniV2 contracts. Not a single letter was changed to keep security.
