6,@mooncat2878 @CelsiusNetwork Thanks makes sense to hodl securely!
7,"@mooncat2878 Would you put in a cold vault - or try to earn using Bitcoin as collateral or defi platforms? Just hodling for decades with $38,000 locked in!"
8,@FedorovMykhailo Ordinary Russians - some of who are risking a lot by protesting in Moscow - they need crypto as much as anyone else - especially considering the sanctions that will hurt ordinary more than billionaire oligarchs. Banning users is not the crypto way!
9,@iamDCinvestor @waiting_f_t_sun Definetly not worth it IMO - think it will make Putin even more desperate (can’t see him conceding) and should only have been used where direct conflict with US/NATO.  Thanks for sharing your take - nice to see some critical thinking in my timeline 99% is invisible friends/mfers
10,@pussyrrriot Done my bit!
11,@iamDCinvestor @waiting_f_t_sun unpopular take but do you think current situation was worth using SWIFT sanction? Once done it shows all other world powers that they can’t rely on USD settlement in emergencies. Feel like you can only do this once and this may start the slow decline of US settlement!
