14,"@Ronedwards1_ Maybe so. Have a hard time believing any reason Putin would give. He’s a megalomaniac with a military at his disposal. Feels more like a bloodlust power play to me than anything logical. I don’t know shit about shit, though"
15,"@Ronedwards1_ It’s unfolding as much because of orange face as anyone. He was impeached, in part, for withholding military aid to the Ukraine which weakened their ability to defend an attack - not much of a leap to assume Putin was involved and knew this would be the outcome"
16,"RT @mattmfm: To say this, from Moscow, takes incredible courage. Bravo to @vkaramurza for his steadfast opposition to the Putin regime."
17,@huhhhhhNFT I think it highlights many peoples need to follow something/someone. Otherwise “normal” people get caught up in crazy religions or cults for the same reason. I agree it’s a little cringe but also think it’s kind of human nature.
18,"@2Legitkennels This thread is not short of people saying their DM’s are open, but let me add my name to the list. Brave of you to reach out and we are here. Use us!"
19,Thanks to @InvsbleFriends for the boost in the @doodles floor as people sell pre-reveal to buy the doods

21,@baldmansam It’s probably a good thing to be retired. Hope you and the fam are well

33,@thenftattorney Plz have guests. Plz have me as guest.
34,@Versuhtyle The key is just to have very few followers so no one ever questions you 🤗
35,@CryptoRobC @thingdoms It’s all @DumpsterDorks all the time. Wish I had snagged more at .1 a few days ago. https://t.co/V6BrnYVIeF
36,@Arinabbart Points for creativity. I hope we get an update on how it goes
37,@CryptoNFTs @benmayorwhite @beaniemaxi Easy defense mechanism when called out. Although I can’t pretend to know what I don’t know. His post just seemed to imply they were cool til recently. Like - you didn’t know THE scammer of the space was a scammer?
38,@CryptoNFTs @benmayorwhite @beaniemaxi Me too 😱
39,"@benmayorwhite @CryptoNFTs @beaniemaxi One of those “he may scam people, but hasn’t scammed me so I’m okay with him” things? 😬"
40,"@doodles certainly riled up NFT Twitter with their merch launch. Love it or hate it or somewhere in between, please give some love to ""Made in the USA"" (which I'm sure played a role in price) - Sadly ""Made in China"" but brighter colors would have gotten more love 😩"
41,@ohihello1 @DumpsterDorks Supppppp https://t.co/hvrzup9LPv
42,"@thenftattorney @Degentraland @doodles I’d agree with some of the criticism. The denim jackets SLAPPED. Bold. Vibrant. If you need to tone it down so it isn’t a hundred hours of stitching, see @creatureNFT clothing line. (Worth noting, I loved the Miami Merch)"

91,"@zscuffed My guess is legit, just over-marketed/hyped. Large number of bot followers (they tout the tens of thousands they ban on Discord frequently). They did the grind/hustle/be fake positive for WL strategy that had people in a frenzy for months. The merch before launch is off to me"
