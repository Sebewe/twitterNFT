6,@posvar @ExpansionPunks Dammmnnnnn ..... well done!
7,A really good way to think about using 1ETH.  And then it's likely one of these projects will give you a presale opportunity you will like to mint something using the additional 0.4ETH. https://t.co/lqxFRlHdyb

He would usually do 5-10 at a time (I think) at different price points as the price went up each notch.  If sales were slow on a given day it took time to move past those."
