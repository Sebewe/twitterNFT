If you think the platform has room to grow than you just stake and wait. 1 year from now they can capture enough volume to make rewards worth it again. If you don't believe that sell and move on. If you do, stake."

40,@Versuhtyle Says this but prob buys into looks copy pasta x2y2 lol
41,@dadjudicator Look at the sales the last 2 days. Most are from the project creator. And he sent a bunch of free ones to other wallets it looked like in my quick 2min investigation. Most likely engaged influencers and joint pumped it.
42,"@j1mmyeth You legit asked me last night for a quick fiver so you could snag some Wendy's spicy chicken nuggies. ""I don't do paper money bro"" were your exact words. (prob not a true story)"

44,@isotile That's not confirmed?
45,@LeonidasNFT @ArtHouseGarbage 16 days before BAYC....you really think it took BAYC 16 days to put together art and decided that dog project was the one they would take all the traits for. BAKC you at least have enough time for them to take notice of the traits etc. But makes no sense for original collection.
46,"@0xBender Same, just seemed like exactly what I'd make someone do if I wanted to rug your NFTs. Free tokens, force you to approve good nft projects etc. I haven't seen an email that shows this was a phishing email though. So I'm curious where the approval came from."

57,@iKnowKnow_NFT @itstylersays @nftworldsNFT That be insane haha
58,@itstylersays No offense to nftworlds but they also don't have to build a game. They are using a billion dollar game as their backbone. That leaves a lot of dev work left for other things. My biggest fear with NFTworlds is that Minecraft just says no and takes them to court.
59,@m00neth @BlueBadger2600 @kyriall_ @LooksRareNFT I'm literally concerned this is a massive rug to get you to connect nft collections. Forcing users to list multiple is a huge red flag when the one issue people find in the contract is they can pull any nft you approve.
60,@ABigThingBadly @the_x2y2 Has anyone figured out that possible issue with contract where they could take control/move any nft you approve?
61,@ethlizards https://t.co/NENQGM2A1C
62,Come hangout tonight! https://t.co/4Tw0SWeEiI
63,@667R_ @BlazerFan8080 Haha I've had worse
64,@jasonclements Yea I'd need to find the thread again. But someone found that there was a possibility for them to make a call that would give them control over any nft you approved and ultimately just transfer all of a collection of they wanted.
65,@667R_ @BlazerFan8080 Yea it looks completely ripped from Looks rare.
66,@BlazerFan8080 X2y2
67,So a new platform gives you free tokens but requires you to lost at list 50 tokens or 5 diff collections....and the contract seems that it could pull anything you approve....and y'all are still claiming ... I would not connect. This could be a multi month scam. Fix that contract.

79,@ktrap @opensea Open Sea exposes themselves to the legal risk of processing those goods.
80,@ktrap @opensea Because you're saying let scammrs continue to scam it's ok because we need to protect the people who bought from them. It's a terrible take. Scams need to be shut down and stopped. If you buy stolen goods you can't just resell it just because you didn't steal them.
81,@ktrap @opensea ..yes its a fraudulent project lol That's like saying you can sell fake Nike's on the secondary market because you weren't the person who made the fake. Shits a scam let it die and move on. The space doesn't need this.
82,"@ktrap @opensea Lol ""Hey can you openly allow fraud on your website so I can get some bags pumped?"" No bro. We need to stop fraud in this space, Open Sea has a obligation to their customers to try thier best to protect them from fraud. Its not truly decentralized but we need these scams to stop."
