58,@kzolson19 @grantpat @704Saints @heckman_eth at one point I had these in almost every colorway. fun thread… I’ll be  getting a pair to show my support (and look sharp)
59,Bullish on @GutterCatGang and even more bullish on the community members. tons of like minded and smart people in the gutter that’s for sure. Love to see it
60,RT @grantpat: Already in and ready for whatever is behind those doors @GutterCatGang https://t.co/wkSB9AEHbW
61,@grantpat @704Saints @heckman_eth Oh it’s happening. Enjoying this thread. we all going to be in those classics soon
62,@704Saints @grantpat @heckman_eth adding these back into the rotation https://t.co/D5L4m3CBkW
63,@YatMuseum @grantpat With gcg collab they reignited my interest. I was poking fun earlier with a bit of truth from personal experience but I like what I see happening 👍
64,@704Saints @grantpat @heckman_eth Yeah future is looking good for them! I’m only speaking of past decade or so. Sports commitment will pay off for them as it’ll translate back to style wear
65,"@grantpat @704Saints @heckman_eth And are making very smart moves! Melo, Neymar, Lewis Hamilton…. Awesome to see. Still have an old army style puma hat I will never throw away. and with GCG collab I think I’ll go back and grab a pair of classics 👟 … was a big puma fan back in my HS days"
66,@704Saints @grantpat @heckman_eth i once liked everything puma made but they faded at some point… I’m all for the new direction and resurgence we are seeing with them tho! And agree GCG international!
67,@grantpat @heckman_eth this is getting some attention but I’d still bet none of these likes own much if any puma gear. aside from financials which we can see are still pretty strong worldwide. with all do respect to puma
68,@grantpat @heckman_eth For Sure. I’d even say that adidas lost luster at some point as Nike and Under Armour took more market share/ popularity
69,"@704Saints @grantpat @heckman_eth without knowing financials I’d say Under Armour, Reebok, lulu lemon have more consistent loyalty.. maybe even new balance and mostly meaning east coast US as far as my judgement"
70,@lmbrtt clean
71,@grantpat @heckman_eth impressed with their new commitment to their pro roster. good to see some life breathed into a solid heritage brand. they were dormant for far too long for sure.
72,@heckman_eth might be the only way to get people to wear puma 😂

74,I’m not even going to try and guess what’s happening with @GutterCatGang and the vials.  I’m just happy there’s something and hoping we don’t h have to wait long for results. #soon
