54,We’re at an interesting spot in the grand scheme. Crypto is seeing huge adoption and publicity yet at the same time facing headwinds with the general macro financial conditions. Interesting tug-of-war at play

96,@tmagled @JohnBeane20 @LooksRareNFT I know he was a seed investor but the project is not run by Cole in any way. Don’t care to argue with you all day. My point is your original post came across as whining that you didn’t get more free money.
97,@JohnBeane20 @tmagled @LooksRareNFT You think LOOKS is in the same ballpark as Cole?
98,@boxofcorey @tmagled @LooksRareNFT Lol yea I literally did nothing and got free money from there. I don’t care that others got more. I know that’s kinda crazy to comprehend
