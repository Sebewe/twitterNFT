29,@blawgchain @gblsts @__DeFi__ @SuperRare @SuperRareLabs @keeead @SuperRarePerks Thanks. That’s what I thought at first but got confused by the breakdown.
30,"@blawgchain @gblsts @__DeFi__ @SuperRare @SuperRareLabs @keeead @SuperRarePerks So for primary sales by independent artists (third chart), does 3% of the sales go into the DAO treasury? Where does the rest of the 12% of the 15% go? I’m sorry if this is a stupid question."
31,@blawgchain @gblsts @__DeFi__ @SuperRare @SuperRareLabs @keeead @SuperRarePerks How does the community treasury differ from the ‘network fee to community treasury’ in the two primary sales chart?
32,@ZeeMD95 Still selling?
33,@dgibs16 @nikkiii_x0 @iamdabinlee Are you still selling one?
34,@SnoopDogg gm
35,"@blawgchain @SuperRare For primary sales, what is the difference between the 3% network fee and the 15% community treasury? Do they not all go into the DAO treasury?"
36,@blawgchain @SuperRare Thanks. Was just wondering if there is an avenue (e.g. Snapshot) where proposals will be posted and voted on.
37,@blawgchain @SuperRare Where will the voting on Super Rare Dao proposals be conducted? And how soon do you expect we can start voting? I’ve just joined the DAO on Reddit but don’t see that much activity on there as of now.
