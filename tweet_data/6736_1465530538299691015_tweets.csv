0,@Zssbeckerbs @thedefiedge Bam! Right here…Perfect example of how many scams are in the crypto space! Be safe and have caution every step of the way!
1,Comment if you have any other good tips for new people entering the crypto space.
2,7. Check out @Crypt0Builders for help along your way!
3,6. Build something. The space is growing super fast and there is so much money being moved everyday. It is easier than ever to gain traction and make money now than ever before.
4,"5. Pick a niche and study it HARD. Whether that be DeFi, NFTs, etc. Pick something a later focus on it and you will be better than 99% of investors because the majority try to do everything."
5,4. Never ever ever ever do something because someone says you should. Always DYOR no matter who’s telling you something.  Think for yourself!
6,"3. Get a solid list of legit people to follow in the crypto space to see how they think and talk about the market movements. They will also provide tips and info that you can use yourself. Some examples:

@thedefiedge @ZssBecker @JRNYcrypto"
7,2. Don’t ever click any links or do anything involving your wallet information if you don’t know exactly why it’s asking for it. There are tons of clever scams out there and to make it in this space make sure you are safe and secure.
8,1. There is a ton of noise in the market with new projects launching daily. Don’t get caught up with all the hype and FOMO. Make sure you do your research and I would recommend studying projects for days or even weeks before buying in.
