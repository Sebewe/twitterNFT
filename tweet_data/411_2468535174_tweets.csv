13,"@abeorlt @WesleyP38204803 @John01019977 @XXSOSVITAXX @avi_grey @raptalksk None of what you’ve said is objectively wrong, it just reeks of ignorance and privilege. The existence of capitalism requires an underclass, not everyone can be rich and stating that is not “giving excuses”, it’s reality."

15,"@abeorlt @WesleyP38204803 @John01019977 @XXSOSVITAXX @avi_grey @raptalksk The point is that you shouldn’t have to do that. Someone working 40hrs a week shouldn’t have to worry about paying for food in the richest country in the world, especially at a time when billionaires are making more money than ever and paying less in taxes than you and me."
16,@abeorlt @John01019977 @XXSOSVITAXX @avi_grey @raptalksk Minimum wage hasn’t risen in like 15 years while everything has gotten more expensive. At some point you have to realize there’s more to it than how hard you work.
