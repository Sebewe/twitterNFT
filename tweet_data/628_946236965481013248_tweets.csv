11,The Sandbox Discord scammers are inspired today. They have a whole team pretending to be mods.
12,@stevecheslock @tropoFarmer Every BAYC or MAYC is a potential character in a story. In my opinion it's just starting to get some attention. It will be really hot when a bunch of projects using the IP start coming out. Jenkins the Valet and Kingship are examples of it.
13,"@stevecheslock @tropoFarmer I see BAYC potentially becoming the biggest brand in entertainment. Music festival, bands, games, movies, books... The NFT space is small, but this brand is paving the way and bringing a lot of attention. And as Tropo said, $APE is what will give people exposure to the brand."
14,@tropoFarmer That's why I sold 2 Cats today and bought 2 more MAYC. I see every kid wanting some $APE
15,"@tmagled @RustySailor_ @BoredApeYC Haha, I've met this duo in NY getting tickets for the warehouse!"

22,@tmagled_eth Now it's actually a good time for people to use their $ENS and vote him out.
23,People shouldn't forget that ENS is a DAO and you can vote people out. It's supposed to be bigger than one individual.
24,"@MrStats_ You can claim it anytime in the future, right? I'm thinking it might add a premium."

43,@dgntec @heaven_computer @beautyandpunk Happy to find more Brazilians in the space.
44,"OpenSea is so successful because of its UI/UX imo. LooksRare has a lot of work to do on that end. Once they nail it, they over-throne OS."
