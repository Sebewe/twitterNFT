18,"@tygrpuppy mmmmmmm very good pointtttt 🤔🤔🤔🤔 need to think on this more tbh… the question is does the value of labor change based on location? im not too sure, all depends on revenue and location of org i guess"
19,@v_stickykeys @RebeccaLamis It is how US law is set up! If you are salary and work long hours you dont get legally compensated. But hourly labor gets OT. So I would say making everyone hourly says MORE of the latter than salary!!
20,@motherpredicate veryyyyy truuuu! especially single use plastic
21,"i know too many subjects at this point 😭😭😭😭 ya gurl rlly modern renaissance girlie; chemistry, biology, math, gender studies, economics, finance, art/voice, history, sociology, tech/blockchain/web3… 😭😭😭😭 help meeeeeeeee"
22,@RebeccaLamis hmmmmm interesting model 🤔🤔🤔 I think I am generally opposed to salary! I realize hourly protects workers more from being exploited. And hourly can be given same benefits as salaried employee.
23,"If you think you should get paid more than you colleagues, I ask you why? I have yet to come to any compelling reason as I start to have people who work with me and I control the budget."
24,@raeituo lmaaoooo truuuu
25,havent checked source but my gut says this shows supply picture 👀👀👀👀 im telling yall im right https://t.co/qApE13gPF8
26,@damedoteth its honestly just a more honest and open version of US governance hahahaha oligarchies be oligarchying
27,"TLDR: Oil/gas isnt bad, but we need to stop BURNING IT ALL. Bring back trains and stop greed based economic systems that encourage quick consumption &gt; longevity of goods."
28,"I know the irony of my new @Commsaur pfp being a dino is amazing, but oil/gas is not evil! It is our over utilization of the resource that is killing us. Also planned obsolescence (capitalist “innovation”) is burning our limited metals and catalysts supplies. Soooooo complicated."
29,"Using fossil fuels to produce goods like solar panels and computers that PRODUCE more sustainable communication and energy than the chemical process it takes to produce them is a more mid term solution, especially with “green chemistry” innovations that use less harsh solvents."
30,"I do not know the stats, but if people and transportation are not DIRECTLY dependent on fossil fuels we will have a lot more to convert into goods. I am less well versed on the chem, but polymer chemistry produces WAY LESS CO2 chemically than PHYSICALLY BURNING it in combustion."
31,"hot take + chem: Converting oil/gas from a consumer good to a supply chain good will bring about an era of peace. Most of our modern goods, based on polymer chemistry, requires carbon. Our modern goods require fossil fuels in the supply chain, including electronics and plastics."
32,the fact we stuck with these prominent gigachad billionaires for the next few decades kills me 😩😩😩😩 all that capitol wasted and hoarded
33,People need to learn about dialectics: two seemingly opposing things/feelings can both be true. It massively levels up ones ability to develop seeming “profound” hypothesis or statements.
34,set the reminder yall! https://t.co/CO3xHnNbrk

51,"I regret ever trying to loose weight. I wish I just did the harder work of loving myself as I am sooner, but its never too late to start. Happy I have started and can just enjoy my life as it comes with the body that keeps me going. 💖🌈✊🏽"
52,"We cant control our weight, so we should not bother trying. I am fat/chub and still moved my body. Could rock climb better than most skinny/muscular folks. Release the shame of fat rolls and bellies. Wear tight cloths and crop tops. Weight cycling is far far worse than being fat."
53,"Hope someone benefits from this, but I wish I never lost weight. I was miserable when I was thin and have regained the weight back (which is typical). The reality is that being thin did not make me love myself, only loving myself did that."
54,@WGMInterfaces much love and respect 💖🌈💐✊🏽🥂

62,"Seeing the racism in Ukraine is heartbreaking. The euro diaspora reaction to Ukraine has shown me how anti-browness/blackness is global.  Two things can be true:

1. War and imperialism is never ok.
2. Euro + diaspora is racist af and it shows in yalls asymmetric responses to #1."
63,"geez we livin in hard times, just trying to not shame or judge myself for what I am doing to keep myself feeling content"
64,"US is trying to return to fascism. The next 10 years will be hard, but they wont snuff us out this time. Read the “7th Fire Prophecy.” Choose correctly this time, its your choice; you hold power. Choose peace, acceptance, and love. We will be here to welcome you home to humanity. https://t.co/tHqsFmVMi9"
65,@Chipagosfinest lmaaaoooooooo always good to think about it before profits start rolling in!

91,"@HawkwardArt This is now a time for euro-amers to wake up to US history. Listen to black and indigenous folks, fight for our liberation, and look back to their own indigeneity. There is not much we can do outside send money to Ukraine, but we can do a lot in the US imperial core."
