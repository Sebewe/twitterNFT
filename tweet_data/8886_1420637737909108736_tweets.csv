https://t.co/dBHTJ4PS1d"
73,"- @sartoshi 'approved' 
- funny, creative design

DYOR &amp; LFG #mfers!

🔥💪👌🐂📈🚀😎🍻🆙

4/4"
74,"- huge proven volume when #mfers were pumping last time (13/02)
- lots of creative ideas in the pipeline with a focus on 'dads'
- the treasury &amp; all dadmfers holders (who claimed) own one of the 1/1 #mfers (gutter cat) via $DAD token

3/4"
75,"- solid creative devs who are crazy open minded for community suggestions. Lot of different decisions were taken from discord votes. They also randomly raffled their most precious 1/1 to random discord members.
- crazy low floor rn (0.009 ETH) 

2/4"
76,"Some reasons why I think @dadmfers might be a good alternative derivative #mfers investment: 

- Only 2.6k supply 
- 100% match with the original 'Are ya winning, son?' meme.  
- same rarity/trait levels as #mfers which makes it easy for new investors to buy the good ones

1/4"
77,@st_bomba @dadmfers *forgot to mention -&gt; only 2.6k supply 😅
78,@st_bomba @dadmfers -&gt; cheap floor and huge volume when mfers were pumping last time. Same rarity levels as mfers which makes it easy for new investors to buy the rare ones. Also team are solid creative devs who listen to the holders. Many great ideas in the pipeline 💯
