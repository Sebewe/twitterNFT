2,"@curcio_ml Would using uni v3 positions to ""hedge"" squeeth make money then?"
3,"@AlexKEuler It's not clear to me either 😅 
From my article: ""Why would someone want to hedge a long squeeth? I’m not entirely sure."" 
But I guess a net positive income may result from shorting ETH on a perp futures exchange and collecting fees by deploying the Uni v3 LP position."
4,"@StittsHappening @DefiEdge Not sure if collecting fees scales linearly with the number of positions since you only need to sign the transaction once.
@DefiEdge: how does that work on https://t.co/uPFobXBmSK?"
5,"11/ It is easy to see how this approach can be generalized to neutralize the gamma of any (positive convexity) payoff function.

Power perp? Log perp? Exponential perp? Long options? Binary options? The gamma for all of them could be hedged using Uni v3.

Happy hedging! 🌲🌲🌲🌲"
6,"10/ Deploying 8 LP positions may cost a lot of gas, but it could easily be done using a Decentralized Asset Management tool like @DefiEdge

For instance, 4 LP positions can be deployed at the same time in on https://t.co/OKsd3Mi5rI (I'm told &gt;5 positions will be enabled soon) https://t.co/ek2pSoqtpi"
7,"9/ Hedging the delta of the combined position results in a payoff curve that's flat in both value and delta (in green below) across the entire range of the LP positions.

It is thus possible to construct a fully hedged squeeth whose value stays constant over any arbitrary range. https://t.co/2SH72bQveP"
8,"8/ Deploying several Uni v3 LP position with the right liquidity makes the gamma of the LP position exactly equal to -2, thereby neutralizing squeeth's gamma = 2

The approximation can be improved by adding more LP positions. I'm showing an example using 8 positions. https://t.co/SqBLIci9U7"
9,"7/ In other words, they can be used as the basis of what I call the Gamma Transform, which can be used to approximate any payoffs with negative convexity as the linear combination of several 1-tick positions.

Let's apply this to squeeth, whose gamma is always equal to 2"
10,"6/ Why do we care? 1-tick positions can be seen as a Kronecker delta, which is zero everywhere and with an area equal to 1 at the current tick.

Since each 1-tick position have no overlap and they are all independent of one another, they can be used to approximate any function: https://t.co/8WwZU5M42X"
11,"5/ More specifically, its shape looks like a rectangle of width 2K*(r-1). To keep the area under that curve equal to unity, the height of that rectangle needs to be -1/(2K*(r-1)): https://t.co/vffYOvfJGT"
12,"4/ If we look at the gamma of a Uni v3 LP position, then things get interesting: both gamma and delta are discontinuous at the upper and low price, but the Gamma of a single-tick Uni v3 position looks (almost) like a rectangle as the range factor approaches 1 https://t.co/lzk9LcOsgV"
13,"3/ Now let's consider squeeth, a recently released financial product by the @Opyn team. 

Squeeth is a type of power perpetual whose return is equal to the square of the price of ETH (squeeth = square-eth)

It's gamma is constant at all price and always equal to 2: https://t.co/4NTreR85i8"
14,"2/ Formally, Gamma is defined as the second derivative of the value of an asset. Recall that delta is the first derivative of the value of an asset

Delta = slope, Gamma = slope of the slope

Here's the gamma and delta for a positive convexity instrument like a long call option. https://t.co/afiptMuq9J"
15,"1/ First, what is gamma? Gamma is a measure of the ""convexity"" of an asset. 
An asset with a positive convexity will increase in value faster as its price goes up. OTOH, an asset with negative convexity will see diminishing returns.
Here's a graph showing how gamma affects price: https://t.co/A8pzR7DlSN"
16,"I just published: ""Gamma transforms: How to hedge squeeth using Uni V3""

We demonstrate how 1-tick Uni v3 LP positions can perfectly hedge the gamma of positive convexity assets like squeeth.

Gamma transforms? squeeth? convexity?

34,"@0xdoug But you're right about fees in high vol regimes.

•0.3% pool: IV = 96%
•0.05% pool: IV = 82%

35,"@0xdoug How low is low vol regimes?

The max fee on Uniswap is 1%. The implied volatility needs to be less than ~19% for the daily 1sd expected to be less than 1%.

60,"@AseemSood_ Yes. But it will only be profitable if you expect the price to increase again, so the overall assumption is bullish in the long term despite a short-term bearish bout.

63,"6/8  LPs that hold a truly bearish perspective on an asset may even deploy a bearish LP position by borrowing 200% of the token and selling a part of it so that they can lock it at 50:50 ratio.

65,"4/8  As an alternative to LM, liquidity providers should have the opportunity to provide liquidity with an asset borrowed on @eulerfinance instead of buying it outright

66,"3/8  As a result, LPs should simply withdraw all assets from bearish pools in order to protect their portfolio’s value.

Liquidity mining can offset some of these losses, but LM is not sustainable and could lead to the price spiraling down due to a selling feedback loops."
67,"2/8  The problem with liquidity providing is that only pools with a bullish token are profitable.

That's because the value of a LP position has a positive delta and it will follow the price of the asset.
