54,"@Kuniyaay It’s the guy with the MAYC pfp right? I saw that too. Ppl tried to locate his mint/sales TX to back up what he was saying, but couldn’t find anything lol"
55,"It's quite ironic to me how certain big NFT twitter ppl who routinely dump their 10e+ bags onto newer (albeit wealthy) people in the space, are now warning ""dOn'T buY iF aT 8e"", when many of the holders are small fish in the space to begin with"
56,"FYI - 
Being the largest holder of Slimhoods for months (100+), I asked @coinbilly_  if I could have more than 1 IF mint. He said no to even 2 mints. 
While I was salty at first, I came to terms with that because ultimately a fair launch would be best for RCC given the demand."
57,"What other project has ~90% unique holders that were carefully vetted for WEEKS to ensure no spreading of the points? 

I can't think of any that would go to those lengths to protect the distribution of the collection."
58,@chichi_oowa @InvsbleFriends I'm not shading on other projects. I just think that it's absolutely silly to compare those other projects to this one.
59,"This ain't just another ape project. This isn't some indifferentiable robot head. This is the life work of @MotionMarkus, for which the quality 99% of artists wouldn't be able to achieve, even if they put in the time"
60,"People fudding Invisible Friends left and right, like it literally isn’t the best art we’ve ever seen in the space

Pulling up Meka and Hape comparables smh 🤦🏻‍♂️ Next thing you know they’re gonna compare Hype Bears or some shit

Makes me doubly sure to hold mine through reveal, tbh"
61,"@oLdurtybasturd @eddyiskongz @hectornft @InvsbleFriends If by overdeliver you mean the Hapes had ears going thru hats, then sure haha. IF ain’t gonna make amateur mistakes like that"
62,@JamesJo52839421 @KosherPlug i’m fuckin rolling LOL
63,"@eddyiskongz @hectornft @InvsbleFriends Roadmaps don’t matter as much as you think they do. Actually, they might even be a detriment to prices sometimes, because if the team doesn’t deliver as promised, the community is let down. That’s why the motto ‘underpromise and overdeliver’ is so powerful"
