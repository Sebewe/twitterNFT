56,"Hopefully this will also transfer over to taxes, where instead of the current guidance on paying taxes for every swap to USD stablecoins, you just pay gains when you cash out on exchanges."
57,"Unpopular opinion: the bitcoin seizure from the pipeline ransom is great news. It will convince politicians that they don’t need to get rid of, or regulate crypto activities inside of the network, but rather regulate the entry and exit points."
58,"@AmineKamel84 @asianhodl1 @alexis709a @business You are saying it is harder to maintain 51%, but that doesn’t mean it’s harder to get there."
59,@asianhodl1 @AmineKamel84 @alexis709a @business But I am saying it’s the same or better because the supply of ETH is more reactive to demand than the supply of mining equipment.
60,"@asianhodl1 @AmineKamel84 @alexis709a @business For the reasons I said above, it is either the same or PoS makes it slightly more difficult to collude. You have to factor in the motivations for collusion and what the expected outcome for colluders would be. If profit, it would cost a ton, if destruction, it is impossible."
61,"@asianhodl1 @AmineKamel84 @alexis709a @business There is, same as BTC, but PoS doesn’t make that any easier."
62,"@asianhodl1 @AmineKamel84 @alexis709a @business Well what would the motivation of collusion be? For it to be an organization the motivation would have to be profit. Otherwise if it were a government it would be to destroy the protocol, but they would have a hard time finding partners for that. So they’d drive up price buying."
63,"@asianhodl1 @AmineKamel84 @alexis709a @business The expected reward of a party who wasn’t going to collude but got convinced to would increase, and the further they are from being the 1st person to collude the higher their price or expected reward would need to be."
64,"@asianhodl1 @AmineKamel84 @alexis709a @business With BTC, either price goes up for mining equipment or price goes up for convincing miners to join your effort. For eth either price goes up for buying more ETH or price goes up for convincing validates to join your effort."
65,"@asianhodl1 @AmineKamel84 @alexis709a @business My point is it’s the same, because to strike agreements in PoS to collude the price of buying ETH would go up along with the price to get a colluding party to cooperate."
66,"@asianhodl1 @AmineKamel84 @alexis709a @business In theory, but it’s no more likely than PoW collusion. You could pay off every miner to collude or buy all mining equipment to get 51%, but it would be progressively more expensive as people realize the demand for equipment is increasing, or the bargaining power for miners."
67,"@asianhodl1 @AmineKamel84 @alexis709a @business Those are people who have staked so far, many more will stake once it’s online, and there will be pools for ordinary people to stake. But yes I’m very worried about the testnet being manipulated in the meantime."
68,@asianhodl1 @AmineKamel84 @alexis709a @business The biggest exchange has less than 2% of the total supply
69,@BitcoinMidas_ @business The biggest ETH wallet only owns 2% of total supply. You could say maybe one person or org has a bunch of different wallets but that’s pure speculation.
70,"@BitcoinMidas_ @business It is extremely cost prohibitive for someone to get 51%, and even if they do, doing so would make everyone leave the network and guarantee the billions they have spent are now worthless."
71,"@AmineKamel84 @alexis709a @asianhodl1 @business In PoS for someone to get a controlling stake they need to buy up a ton of ETH, driving the price up and making it prohibitive to get control as the price increase will cause others to see it as a bull run and buy themselves. Then, if they do end up getting 51%, people will leave"
