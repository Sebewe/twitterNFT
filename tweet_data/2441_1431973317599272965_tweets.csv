1. District that it belongs to: Entertainment / Adult / Education / Business / Creative.

2. Size of the plot: Standard / Medium / Large / Giant / Mega."
11,"@DoseETH @NetVRk1 Floor recently popped from about 0.7 and with ETH potentially going further down, it might be one to keep an eye on."

13,"Now felt like the right time to buy another @JRNYclub pass. 
Irrespective of market cycles and short-term price action, builders are going to build.  
I have the utmost confidence that the community that @TonySparkOG is building will be at the forefront of that. https://t.co/ef68ZFreeK"
14,@TheFancierNFT @JRNYclub Planning to get another JRNY Pass. Put it this way: Tony’s going to deliver value to his community and that’s a given 🚀
15,"ERC-1155 projects will grab a place of their own, as the NFT space develops and PFP projects encounter a level of market saturation. 

These community access passes might onboard new users into the NFT space who could have been previously only observing from the distance.  

4/4"
16,"We’re witnessing NFT projects offering more on their roadmaps than a few months ago (DAO, gamification, tokens, etc.). 

Utility is key. As PFP projects go in and out of hype cycles, it is the utility and community that will ultimately dictate long-term price action. 

3/4"
17,"ERC-1155 type NFTs offer a much more consumer-friendly model where you now own the content and can even sell your “membership”, if you wanted to. 

2/4"
18,"All online education can be sold as NFTs. 

Are we going to see ERC-1155 type NFTs fully replace the Patreon subscription model?

These are the kind of NFTs that offer access to private information and act as a gateway to private communities.

26,"NFTs can be a reliable store of value during shifting market conditions.

Distinct from their underlying cryptocurrency ($ETH / $SOL), NFTs are clearly an asset class of their own, driven by their cultural significance, scarcity and utility."
