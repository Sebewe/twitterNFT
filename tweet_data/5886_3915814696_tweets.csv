1,@iwwon_official @sabet Great news!!   Now maybe sabet will be the first to lower creator royalties to a reasonable level.   10% creator fees on secondary sales is predatory.   Investors should not support excessive fees.

11,@CryptoMories @sabet The damage to his own brand is why he retracted.   Any creator charging 10% royalties on a collection with thousands of pieces is showing your their level of greed.   @sabet is at max greed level.
