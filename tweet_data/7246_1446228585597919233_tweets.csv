17,"@6GOD102 How does innovation occur if no one has the drive to make it happen? It’s a risk, but if it works it could be worth it."
18,@isaacHaku Could be interesting 👀
19,"@suuziETH That could be interesting. However, I think that some sort of pre-determined plan builds trust for the early adopters"
20,@suuziETH The actions are determined ahead of time as use of proceeds. They correspond with the money raised from the % of the supply selling out.
21,Was thinking about this for a roadmap. Imagine if you had a choice over what specific actions were taken on the project as a holder and each step within the roadmap was triggered by how much of the supply sold. Just starting with mint open instead of marketing for months. https://t.co/YHcQEsrQQk

59,@V1Zhual I've been thinking of how gaming could play a role. Would be cool if something like Blitz or any of the other trackers to reward for performance. Connect the wallet then register for the opportunity to mint and gamers can compete in a multitude of games.
