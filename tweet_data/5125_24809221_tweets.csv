25,@owocki If you haven’t injected drugs into those m&amp;ms I am going to be seriously disappointed…
26,"@curve_crvsader Kek, well played"
27,@SchorLukas A lot of overhead and risk just to store IP. https://t.co/F1wqpBR6N1

37,@econoar Wow and I thought I was optimistic…
38,"@bluehairscalper See the funny thing is, if I say someone is “evil” I am not like condemning them to an eternity of hellfire, when you say it…"
39,"@bluehairscalper I disagree with your cosmology, but as long as you don’t use it to justify hating arbitrary groups of people I take no issue with you believing it."
40,Thank you Hudson for taking the time to put this situation in perspective. https://t.co/qXP9E68MT5
41,"@evabeylin Again highly dependant on the circumstances, if I say or do something that hurts you inadvertently, it’s pretty likely I will apologise and try to understand what went wrong, because I try not to say hurtful things. Twitter shitposting notwithstanding."
42,@evabeylin Failing to show remorse and saying I did this and I don’t care what anyone thinks are not the same thing. If a defendant stands up at the start of a trial and admits guilt they will in most legal systems proceed to sentencing.
43,@MattLosquadro @synthetix_io Por que no los dos
44,"@evabeylin Most trials don’t start with the defendant saying “i did this, and I’d do it again if I had the chance” so this analogy is a little weak imo."
45,@bluehairscalper If any of the CC’s are actively undermining our inclusive community by targeting arbitrary groups of people they should be removed. I’ve seen nothing that would indicate that needs to happen with any current or former CC though.
46,@DeFi_Dad @gblanz8 @SNXified @synthetix_io In
47,"Not sure who needs to hear this but maybe if a giant imaginary man in the sky tells you to hate arbitrary groups of people, ignore them 🤷‍♂️"
48,ngl did not expect to find myself in a timeline where OHM became a $69 stablecoin but I am here for it.

51,@abbey_titcomb @Melt_Dem @StaniKulechov Ok this is getting a little too edgy for my liking now.
52,@BlockEnthusiast @synthetix_io Ah that’s useful thanks!
53,"I’m going to regret this no doubt, but has anyone studied the proposal rate in decentralised governance systems. I’m curious where @synthetix_io stands as we have something like 150 passed proposals at this point."
54,@larry0x Side note I’m impressed they have 185 proposals.
55,"@larry0x I am guessing without reading the proposal that it’s because synthetix makes no distinction between synthetics within the network, vs the silo approach that terra takes."
56,"@abbey_titcomb Tbh I was actually surprised to find I followed someone with less than 10k followers, must have fat fingered the follow button."
57,@abbey_titcomb I didn’t even mint it I fomo’ed in late like usual after seeing Stani with one.

73,@Jacob___Meyer How are you?
74,"Fundamental question to ask yourself about a DeFi protocol. Is there any one person or persons who can unilaterally change the protocol without token holder oversight. Ok great, now do the counterfactual on this."
75,"While I still love Mycrypto I use it far less today than I do metamask, super excited to see what these two teams cook up together. The awesome people at Mycrypto are going to have a much bigger platform to work with now, which is amazing. https://t.co/IbtZ4SL2I5"

89,Once the V3GM is live you could in theory elect someone to the role of king of Sushi and they would be delegated authority to do anything but token holders would be able to veto any malicious changes. Ngl I’d be up for it for an epoch under those terms. https://t.co/L4eNLMukEn

92,@AFDudley0 @kelvinfichter @arbitrum @optimismPBC Hmm I don’t know I’m sure in 1950 there were still people who were like vacuum tubes are gonna win this thing we just need some more juice or some shit. I don’t think we have consensus on OR winning medium term but we know how to build them *ish* 😅
93,"@AFDudley0 @kelvinfichter @arbitrum @optimismPBC I guess I’d argue that we already invented rollups at a conceptual level, what is happening now is the implementation or “how to make” the phase 🤷‍♂️"
94,@Aftertilt How am I supposed to remain calm when I’m at the mercy of such insightful and witty replies?
95,@AFDudley0 @kelvinfichter @arbitrum @optimismPBC I guess I’m just fundamentally skeptical that consolidating technical research is not a false economy. I agree it is if you only have like 3 people who can do it but I think we have maybe 30-50 in this instance so not putting all our eggs in one basket is probably optimal.
96,RT @cobie: @haydenzadams @fund_defi https://t.co/Wn6G9JZ9Hk
97,@AFDudley0 @kelvinfichter All very fair points but empirically we have two fairly distinct implementations of the same underlying concept in @arbitrum and @optimismPBC. I think if everyone cooperates and we have the compromise version of the two only we MAY have a worse outcome.
98,@AFDudley0 @kelvinfichter Market forces sir.
