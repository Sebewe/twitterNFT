1,If you hold an Internship token this is worth consideration 👇 https://t.co/63Wy3oNL2n

7,@muratpak the power of story (meme)
8,@ComedyCrypto I love this!
9,"@master__pupil Just true. 

Quality is such a subjective property (Pollock, Warhol etc). 

Story is an emerging artist’s best friend IMO. Building in public allows people to feel like they’re creating alongside the artist."
10,The *quality* of the art matters less than the story behind it.
11,@ymadbruh @nftbah Has the potential to ofc
12,@DANNYw3rains @nftbah Get. Out.
13,@DaveOcampoart @nftbah 😂
14,@DaveOcampoart @nftbah I left that option out on purpose 😅
15,"Great question from @nftbah about the upcoming $ASH Chapter Two drop.

(Remember, this poll is 100% anonymous so be honest) 

🤔 What is most important to you about Ash2?"
16,"@Jims_Investing @MoonOverlord Jim, wen influencoooor!"
17,"@JordenTually @DelNFT No way! We might even have a few friends in common. 

I try to get down mid coast NSW as often as possible. Crescent Head is one of my fav surf spots."

19,"@ShortsHoward We have something similar, it just has a more creative name"
20,@lowercaseboot @astroboy_nft I'm actually not a light-maxi... my discord is dark mode... have never really noticed the difference tbh
21,@lowercaseboot @astroboy_nft may your eyes burn https://t.co/ZilCG2ItCV
22,@astroboy_nft I've never understood the religiosity of light mode v. dark mode... may as well be light side of the force v. dark side of the force for some of y'all 😂
23,"Twitter bringing the alpha with a poetic number of tweets for #BTC 

Security by way of immutability &amp; a true store of value in an increasingly inflationary environment.

24,"@novocrypto No such thing as too much quality, but ofc quality is subjective… so… how’s that for a non-answer 😅"
25,"@novocrypto It’s a question of of quality, not quantity imo"

32,@Jyotirmaya357 @jvcknft @DelNFT @_holonick_ @sec0ndstate @PaksLad @danielkoeth This is a beautiful interpretation ❤️
33,"Super excited for $ASH CHAPTER 2, these pieces look incredible!

Special shoutout to @DelNFT; whose work didn't need extra validation, but has received it nonetheless. 

Del has a heart of gold and absolutely deserves his position in this star-studded lineup.

34,"@JordenTually @DelNFT For sure. I'm on the Sunny Coast, where are you based?"
35,"note to self: complain less, be more grateful"
36,"@LongJohnGoat @discord @psychedelic_nft Nice, hopefully they put out a thread on it"
37,"There's something almost mythical about Equanimity 平静, it really draws me in. 

Thank you @jvcknft for this beautiful creation. #WeAcceptAsh https://t.co/zZFkzw0xcb"
38,"@Evan_Mann @velocirapteh @discord this is awesome Evan, do you have a link to the thread?"
39,"@velocirapteh @discord awesome, ty man"
40,"@PixelEthie @discord Thanks, this one is great"
41,@velocirapteh @discord interested in perspective of mods/admins/owners
42,"With all the recent high profile NFT project @discord hacks, has anyone put together a concise thread on discord security best practices?

Pls link me if you've seen one ❤️"
43,@_holonick_ Glad you’re on your mountain. Those mountains are particularly beautiful. Hopefully clears up soon ❤️
44,@danielkoeth @MhxAlt @DANNYw3rains Yo keep it on the DL DK… we haven’t signed the final contract yet

47,"@punk9511 @ShortsHoward “Publicly” and “privately” have very different implications. This is a weird half way zone… and also lacks context. 

Again, not defending the language… but it’s an incomplete picture which is designed to make the subject look as bad as possible. Not productive."
48,"@novocrypto Some wars seem to get more Twitter exposure than others. 

It’s interesting to see how that affects people’s public reactions."
49,@thepropgallery 💯… or 1/1’s
50,"@ShortsHoward @ape3593 Aight, let the two Texans have at it then. I wash my hands of this situation."
51,@flyingkiwikid @EricRWeinstein Ty ser ❤️
52,"@ShortsHoward I’m not endorsing the tone of his comment, but I’m also not a big fan of public executions for this sort of thing.

This isn’t a Beanie-level issue."
53,"@ShortsHoward No, it’s fair game. Just not sure it’s a fun game."
54,"@ShortsHoward This is the proper context. 

Flood gates are open for sharing screenshots now though, so hopefully that’s not a bad thing."
55,"@ShortsHoward This is a comment from a private discord, now being shared as a screenshot on Twitter. 

That’s all I’ll say, for context."
56,"@flyingkiwikid I had a few conversations today that gave me pause, and this tweet kind of summarises my feelings.

However there was certainly a nod to @EricRWeinstein’s “embedded growth obligation” concept in there - so not very original thought on my part."
57,web3 is not immune to the fact that humanity sits atop a thin veneer of civility; the integrity of which seems to be reliant on perpetual growth
58,@lowercaseboot I’m still waiting for someone to tell me I spelt “dissonance” wrong but alas
59,"@Danzimal_ @ShortsHoward @ape3593 Yes, imagine that!"
60,@ape3593 @ShortsHoward Idk why it always comes back to dick jokes with you yanks
61,@ape3593 @ShortsHoward Imagine thinking this tweet is about $ASH
62,Contrarianism for its own sake is __________
63,cognitive dissononce: when your stated beliefs don't match your eth txns

76,"It's been one year since I minted my first NFT.

This magnificent piece by @trevorjonesart actually changed the trajectory of my life.

A few months later I worked up the courage to DM Trevor and say thank you. 

His response was as kind &amp; as genuine as you'd imagine. https://t.co/EwBdc29VWo"

88,@DCCockFoster @niftygateway This is the way
89,"@finalnftart For the record, I'm not saying that anyone should attempt to copy-trade. These people have thousands of eth in reserve."
90,@finalnftart Just look at the activity on blue-chip projects and observe which well-known wallets are buying what 👀
91,"Watch closely. You'll see a few whale wallets make some absolutely 🤌 trades during this period.

From an unemotional perspective, it's quite the masterclass."
92,"To the extent that we need to talk about markets/floor prices, just remember that emotional investment decisions are almost always poor investment decisions."
93,"Forget about your bags for a moment and think about what it would feel like to wonder whether you’ll live to see the weekend.
