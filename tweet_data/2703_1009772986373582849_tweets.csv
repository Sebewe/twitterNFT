Anybody have some favorite resources on where to get started?"
3,wen launch @tryamie 🥺 https://t.co/px6iaZyYtR
4,@andrewchwalik @logseq You can export your roam content as json and import it to Logseq! Takes &lt; 3 min :)
5,@rcvd_io @DenaroCascio @rhizomyx @joeyharris @GeorgeSilverman @logseq @obsdmd Amazing! Will check them out tonight :)
6,Books for the next 1-2 weeks: https://t.co/2Ox4V9Uz6I
7,@rhizomyx @joeyharris @GeorgeSilverman @logseq @obsdmd @rcvd_io haha amazing! wish i found this 2 months ago 😭
8,"@nateliason @logseq apparently they have one! (unofficial but it at least exists)

https://t.co/PQN6zCEIt4"
9,@joeyharris @logseq just jokes ser 🤷🏽‍♂️
10,"@joeyharris @GeorgeSilverman @logseq @obsdmd Logseq has a marketplace where you just install &amp; toggle a new theme.

With Roam you have to manually include the CSS in the roam/css file.

It's a combination of all these subtle differences which make a huge difference (to me).

Have you used Logseq yet?"
11,"@joeyharris @GeorgeSilverman @logseq @obsdmd Personally speaking, it feels faster/easier to set myself up with a UI that I enjoy in Logseq. There are probably more subtle differences that I haven't explicitly clarified that make it more enjoyable.

Even rearranging your fav notes in Roam vs Logseq, it's noticeably smoother"
12,"@joeyharris @GeorgeSilverman @logseq @obsdmd Lots of differences.
- There's a nice visual difference between tags, hyperlinks, and backlinks. With Roam backlinks &amp; hyperlinks look the same so you can't differentiate them.
- Icons &amp; Font
- Color scheme

Plus you can download themes much more easily with Logseq https://t.co/tdZBeAlRSz"
13,"@tjrwriting are you going to use Alchemy?

if so it should be relatively straightforward so you're fine. 

the only thing to be wary of is that since you use your private key to deploy the smart contract, make sure you remember *not* to commit that to github."
14,@teknical_ish So much regret 😭😭
15,@tjrwriting yep openzeppelin + inheritance is magical
16,@_StevenFan @TfTHacker @logseq will check this out :)
17,"@griimick @logseq I'll check this out, thanks!"
18,"@logseq Only feedback I have right now is being able to use the keyboard shortcut ""CMD + Option + 1/2/3"" to change a bullet into an H1/2/3 element.

I use that quite often in Roam &amp; Notion :)"
19,"@GeorgeSilverman @logseq @obsdmd I haven't used Obsidian yet! These may seem small, but have a huge impact for me:
- Centered omnibar (CMD + K) instead of Roam's search bar on top
- Performance speed
- Drastically better UI. Logseq is actually enjoyable to use — I hated Roam but never found a great alternative"
20,"@Loster @logseq Yep pretty much! Main notable differences for me so far are overall performance speed &amp; a better omnibar.

Given the similarities, it's easy to migrate over and have a better overall experience.

Also UI is a huge factor for me. I get *excited* to use Logseq vs the dread of Roam"
21,"I know everyone goes through this in their NFT journey, but that doesn't make it any less painful 😭 https://t.co/HHdcwRt215"
22,@andres_leonn @logseq @rem_note Oh that was also recommended to me. Will check it out :)

24,"@agctyz Something happened w Opensea and some wallets got compromised. Unclear if it was a phishing attack or an issue w the smart contract/migration.

But the hacker has stolen over $1.5M so far"
25,"Given that Etherscan &amp; revokecash are both down, two tips I've seen (I'm using option 2):

1. Create a new wallet &amp; transfer your nfts to a wallet that hasn't touched OS
2. Create a transaction w/ a 1 gwei gas fee so no other transactions can go through"
26,@_anishagnihotri @RoscoKalis prepare for this to crash soon 😂

28,@andotvu @logseq i've just been waiting to become a roam hater &amp; finally have an excuse 🙌🏽
29,"@teknical_ish @logseq yeah roam feels incredibly stagnant. haven't checked on the readwise front, but Logseq does allow for dev plugins (so maybe there is one!)

also I timed how long the apps took to launch on start up:
- Roam: 10.38s
- Logsec: 3.41s"
30,h/t @kev_esh for putting me on
31,"Ok I started using @logseq today and it's *SO* much nicer than Roam.

The UI/UX is 🤌🏽"
32,@dhof https://t.co/WlxLFqD6lI includes it!
33,@sullydoesitall lfgg 🔥
34,"5/ I just started using it today so haven't taken full advantage of Alchemy's tools yet. 

But another benefit is that you can see your transactions in the mempool (that's where transactions chill while waiting to get picked up by miners)."
35,"4/ You can do this in three steps

1. Create an Alchemy Account
2. Create a new app in Alchemy
3. Add a custom RPC to MM using the app's endpoint

This article will walk you through it step-by-step: https://t.co/HWVzwpHbqJ"
36,"3/ Alchemy gives you your own custom endpoint. One primary benefit is that your transactions get picked up much faster since you're dealing w/ less competition.

I timed my transactions to see the difference in speed:
• Default RPC: 41.34 seconds
• Alchemy RPC: 25.81 seconds"
37,2/ M*taM*sk uses a default node provider using Infura as its endpoint. That means everyone else using MM *also* has this as their default node provider.
38,"1/ Want to cut your M*taM*sk transaction times in half?

Start using @AlchemyPlatform for your node provider. Here's how:"

52,"4/ The benefit of this is that you can still add subdomains and edit the records using a hot wallet.

But if your M*t*M*sk ever gets hacked, all you need to do is use your Ledger to change the controller &amp; you're good as new."
53,"3/ The only thing you need to do is change the registrant to your hardware wallet's address, and you're good to go. https://t.co/teD6ULXxNM"
54,"2/ Your domain is comprised of a registrant &amp; controller.

• The registrant is the most important part. It has the final say over which addresses point to the controller &amp; registrant.

• The controller can edit records &amp; add subdomains."
55,"1/4 I've been seeing some wallets get hacked and lose their ENS names which scared me a bit, so I finally moved mine to my Ledger.
