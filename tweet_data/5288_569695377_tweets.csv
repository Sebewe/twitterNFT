8,@NFTDarling @louachu2 @RDM_41 Oh my gosh I’ve never been so thankful to already be married. Ryan would 100% be trying to wear BAYC merch.
9,@louachu2 @RDM_41 @NFTDarling I feel like @RDM_41 feels the same way. That seems the be the one he grabs when I say “can you at least wear something nice please???”
10,@CapetainTrippy @RDM_41 @louachu2 Like can BAYC at least do the wives a favor and release some logo button ups or something??
11,"@louachu2 @RDM_41 Not @RDM_41. Guess what he tried to wear to our fancy valentine’s dinner? That’s right, a BAYC shirt."

37,I always know @RDM_41 is up to something when he lets me take a nap. I just woke up and said “wait… you dumped how much money in to that while I was asleep??” 🤦🏻‍♀️
38,@NFTDarling @RDM_41 @louachu2 I support that. You’re worth the rest of that portfolio 👑
