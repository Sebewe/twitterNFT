1,I secretly wondered how long it'd take Axie Infinity to pivot its Ronin blockchain as a blockchain for broader P2E games and DeFi applications. Sounds like they're working on it. https://t.co/6NT7PpRVYx
2,GM to Baseball fans now almost certainly deprived of the MLB season starting on time. https://t.co/zMuPizFnS6
3,@theNFTgigi @xoxo__cait @CryptoTechWomen happy to support the project in a small way--picked one up on OS and looking forward to the public reveal!
4,"NFT's still super new and data sparse, but on balance have underperformed ETH (red bar shown as approx analog to above chart). Suffice to say--a continued 'flight to quality/safety' would likely hurt NFT's more than ETH, BTC. https://t.co/GD6uJpEhvn"
5,"Thoughts on NFT's with markets in turmoil: 
1. We're seeing flight to quality, i.e. money flowing towards safety.
2. Crypto is still super new, but based on past few days: 
BTC&gt;ETH&gt;MATIC (and other smaller coins)
3. Safest bet by far is still UST. But 'risk' in SPX' holding up. https://t.co/C6JX79uoT0"

7,@shahselbe @evanrapoport Yeah it's really unproven ground. If you're an originalist you have an argument. But it's a test of political will.

26,@DCamp12 yes (indirectly). and the process of getting one in NYC is a dumpster fire--especially if the area is otherwise desirable forget about it.

55,GM y'all. I'm feeling a little burnout from the hype trains of different NFT projects so maybe I close most of my tabs for the day and ignore the alpha channels until that fire returns. Substance always wins in the long run. Short-term price moves are statistical noise.

68,@EverydayJohn_ @NFTbark @Coinbase_NFT @LooksRareNFT It sounds to me like you guys are more or less saying the same thing. I'm with Steve here--Coinbase stands to be a game changer and sui generis. But OS and especially LR could keep some of the OG degens and build specific niches.

72,Interesting analysis on NFT wash trades--not enough to make you lose sleep at night but enough to stay frosty. They don't mention their data sources but I wonder how much of this is for $LOOKS tokens. Also Tornado Cash probably obscures most prolific wash traders. https://t.co/3uyPes1pnp
73,@JohnKicklighter PS not that you asked but crypto charts more or less beg for logarithmic scales.
74,@JohnKicklighter LOL. That's a Gartman-esque trendline right there.
75,@BeauCharles wouldn't rule it out but also not betting on it per se. the pumpers do like the low-liquidity weekends though.
76,Shaping up to be a fun weekend of trading as $ETHUSD hitting key congestion resistance (prev highs/lows) ~$2950. Still not out of the woods yet but a break higher makes me a shorter-term bull. https://t.co/sZqjBugqmU

97,@DCLBlogger I agree on the last bit especially. But with a chunk of inside knowledge I can honestly say @OnChainMonkey will stand the test of time. Too many brilliant minds and too big a network of crypto OG's for it not to.
