79,Also at @MiindedStudio we worked on few projects that got verified in minutes and before reveal… what about that @OpenSea? Favoritism?
80,"It’s hard to verify, so they don’t verify… 😒

So they verified the owner account but not the collections… 

I really don’t know what to think about that… laziness or incompetence… https://t.co/WXIq7XTHLw"
81,"I got an email from @opensea:

« However, as you know, the NFT space has exploded not only in volume but in the complexity of NFT projects. This has been very exciting for the ecosystem but has made it more challenging for us to extend verification to complex projects like yours» https://t.co/paFZoa7FpA"
