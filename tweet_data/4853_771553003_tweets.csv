4,"After spending almost 2 weeks in Denver, I have to say that it's much easier to survive the winter here in NYC because:
1. It's less cold
2. More skyscrapers to block the wind
3. If you feel too cold there are more random shops around NYC to pretend to browse in to take a break"

7,"@jaiyagill As much as I love other genres of music (I'm a bachata/reggaeton artist), have to admit that EDM does give opportunities for 5 min+ buildups and huge subs/drops that you simply cannot experience anywhere else but a club, especially over a 2 hour period. Deadmau5 party was great."

16,Not just GameFi but most of the previous SocialFi projects are also DeFi mechanics wrapped in different forms.

31,"The internet can be used for good, but it can also be used to harm people. Same for NFTs. But what most people mostly see are the luxury, out of reach, non-carbon neutral use cases of NFTs. 

We at @socol_io are not aiming to convince them, but to show them there is another side. https://t.co/3eINVEn91B"
32,@jeremytwei Switched to Linear and never looked back 🥸
33,"@j0hnwang But regarding your tweet, I feel that these abuses in power kinda reinforce the view that governance tokens are way better in the form of NFTs than fungible tokens: illiquid, easier mental model (like a membership card, one NFT = one vote), incentivised to keep at least one."
34,"@j0hnwang When you said gov power I initially thought you were talking about actual governments: I feel like governments should have some kind of age-weighted mechanism to balance out temporary gain and long term loss, which disproportionately affects the next generation of citizens."
35,@BartronPolygon @socol_io A luxury T-shirt will also eventually wear out and become worthless. NFTs are still a relatively better investment compared to luxury goods of the past.
36,"I missed the presale mint because my whitelisted address was an @argentHQ wallet, which is not supported. I love the concept of smart contract wallets, better security and user experience, but the moral of the story is to always use a Metamask wallet for whitelists and mints. https://t.co/MD7d6YXiic"
37,"@BartronPolygon @socol_io Of course. I'm not talking about investments at all. NFTs will obviously be a far better investment since it does not wear out, more money is coming in than going out, and it is easier to trade. I am just drawing the parallel between the utility of these NFTs with luxury goods."
38,"@Huzzuh1 @socol_io Hey man, appreciate the enthusiasm, but unfortunately this is something I have limited control over as the leadership has been handed over to the IreneDAO core team. I've gave them a few options, I believe they will consider and plan the next steps."
39,"The same people who ""don't understand"" why a Gucci T-shirt costs $700 also ""don't understand"" why people are buying PFPs for $100k+. People have always hated on luxury goods, the issue is that the most well known NFTs today are the luxury tier ones. 

@socol_io will change this."

51,"@lordaisus @socol_io By technology I'm referring to tools that allow web2 creators and fans to seamlessly transition over from web2 to web3: decentralised IDs, blockchain scalability, on and off ramps, etc. Good tech will eventually feel invisible to the end user, and web3 will be strictly superior."
52,"@lordaisus Hey @lordaisus, thanks for sharing this, great write-up. This is the thesis that we were trying to prove at @socol_io, which why we launched IreneDAO as a proof of concept. One thing that is very important for this revolution is technology: which is what we have been focusing on."

66,"@whizwang @DakotaAnderson8 @socol_io @Irenezhao_ Thanks @whizwang. For the record, @Irenezhao_ writes her own tweets. Some people just have a hard time admitting that someone can be both good-looking and intelligent (and that some people are bilingual)."
67,@NicoleBehnam How about @Irenezhao_?
68,"@nonfungibletc @socol_io @Irenezhao_ Sure, but honestly I think you should feature @Irenezhao_ instead."
69,@JaysonCrypto @Irenezhao_ @0xIreneDao @socol_io Thanks for the support sir! Glad that you share our vision :)
70,RT @Irenezhao_: 2016… 😂😂😂 https://t.co/SZRDD5aSGR
71,@DakotaAnderson8 @socol_io @Irenezhao_ It's incredible that you guys would rather believe all kinds of crazy theories that admit that @Irenezhao_ can be simultaneously good-looking and extremely intelligent.
72,"We're only just getting started in our push to build the future of the creator economy. We are super excited for what coming up ahead. If you are interested in what we're doing, please contact us at @socol_io."
73,"Thank you everyone who has read until this far, and for everyone who has supported us in the journey (especially our friends over at @0xIreneDAO)."
74,"From what we've learnt from IreneDAO, sometimes the best ideas come from the serendipitous moments, and we want to empower communities to capture this magic."
75,"All premium collectable holders get to discuss, initiate, and vote on proposals from directly within the platform. They also get to communicate directly with the creator."
76,"As the market cap of a creator's premium collectable collection increases, the quota of premium collectables that the creator can mint increases."
77,"Along with the premium collectables is a community DAO: the creator earns from the primary sale, but DAO receives all royalties on secondary sales, to be spent on initiatives by the community."
78,"Premium collectables can be anything the creator wants it to be: photos, videos, 3d objects, etc. Creators get to be the creative director of their own NFT collection."
79,"Premium collectables, on the other hand, are similar to the IreneDAO passes we created. They are priced via an auction-based model and grant access to the creator's inner circle."
80,Or you might be able to spend 1 collectable to appear on a creator's livestream. It is up to the creator to decide how they want to monetise.
81,"A creator might set a subscription of 3 social collectables per month for for access to exclusive content, similar to OnlyFans."
82,"These social collectables then serve as a form of currency within the creator's community, you can choose to spend your collectable, or keep it in your collection."
83,"Social collectables are priced at 10 USD/USDC and can be bought individually or as a pack, with the underlying social collectables only revealed after purchase."
84,"Social collectables are like trading cards, and each one of them contains a piece of social content from the pool with a unique serial number and signature."
85,"When creators connect their social accounts, all of their social media content (e.g. posts, tweets, videos) are added to a pool of content."
86,"There are two main types of collectables on our platform: social collectables (where we get our name from), and premium collectables."
87,"Bridging social accounts also helps to solve the problem of reserved usernames: on SO-COL, you can only use a username from a connected account or your ENS domain."
88,The DID serves as a proof that the user of a certain social media account is also the owner of a crypto wallet. Dynamically generated DIDs can also be embedded in NFT metadata.
89,"Instead of getting creators to start from scratch, we allow them to bridge their existing social accounts over through our decentralised ID (DID) protocol."
90,How can creators start their communities on SO-COL? It's very simple: creators only need to connect their social media accounts in order to get started.
91,"Of course, there are strong benefits to learning how blockchain technologies works, just like learning how the internet or the banking system works."
92,"Likewise, I believe that users should not need to understand how the blockchain and NFTs work to reap the benefits of these technologies."
93,"Not many people ask about what technologies power Twitter, we just know it's easy for users to login to browse and post tweets."
94,"The key thing is that even for a first time crypto user, they do not need to understand anything about blockchain technologies in order to use our platform."
95,"Users can pay using their credit cards or with USDC, and users can choose to keep their NFTs on our layer 2, or withdraw them to another L1 blockchain."
96,"This will greatly improve the efficiency of minting NFTs, making it accessible to more users. Users will pay a significantly lower fee to mint their NFTs, priced in USD/USDC."
97,"To improve the minting experience for users, we are working with @StarkWareLtd to deploy our own instance of StarkEx, an L2 scalability engine on Ethereum."
98,"Of course, we have to pay gas fees to mint NFTs on the blockchain. Gas fees on Ethereum are currently very high, and can be prohibitive for many users."
99,"Most creators are not traders, and most of them would prefer receiving a stable, recurring income. This is why our entire platform runs on USD and USDC."
