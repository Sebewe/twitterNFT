26,"@Verite • How can we incorporate our Guestbook into Verifiable Memorabilia?
• Can we build fan experiences into the history of a concert outfit?
• What do digi-physical signatures look like?"
27,"@Verite We believe the concept of ""verifiable memorabilia"" is actually just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the possibilities unlocked by bringing provenance to physical items. As we explore what’s possible, we’re looking to answer questions like:"
28,@Verite This on-chain provenance allows us to unify our digital &amp; physical identities. verite.eth contains @Verite's entire story in web3 from mint #411 on Zora to fractionalizing “he’s not you”. And now we can add her outfit from the music video to her web3 history.
29,"@Verite In our case, the jacket NFT is currently owned by verite.eth who has possession of the jacket today. The auction winner will be able to claim the NFT upon delivery of the jacket. The history of everyone who had proximity to the jacket will live with the garment itself."
30,"@Verite By permanently linking an NFT to a garment, we no longer need to rely on black-box ""photo matching"" in order to know who owned the jacket. The only way to own the linked NFT is to scan the embedded NFC chip, allowing the scanner to pull the NFT into their own wallet."
31,"@Verite Currently, historic garments are independently verified by trusted parties. E.g. Sotheby's is auctioning off a shirt Kobe wore during his 81 point game which has been ""authenticated and photo-matched by The MeiGray Group, the NBA’s official authenticator""

https://t.co/HUQuzqA3P9"
32,"Today, we're auctioning off @Verite's jacket worn in her ""he's not you"" music video. The jacket is permanently linked to an NFT (the music video itself) and is the first ever publicly verifiable piece of memorabilia.

What do we mean by Verifiable Memorabilia? 👇 https://t.co/ptKpE6aOOR"

86,@neocho_ thank youu!!
87,thanks for reading and we plan to expand on these concepts in a blog post in the near future! ❤️
88,we believe the idea space is HUGE &amp; are excited to continue to push the boundaries of what's possible. note this is an example of a completely utility-based use case of NFTs where ultimately the tech doesnt matter. it's about what additional value you get for going to a show.
89,"we're only scratching the surface of how NFTs can be used as a base layer to power novel direct-to-fan experiences. At IYK*, we're tokenizing IRL behaviors and building the tooling on top of the tokens so that anyone can facilitate these types of value systems for THEMSELVES."
90,"@Verite commissioned a beautifully produced video showing behind-the-scenes soundcheck footage of her hit ""By Now"". currently, the footage is available for all to view. but you can imagine exclusive concert-specific content being gated to only attendees in the future."
91,"the gallery is an experiment in exploring how to deliver more VALUE to concert attendees by tiering the fan experience. everyone is free to view the gallery but commenting is GATED by Guestbook token ownership.

https://t.co/kUU6IODo9i"
92,"this past fall, we partnered w/ @Verite to democratize attendance data to her shows. By using our NFC-based IYK* tags, we were able to memorialize attendance to her shows ON-CHAIN. these tokens are a NEW PRIMITIVE and can be used to reward fans.

https://t.co/4frW98E67a"
93,"Today, we're excited to announce the launch of Guestbook Gallery! the gallery builds on top of the Guestbook Token &amp; explores a novel way an artist can reward and engage w/ concert attendees AFTER the show is over using web3.
