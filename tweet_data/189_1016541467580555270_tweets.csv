Bullish on both"
1,@DoodlePUFFPUFF @3landersNFT Don’t even get me started on Doodles price predictions
2,@xnfts @lankaa_ @3landersNFT Ape up from the nape up✊😓 https://t.co/ZWM05q40MW
3,@lankaa_ @3landersNFT Now that goes hard🤟😓
4,@flywheelfund @3landersNFT 😂hey I’ve been known to own the most volatile NFT’s in the space!
5,I’m usually never wrong on these things please follow for more Web3 advice #iffollowif
6,"Screenshot this tweet and we’ll see if I’m wrong but…

In one month from now @3landersNFT will be at 3 eth floor. Or possibly 4 eth. Maybe even 5 eth. Or maybe 2 eth. Possibly under 2 eth. Maybe even around 1 eth. Or even under 1 eth.

I just have a gut feeling…"

14,"@theterpyone Just caught up with your concerns in the Discord. While I tend to agree with the reasoning for not allowing you to modify traits, I think the discussion was handled rather poorly. 

I appreciate you standing out and speaking up, despite the pushback. I hope you stick with IF!🤝"
15,"@BOBO21457474 @InvsbleFriends Love the stogie and the fishing rod😂. Very cool IF, brother!"
16,"@MotionMarkus Splittin’ Logs and Tossin’ Lobs! Love the artwork, Magnus!

Gn much love I will see yall tomorrow morning🤟"
18,"@hipstereth I’m sorry that the initial launch didn’t pan out as you hoped. 

Still, to try and fall short is better than never trying at all! I’m sure you learned a great bit along the way. Don’t give up, I know you can bounce back✊"
19,"@___walkingL @InvsbleFriends Good day, my fellow IF"
20,"RT @FlurETH: 110 eth sale on one of the 1/1 invisible friends just happened

24,"@smcanale #2117 and #3819, I'm dying to join!"
25,"I'm going to have an Invisible House and an Invisible Girlfriend pretty soon if this floor keeps dropping😂.

All jokes, with the limited supply and upcoming artist collaborations I think we'll see a reversal on IF pretty soon.

Hey, at least Space Doodles drop today!"

38,"Small, meaningless gesture, but still gotta show my support for @Ukraine in the arena😤 https://t.co/7WrzI80UKE"
39,"I gotta say that @StarcatchersNFT did a great job of under promising and over delivering.

They revealed 3 hours ahead of schedule (with proper notice) and added animations to the release that were never initially advertised. 

Bullish."
40,"@StarcatchersNFT You guys CRUSHED this art! 

So glad to be a part of this community. If you're a Starcatcher and we don't follow eachother, let's change that! https://t.co/xjmmB9A6XT"
41,@fleeb_eth @StarcatchersNFT Congrats! That one is awesome!
42,"And if you get a chance, read his wikipedia page. Truly unbelievable story of how he came to leadership.

https://t.co/w26n27A2BX"
43,"Ukraine’s President #Zelenskiy is a certified badass. Staying and fighting with his people while Russia has a target on his head.

Praying for the safety of this man and all of Ukraine as he continues to lead them through these extraordinarily difficult times. https://t.co/JgvrtXV9R8"
44,"@0xromeus WorldWide Webb has made some really nice developments lately, they are constantly producing. 

Not a BC, but I think a good lower-risk play is Starcatchers. Their team is really solid.

Just my opinions, so DYOR! What projects have caught your eye lately?"
45,@hollywoodClutch @3landersNFT The people are dying to know… when will THE Hollywood Clutch join 3Land!?

50,"I’m lost… could somebody help me find my @InvsbleFriends? 

Trying to follow back as many #InvisibleFriends as I can by the end of the week!😈 https://t.co/yGkmMpQuVL"
51,@TheEillusion @InvsbleFriends Best of luck on reveal! Tho i’m sure we’ll be pleased with whatever we get
52,@TheEillusion @InvsbleFriends Nice to meet you!!!
53,Unintentional pro (or maybe a con?) for more complex animated projects like @InvsbleFriends; all derivates will look like dog sh*t😂 https://t.co/SHS3DAfEbu
54,Bags drop for like 12 hours and all of the haters emerge to have a field day on twitter😂
55,"While I agree that some of the FUD for @InvsbleFriends is valid, are people forgetting that there is just a 5k supply?

Halve the value of whatever 10k project you’re comparing it to, and then reanalyze. I think the 8-10 eth buys are completely justified here. Just my opinion."
56,Praying for the safety of everyone in Ukraine🙏
57,RT @madmodcars: The team at @AnimoNFT gave us a sneak preview into the building blocks of the upcoming game. I did not expect this level of…

75,@InvsbleFriends They have a lil membrane around them and some internal organs/bones! They also have the blue beanie with the X and a pencil! Maybe that is the artists go-to IRL accessory?

80,"I genuinely love the Azuki artwork, but I am still amazed at how fast they’ve grown. Am I missing something? Is their a functionality for the holders that is creating the value?

Either way, I am happy for all my Azuki holder friends! Keep pushing!"
81,@InvsbleFriends It would get my jimmies rattled
82,If you dropped alpha or helped your normie friends get WL on a project just so they could get into NFT's... that's🅿️

99,"@LukieMotion Not sure, I think it’s only available to stream. 

Cast is full of stars. Setlist is hits. Visuals were great. Story was pretty enticing. I loved Sing 1 and IMO Sing 2 was even better."
