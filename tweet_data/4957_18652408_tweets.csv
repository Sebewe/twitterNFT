5,@mysavagedogs well damn i'm hype...
6,"RT @Loopifyyy: 14/ This is bad. The market needs a fresh reset.

This is unsustainable... people are losing a lot of money already... and t…"
7,"@Nft_Big10 who knows, but i think we can see the signs that dark times are ahead because of the amount of scamming, rugging, and runaway valuations of baseless projects. this cannot continue forever without a ""great reset"" https://t.co/mkohgH4umQ"
8,Your critical digest today. Mandatory reading 🔎 https://t.co/vne69kieu8
9,@en0tsNFT Our collection is designed to grow as our community does. Best of both worlds.
10,@SCHMIREK bahahah
11,"absolutely nothing against 10k project gang, but i sure am glad we did 1k with habibis.

it was the absolute right call for us."
12,"@ange888lover @Crypto_Mizz i don't know what to say, habibi. never ever put money that you need (rent, food, debt, etc) in any of this stuff. never ever. never. do not do it.

don't."
13,@betty_nft this has been getting to me recently 🤦‍♂️. just a habibi with a keyboard over here.
14,"@boycottvillage Thank you for summoning LL, my spirit animal"
15,@boycottvillage @props hahahah
16,"Honored to be a part of the @props ecosystem. We have deep conviction about what we're building at Habibis, and we believe that we're on the front line of what pfps can become. Thanks Coinski 🫂 https://t.co/dEkrlbdGRm"
17,"RT @bitcoinski: The goal for pfp projects is clear, but I’m convinced there only a few of us that see what it is. When we unleash our partn…"
18,"@Crypto_Mizz Yeah no more betting money that you need, Habibi 🫂"
19,"@Crypto_Mizz Wait, did you spend money you needed on NFTs?"

21,@Dxminic____ @BoredApeYC flipping Punks was a massive indicator. New is “better”. F*ck provenance.
22,@afkbee @liquiddensity @yash_khan31 @0xKNNY @WGMInterfaces I think you just don’t know what a rug is.
23,"@iamlirona Full agree. I very much feel like freshman, especially when I think of the likes of @fvckrender or @Loopifyyy!"
24,💀 https://t.co/Hb8unbdhlX
25,@shakkablood looooool peeps are getting rugged left and right.
26,Couldn't even get your own mint pass art? https://t.co/CoJi64N9oj https://t.co/dZGTswReJO
27,@Janks_NFT @NewFriendsNFT @Habibis_NFT LOL
28,"@Topaz_Crypt I think the WGMI medium article might have been a really kind way of saying ""this space is a sh*t show right now and we don't wanna be a part of it"""
29,"@HDergler i definitely feel you on the ""OG phases"", hope we get another one soon!"
30,@MotionsNft on paper that sounds dope.
31,@shakkablood down.
32,"[].[] 

I feel obligated to weigh in and shill that habibis have been here since March 2021, and we'll be here after [insert-rug-project-here] dies."
33,"🔍So what's next? I have *no* clue. But my hunch tells me this cannot go on forever. It just can't.

Tell me what you think."
34,"💊 collectors are buying into clearly-rug projects, thinking they can get out before other suckers can, and make a profit (esp. scary)

💊 many ""older"" projects with provenance and incredible+active founders are struggling compared to new projects with zero credibility."
35,"here's the hardest pill to swallow--we mostly deserve this:

💊 collector hivemind only wants the newest thing, old projects (over one-month-old) are ""out""
💊 provenance and integrity are not proven or valued in these new projects

(cont'd)"
36,"feels like we're hitting a critical mass of disbelief here. and i think it's deserved, too. in the past 3 months we've seen:

❌ projects collapse under extreme hype
❌ reveals that don't match promised art
❌ incompetent staff with no real-world experience"
37,"avatar🧵: timeline is slowly accumulating with extremely negative sentiment for avatar projects:

❌ people are being rugged
❌ art is being stolen
❌ promises are not being kept"
38,"i love you all and i pride myself on being able to work through all my DMs, but i just need a little bit of time for me 🫂"

43,@RoboRamenNFT Well this is TOO COOL.
44,@fbspin 🥈
45,"@ange888lover Honestly I have no clue what short term looks like right now.

My best guess is we’re sideways in crypto for a few months which means NFTs could continue making big moves."
46,"@mubarak_marafa They have, I’ve noticed. People are getting rugged left and right.

Lots of Artist vs. Artist drama.

Lots of Collector vs. Artist too.

Also people being rightfully and wrongfully cancelled."
47,"I’m not fixing this type-o 😤

Star or Leave? 💪"
48,@TileshStashie 🥇
49,"Lots of people lost their appetite and left NFTs in April/May 2021 when NFTs took a noticeable dip.

Will you star or leave when the next dip comes?"
50,"@mysavagedogs 100e floor on dogface isn’t news dawg. lemme know when 1,000e floor."

67,Sorry but I’m not incorruptible. https://t.co/F5dog6LiiE
68,@alphadoggg_ 🚨
69,@RagsNFT Think that’s a COP honestly.
70,@heyhaigh Thanks yo. We need it today.
71,@mondoggg 100% I'm with you. I think it's time for a mega-thread to be honest. But wanna let the news take the focus today. Maybe next week.
72,"@mondoggg (almost finished!) However, the cons of charging 5e with be a hilarious amount of hate on twitter."
73,"@mondoggg The pros of charging 5e would have been it force people to value the project more accurately. Lots of flippers who got WL for making a video, or a drawing, or just a simple giveaway will drive price down cause their cost basis is essentially 0.25e."
74,"@mondoggg Gosh. this is so tricky. I think the reality is that with hyped-up projects, there is no way that will satisfy the masses because so many people aren't able to participate.

(cont'd)"
75,@turkatronn @exorcist3d THAT’S A GREAT IDEA 💡
76,"@exorcist3d Me too. Certainly will be efforts to aid that we can contribute to, but I feel the same as you."

88,@indiaweston Gm!
89,"@MuchAlec Just for reference, Habibis has charity drops planned and that’s how we’ll be doing it."
90,@MuchAlec I’d personally like to see holders vote on where it goes. Hopefully that’s the plan.
91,"@MuchAlec It’s a lot of money that needs to be managed correctly, even if it’s going to charity. Inshallah they manage it well."
92,"@boycottvillage @__weesh__ For me it was listening to ppl say “don’t worry the president doesn’t really have any impact over our day-to-day” and then watching friends die and other friends be arrested and deported by ICE.

What a lie."
93,"@FungibleFool I have a lot to say, so much that I think a thread is warranted.

But my TLDR will be: IF has made some errors, but most of the FUD is unwarranted.

Let’s see how the next week goes."
94,@__weesh__ When your “politics” is someone else’s survival that’s when you know you are highly privileged 🤝
95,"@__weesh__ ABSOLUTELY F*CKING RIGHT 👏🏽

Weesh I’m so proud to be your friend."
96,"1.3m to charity isn’t the worst way to kick off a collection. let’s see what happens.
