10,@Icybeamer @10101001k @TheRegularsNFT Regulars art is uncannily similar to ours and the discord also has clear resemblance. Unfortunately it is unclear to me if Regulars is the same former team (Joody / Kiwi). I will definitely be watching that project unfold and any comments @NFTethics has to make about them.
11,@ApeKidGoneNaked Releasing specifics on the process this week. Absolutely no problem that you may have multiple in same wallet.
12,"9/I’m always looking forward to the future. I know you are going to love defending your Free Guys just as much as I will love issuing the rulings on your defenses. I love you all and appreciate the support I have from all of you.

13,8/It is clear to the community and me what went wrong: lack of transparency and empty promise after empty promise. I like transparency. I dislike empty promises. Let the past be nothing but a blemish on our journey together.
14,"7/Next event. With Kiwi’s assistance (kudos to Kiwi), I was able to create a new wallet and have all of the funds in the wallet Joody controlled sent over (kudos to Joody for sending over the ETH). Additionally, I was able to change the royalty address: https://t.co/NLB7pqVkR3"
15,"6/Walking away when times are tough is not the answer. The answer is doubling down. It was clear what I needed to do. I needed to secure the wallet and the funds, and continue to grow and build as if this blemish never even happened. I am happy to say that is exactly what I did."
16,"5/Brian, who Joody claimed would take over the project, has been pretty quiet the days following that announcement, with no signs of him taking control over the project + funds. This did not sit well with me."
17,"4/Next event. Joody dropped the MOAB: Although mental health is no joke, it was obvious that Joody was trying to walk away from what was created. This left me, Ole Hickory, alone to take the backlash from the community. https://t.co/MeAWUJWNA2"
18,3/I had no idea the founders (Joody / Kiwi) had connections to these suspicious projects. I did what anyone would do in my position: contact @nftethics to learn more. I appreciate the  conversations and advice @nftethics gave me. They‘re a positive force needed in the space.
19,"2/The events that have taken place in our short 3 week life are no secret. Let’s start with the @nftethics post: https://t.co/lSY7pNWmE5 Like many members in our community, I was shocked when I saw this post sent in the general chat."
20,"1/Hey frens. Ole Hickory here. Before I get into the thick of it, let’s explain how it all started for me. I was originally the moderator for Free Guys. I was thrilled to get this offer from the former founders. I’ve made great memories with everyone in the courtroom. Y’all rock."
