11,@_Raster_Eyes_ @farokh Didn't he sweep the 104 near a 80 eth floor? I'd think he'd need to get closer to 25m to make a profit
12,"@blkafgang @0x650d He would owe the hammer fee for the average of the estimated value (so ~%18 of 25M). Idk if they can compell him, but he would have signed documents and also doxxed himself to Sotheby's to get to the point where the punks were being auctioned."

17,"@GencoLaw @larvalabs There are no royalties which @larvalabs has implemented, not with punks, autoglyphs, or meebits. - this is part of the innovation and vision of punks. The simple reason why @bayc has a royalty is money. Yes, the punk contract is open source and has been for approaching 5 years."
18,@0xTycoon @sillytuna @GuidoDisalle Aye there's the rub. Education and diminishing ignorance on the subject is the worthwhile push imo.
19,Wise words - but if you have granted permission to your wallet for the OS migration you do need to act and revoke them. The issue appears to be with the new OS contract. https://t.co/PNTNLyPP9Z

40,@omz_nft @scott_lew_is @justintrimble @WRabbit1111 And so we wait...until something changes
41,"@omz_nft @scott_lew_is @justintrimble @WRabbit1111 I do embrace that sentiment in general, inaction is a great move sometimes. But inaction is also *an* action. Learned this from some past relationships...inaction does matter, and is a choice."
42,"@beeple looks rare, wen mint?"
43,@omz_nft @scott_lew_is @justintrimble @WRabbit1111 We can only hope they choose to control the narrative with such an action.
44,@omz_nft @scott_lew_is @justintrimble @WRabbit1111 I suspect the problem there comes from the fact both contracts contain the hash of the 10k punk image to point to it.
45,"@scott_lew_is @justintrimble @WRabbit1111 We can hope that as time goes on,and people understand this space better,that they end up occupying the right place,as a progenitor, and a spark that wasn't quite the flame that cryptopunks are. In effect, without a functional native market, they don't fulfill the vision of Punks"
46,"@scott_lew_is @justintrimble @WRabbit1111 I absolutely agree there should be no ambiguity in that it's a bugged token. The token descriptor on OS/LR mentions this, but it may not be explicit enough (especially in this market). Personally I have zero interest in misrepresenting any v1 I sale to any buyer (or their buyer)"
47,"@scott_lew_is @justintrimble @WRabbit1111 Peddling 1 of 2 art tokens, one fully expressed &amp; 1 a sketch, a misprint or re-do. If it was the same there would only be one token. Its the world we accepted when we embraced the blockchain, and regardless of my bias no amount of re-conception removes the token, thats the point."
48,"@justintrimble @WRabbit1111 @scott_lew_is It will be be discussed in classrooms for generations I expect. - Thank you ser, you helped keep my spirits up on this journey to arrive at this unexpected place. I hope I'm there to congratulate you in a few years at your next peak as well!"
49,"@0xfoobar @justintrimble @WRabbit1111 @scott_lew_is As I understand it, @Meta4Capital was very happy about things, and the DMCA was part of their thesis in that v1s are ""forbidden fruit"", so to them it only made it more valuable in their investment approach."
50,"@justintrimble @WRabbit1111 @scott_lew_is In the end, I think shit is fertilizer,which can make things flourish. It's just a matter of perspective.There is opportunity to capture the narrative to the benefit of all punks, though the ambiguity from the creators has made that difficult to find confluence. Perhaps its on us"
51,"@justintrimble @WRabbit1111 @scott_lew_is I've tried to act in the best way for the community, and asked opinions from the punk community on what to do with the v1s, as well as LL directly. The community said resoundingly, if they have value sell them. LL said nothing. After LL sold I sold a v1 alien for 1k - gonzo times"
52,"@justintrimble @WRabbit1111 @scott_lew_is I had to condense that to fit it into a tweet, there is a lot more - but I agree it isn't simple particularly in this medium. And especially with them being at the very forefront of the entire space."
53,"@justintrimble @WRabbit1111 @scott_lew_is I agree and disagree (biased), both contracts have the hash of the punk image to bind the images to tokens. Both from official LL address &amp; v1s were official punks until it was decided to abandon them but now they have been salvaged.LL said it was out of their hands when v1 began"
54,"@scott_lew_is It was LL that coined v1 as a term, but things have become more complicated since then. I suppose it may come down to how much our decentralized community has control and narrative over it vs creators."
55,"@justintrimble @0xTjo @WRabbit1111 @scott_lew_is Yes, I still have 4, so my opinion will never be unbiased as much as I'd like to approach a clear way of thinking about this."
56,"@justintrimble @WRabbit1111 @scott_lew_is I think we should all care about this, the provenance of historical value includes previous collectors to the beginning. But because this is on the blockchain, v1s will never go away, so narrative is important to understand and frame whatever it will end up being as well."
57,@0xTjo @justintrimble @WRabbit1111 @scott_lew_is Like a Renaissance master's painting painted over a previous master's painting. Except now they can be two separate things - both have their own facets of abstractions but that's the nature of being native in this new space as well.
58,"@justintrimble @WRabbit1111 @scott_lew_is It is absolutely a complicated one - ultimately I don't think it will be a harmful thing, but I cannot remove my bias either. I think this is the nature of such experiments...unexpected outcomes are part and parcel, and where we end up are not where we thought we were going."
59,@justintrimble @WRabbit1111 @scott_lew_is Art and the stories artists create have a way of out-growing intent. This may be why art from dead artists command more value; they can not longer affect it &amp; the story is then only written by the collectors. Blockchain is a hybrid of this by making it immutable despite intention
