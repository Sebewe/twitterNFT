79,@parvizmayelzade Unrelated sir. The layer2 solutions are the path to low gas fees. ETH2 gas fees will be the same.
80,@isaacculli1 ETH2 will not affect gas prices! We need all the L2s for that.

82,@SHIBkryptonian Hi there please be aware that gas fees will be the same post merge! Layer 2 solutions are coming to solve gas.
83,@RRT2032 Hey there please know that post merge gas fees will be the same! It’s layer2 that solves the gas problem.. solutions are coming!
84,"@VaIarhash ETH2 won’t reduce gas fees, it’s layer 2 solutions that will."
85,@JimmyT_NFTs @CryptoDadsNFT Layer2 solutions are coming hold tight. Note that ETH2 isn’t gonna make gas cheaper.
86,@terramoongroup @ethereum Hey please note gas fees will be unaffected by ETH2- seems to be a common misconception. It’s layer2 solutions that will solve it
87,@NFTSpaceMonkeys Hi - please be aware gas fees won’t be any lower on ETH2 - you need to look  at layer 2 solutions for that. Gas gets you a spot on the block. All about demand.
88,@cryptocoinkid1 Know that ETH2 will not lower gas fees ! That’s what layer2s are for.
