1,"It will be interesting to see how brands continue to enter the space. As of now, I'm betting on native Web3 brands like @AzukiZen, @RTFKTstudios, @BossBeautiesNFT, @JaduHologram  to be the brands we'll want to associate ourselves as the space continues to evolve. https://t.co/vvyl7HQwd1"

8,"We were born in Venezuela. On one side of our family, we experienced western privilege. The other side - poverty, disadvantage, how impossible it feels to change your circumstance, how lucky we were to fall on the other side. The guilt of privilege in the face of family, of love."
9,"Reader, this founder is my brother. I have a lucrative job in an industry I mostly love... But in him I see a visionary daring to build a model that will innovate, take advantage of new tech, the underlying mission to reinvent economic inequality."
10,"I spoke to a dear founder yesterday who admitted his exhaustion, how taxing it is to build in this space of innovation, hope, non-stop speed, often cruelty. But he remembered the goal: how we are on the verge of a redistribution of wealth, the great equalizer, his north star."
11,"Every once in a while I stop and wonder how I got to a place in my life where I'm paying thousands of dollars for jpgs... but then I remember I'm investing in brands, companies -- dreams for the future and the people behind them..."

18,"@GalenDriver I feel the exact same way! Every time I watch TV with my 2yo my husband and I are like, “oh that looks like ___ that I just minted.” Someone needs to write an essay about this. Turns out we never let go of the desire to “play?” What would Freud say? @TheAtlantic, help!"

27,"As a parent it can often feel like life is a monotonous grind of endless responsibility while your child wakes to a world of endless possibility. 

The gift of web3 is that we become the child too. Explore, build, have the audacity to dream -- that is all that is expected of you."

39,@SmokeDetect Terrifying. Would love to figure out a way to support her.
40,@QuiteBrazen Larger philosophical conversation that I am constantly grappling with. Lines of ethics/safety/decentralization are murky right now. I don't want web3 to be niche. I hope it becomes widely adoptable. I tend to respect what looksrare is doing. Just can't personally take on the risk
41,@bitcoinsvendor It was part of that big phishing scam that happened over the weekend. The guy who had it stolen from him was very vocal about it. I believe him.
42,"@Santan3iz you are so sweet, keep your money!!!!"
43,"@bitcoinsvendor @CuriousExplor20 @rpnickson I really love the idea and the caring thought behind it, but don't want anybody else to pay for my mistakes. I should have looked into every token I was eyeing on various marketplaces. With the floor dipping I moved too quickly to buy."
44,@ZachSpaded @AzukiZen Hi @ZachSpaded ... I by mistake just bought a stolen Azuki on looks rare (officially done with that marketplace...) Any way you want to buy it from me at a discount so we can get it back to its rightful owner?
45,"@smittyleague Yes, but I also don't want to unwittingly screw over another looksrare shopper and have them in my current situation. It's marked on OS as suspicious (as it should be.)"
46,@gdillo_ @rpnickson my ego for buying an azuki? 🥺🥺 it was one i had earmarked as a gift for my two year old son... i was like in ten years he's going to think i'm reeeeal cool lol

72,The @WomenTribe_nfts reveal went so well!! How gorgeous are these??? https://t.co/LBeGlopMc5
73,@jaimeschmidt My instinct is to go bootstrap (I’m a writer/showrunner IRL and the idea of being able to follow the team’s instincts rather than “the bank’s” is super appealing to me rn) but it would solve a lot of problems to have said bank to pull from! So helpful to hear this perspective

97,For my MV3followers... The Wiz was partially inspired by a prominent person... so far I haven't seen anyone name him! (Most characters you've met have drawn inspiration from either a real or fictional character... you guys have figured it out with a couple... but not The Wiz...)
