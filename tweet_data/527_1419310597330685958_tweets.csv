Feel lucky to have won, @boredApeCOMIC is one of my favorite projects. https://t.co/Kl58d4IuTH"
7,@Xmarixamx Sorry not sorry lol. 😄
8,@ape6743 What is there even to do there anyway.
9,@peerfan @TheBlazedApe niiiiiiice
10,"@SeeDarkk For me it’s opportunity cost. My $BTC is in $ETH, both will perform well, one will perform better."
11,@Squirrely3397 @BoredApeYC @BYOPills I won’t be doing that but admire your conviction.
12,@lifestylearb @boredApeCOMIC @ValiantNFT also grabbed a season's pass. 😎
13,"@lifestylearb @boredApeCOMIC @ValiantNFT Wow a prism, that's a 1/10 rarity, congrats on the pick up. I originally minted a silver last summer, and then after reading the comic and learning about the team, I picked up a holofoil along with a few others, then another holofoil after the $BAC announcement."
14,"RT @pranksy: I hope this is the top of #NFT minting FOMO, this is just providing free targets for so many press outlets and individuals to…"
15,"@BAYC5518 Probably, but I already decided I’m keeping mine for the foreseeable future. Made my decision at 100 ETH so won’t be selling below that."
16,"Probably don't sleep on @boredApeCOMIC 

Upcoming Mint/Burn token mechanics, upcoming second issue, actual great story, actual compelling art, and now a partnership with @ValiantNFT.

Floor &lt;0.05?

Wake up folks. ☕️

And yes, my bags are packed. https://t.co/1ZB8wRKHVJ"

39.9% of you are right.  Congratulations!

SWIFT is a banking industry consortium messaging system

The banks tr…"
19,@fewture @punk6529 Ripple wishes. That’s their original idea. Same with Stellar. Whether or not SWIFT would adopt either remains to be seen (I personally doubt it).
20,"@LucasTodeschin2 @mcwise50 @punk6529 That pretty much sums it up, doesn’t it."
21,@ape_g4ng @carsonturner Must be the 3D glasses. 🟦🟥

26,"RT @VitalikButerin: Reminder: Ethereum is neutral, but I am not."
27,"@NizzyNFT stiiiiiillllll staking, and even sold a few things on the platform recently, but it doesn't stop my eyes from bleeding when I see that chart."
28,@the_freightrain @fasteddiegloor Now that is conviction. 🤔
29,@Drucritt @the_freightrain @fasteddiegloor It's almost back to what we paid to mint. Dark times.
30,"@rexwub Yeah I doubled up at 3.38, kind of regretting that, but it was a small play."
31,@the_freightrain @fasteddiegloor I’m … just going to hodl this one.
32,@the_freightrain @fasteddiegloor 😅 https://t.co/1KNGuTF3EU
33,"@ivomartins @drewcoffman Because they missed the boat, so then they doubled down, then tripled down, it can’t go on for too much longer."
34,@NFT_Shooter It’s an easy target provided you don’t sweat the details.
35,@BlueBadger2600 Cut back on accidents. Don’t leave the house.
36,@FncyI Seems reasonable.
37,@cur8orofearth @MoonlingsNFT @pixelvault_ Secured two spots.
38,@NizzyNFT I ended up trading mine for ETH and then I ended up trading quite a bit of that for NFTs.
39,@richerd Do it near the heat death of the universe so all the servers can run nice and cold.
40,Great insight into professional development as it relates to web3 (spoiler: it’s not about web3) and landing a position at @pixelvault_. Have a listen. 👇 https://t.co/elARAWfOoH
41,"@punk7635 ah, I see where you are coming from."
42,@punk7635 I honestly don’t have the inclination to do that.

46,@MrBones6645 @niftytailor @paperdstudio this shall be an insane time.
47,@BrianRoemmele Almost everything in that photo is made of trees. That's a whole lot of tree tech.
48,"@Carlini8N @PurrnelopesCC Don't forget @Frogland_io where ""1 frog = 1 land"", they will also be hosting @GutterCatGang and @WickedCraniums."
49,GM. This thread will probably have all the metaverse alpha you need at this particular moment in time. https://t.co/IkFGyNxWKg

52,@zscuffed I held a whole bitcoin for years and sold it after I discovered DeFi and NFTs.
53,@outerlumen @meta4ickal You mutants look so good behind the microphone. 🎙
54,@the_freightrain Makes for good bedtime reading. Bad call… good call… 💤
55,@the_freightrain Why would you…. Print that?
56,@scottwa23282559 @cryptovoxels Would way sooner just trust the team to execute for now.
57,"@BronekKozicki @richburroughs OpenSea only gets access to collections you approve. 

You are supposed to have a “hot” wallet where you list, and a “cold” wallet for holding, with no approvals ever. Want to sell an NFT from your cold wallet? Transfer it out first."
58,@Carlini8N @PurrnelopesCC Hardware wallets primary function: To make you rummage around and click buttons long enough to realize you might be falling for a scam.
59,@dashu1208 @bitpixi In their discord. Official land cap announcement of 70k parcels along with a Trello board of other roadmap items.

62,@fasteddiegloor @RDM_41 In order to gain that understanding you have to ask questions.
63,"Including a unique ""anti-fishing word"" in every email, should cut back on some of the spam, like we saw with @opensea yesterday. But let's just be clear: do not confirm web3 from email. https://t.co/moN6nHnklH"
64,@zeeenng false alarm: https://t.co/CqyTtjzZNE
65,@bitpixi 🌭🌭🌭 https://t.co/vzYSI6tIia
66,"@faderjoes @mitkopitko7 @lifestylearb I'm just going to go with you on this one. Bottom line, don't go directly from email to web3 😅"
67,"@mitkopitko7 @lifestylearb The blue field shows up when your ledger needs to connect.  Ledger even recommends blind signing as long as you are aware of the risks so “everything works properly”.

68,@NizzyNFT is there any legitimate reason to revoke if I'm selling items? 🤔
69,@bitpixi I will totally rock one.
70,"RT @dankvr: .@cryptovoxels has also been a testbed for tons of cool interop experiments, here's an overview 🧵"
71,@12yrold_with_cc Placed in faraday cage.
72,"@NizzyNFT I sure hope not, I claimed, staked, and didn’t revoke shit."
73,"@HougheyR Transfer your NFTs to another wallet of yours using Looksrare if you are worried. 

Also, this (though not confirmed):

74,maybe it's this https://t.co/tccDmpvWTr
75,@svvrth Me.
76,@outerlumen I’m in the same column as you! Column frens!
77,"@bitpixi I decided to stake for a while, at least until the gas is paid off both ways, then perhaps for longer. So far since 12 hours ago 1000 x2y2 is now 1037."
78,"@crysyphus They need stand up desks. Displays at eye level, hands level with the elbows, cushy mat under the feet. ✅"
79,"@jundoima @boredgentleman Eventually, yes. 🪦"
80,@HolocronApe Either way I’m here for it.
81,"@ape6743 gb, means a lot to hear you say that. https://t.co/GgDbfCO5xG"
82,"@cryptometer2 @k_monkey1520 @SpeculatorArt Yes, which is why you are supposed to set aside part of each trade for tax later, but we all know it’s easier to move to another country. 😅"
83,"@HollanderAdam my hidden folder is re-purchasing itself every single block, all epoch long."
84,@ATOK_mind @BlueBadger2600 The kind troll. I like it.
85,"@_yan_ny_ @pseudotheos Eventually you won’t know what layer you are on, just that you bought an upgrade for your infinity sword or what have you."
86,"@ATOK_mind @BlueBadger2600 Sorry had to contend with a few trolls today and must have had my guard up, all good. 😊"
87,@_miketriumph_ @BoredApeYC @FenwickWest The orange beanie is a nice touch.
88,"@ATOK_mind @BlueBadger2600 Vaporware implies there is no actual product. You can literally buy, sell and claim rewards on both platforms."
89,"@reapxrrr @PuffYatty “Humbled” “congrats” “well deserved” 

👍"
90,"@k_monkey1520 @SpeculatorArt In Canada, it’s 50% of the difference between what you sold it for and what you paid, added on top of your income, and putting you in a higher tax bracket in the process."
91,"@SpeculatorArt I also had a hard look at the option of selling my BAYC 2600. From my calculations I’d do really well, even after a big tax hit next year. 

But I can’t bring myself do it.

Congrats on the sale. I am sure it wasn’t easy."
92,@itstylersays I owe a lot 😅
93,@lifestylearb @SmolBrainsNFT @Treasure_DAO @LifeNFT_ Meanwhile I’m just happy to have bought and staked $MAGIC
94,@BoredApeSuper Should probably double it up.
95,@GaryGeck Really? That’s great. Going to check that out.
96,@BoredApeSuper I already did… at $3.38. 😅
97,@racs_o Is the project actually good? 😅
98,@basil2707 @TheHashmasks I am one of them.
