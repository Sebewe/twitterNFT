No particular order apart from release date."
74,Some background about myself. I just completed a 3 month front-end developer course. While I was doing this I discovered NFT's and made over 6 figures in profit within the last 3 months. I've began learning solidity/ethers.js/hardhat for the future of web3😃
75,"Deleted all my tweets… Going to be documenting/sharing my NFT and coding journey here.

Will also be providing my followers with some alpha and WL opportunities with some big upcoming projects.

Web3 is the future, pay close attention to the space 👀🚀"
