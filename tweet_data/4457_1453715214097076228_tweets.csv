0,"@0xDeveloperEth @InvsbleFriends I imagine it is similar thinking here. when something like @InvsbleFriends could potentially draw eyes and funds away from the collections they are heavily invested in, they may Spread FUD to try and prevent people from selling other blue chips to buy into new potential blue chip"
1,@0xDeveloperEth @InvsbleFriends If they are prominent people/ collectors it’s similar to a common practice in art. Collectors that are heavily invested in specific artists will always try to bid up the prices of the artists other pieces when they go to auction.

3,"@DanNFT1892 There is certain things you can try to do, like limiting mints per wallet, but there seems to always be around it, once you set up a bot it’s easy enough to open a bunch of wallets to mint with"
4,@DanNFT1892 Until there’s a good way to prevent bots from taking over a public mint there will be a need for WL

17,@crypto7rex @InvsbleFriends 2 things I hate about @InvsbleFriends. 1. I don’t have one. 2. All the derivatives I’m going to have to see shilled in the next few weeks
18,@_JaredEstes @ThetaMars @psychedelic_nft Go to https://t.co/g4s2z0paiY to see if there are any allowances on any tokens in the wallet first. Shoot me a DM with your brothers wallet address and which transaction is sending the ETH elsewhere

27,@darkp0rt @NFTethics Not sure why people want @NFTethics to be wrong about the scams. If you want you can always send your ETH to the burn address
28,@Beno1t_eth Nice haha
29,@ethvltkongo The hard part is finding top tier projects early on. There’s a lot of fakes and everyone says they’re going to be blue chip. How do you get into top tier projects early when there’s very little track record?
30,"@Beno1t_eth @its_dartt step 1. Right click save pfp

44,@thenftherapist @TheWearyLuddite @NFTswithNate It also creates a perfect space for scammers. The space has fostered a culture of FOMO and seemingly encourages split second decisions. All the scammers are preying on it
45,"@NFTswithNate @thenftherapist I think the 500% flips are going away because projects are minting and doing DA at much higher prices. To me that's not sustainable either, gotta get back to the 0.0X price days"
