14,"@WonderPals is a great example of how to launch an NFT project. Mint was .08... Not .5 eth, not 1 eth, not 3 eth.

With a very large community they could have tried to do a .5 or even 1 ETH mint, but they didn't. Other projects need to learn from them."

95,@PunkieEth Part of the reason I wanted to hold was because I saw your tweets and saw you had so many bears delisted. Once bears pumped I realized that the real money is in investing in good projects and not just quick flipping projects post mint
96,@PunkieEth Punkie you’re the 🐐 and the reason I’m still in this game. Back when bears came out I was just getting into NFTs and had lost a decent amount of ETH trying to quick flip. When I saw bears something stuck out and I wanted to hold post mint.
