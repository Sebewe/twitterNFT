37,"dAMM enables:

* ZK-based L2s (e.g., DeversiFi, Loopring …) to asynchronously share liquidity — exposing LPs to more trades
* LPs to serve L1 AMM while partaking in L2 trading =&gt; scaling without compromise
* dAMM harnesses the permissionless nature of L1"
38,"What is a dAMM?
(distributed Automated Market Maker)
A dAMM is a cross-L2 AMM design developed jointly by Loopring and Starkware. https://t.co/eLoM0EixEW"
39,"27/ they can sign a valid state transition but withhold the data. In this case, the state is “frozen” and users will not be able to withdraw, but the attacker’s stake is frozen as well. Thus, there is no direct way for an attacker with a large stake to financially benefit"
40,"26/ as a result, ultra-low transaction fees comparable with sidechains (in the range of a few cents).""

The security of zkPorter is better than any other L1 or sidechain. In the worst case, where a malicious actor controls both the sequencer and over ⅔ of the total stake,"
41,"25/ zkPorter is zkSync's validium implementation
zkPorter puts data availability-essential tx data needed to reconstruct state offchain rather than on Ethereum. DA is secured using PoS by zkSync token stakers. This enables much higher scalability (tens of thousands TPS), and"
42,"24/ Immutable X-NFT layer-2 that utilizes StarkEx volition to provide massive scalability to NFTs by offering open NFT marketplace, access for partnered projects to run NFT games and apps on their network &amp; cheap, fast, secure, and scalable user experience to NFT enthusiasts."
43,23/ Volition is an architecture (pioneered by Starkware) that an L2 can adopt where the user can choose whether to use a validium or a zk-rollup on the L2 on a per transaction basis. Allows user to specify whether he wants to maximize decentralization and security or scalability
44,"22/ A validium is a type of scaling solution that utilizes validity proofs but has off-chain data availability. It compromises Ethereum security, however is still much more secure than a sidechain since the state transitions have verified validity through the use of STARKs/SNARKs"
45,"21/ Validium/Volition (offchain calldata)
a hybrid approach to scaling, one that doesn't put calldata on-chain and instead takes some compromises in security in order to increase scalability."
46,"20/ Aztec Network
a privacy-focused ZK-rollup L2 on Ethereum. The Aztec Network L2 allows for fast, cheap, DeFi compatible transactions in a completely private fashion without compromising Ethereum security and decentralization."
47,"19/ StarkEx generates validity proofs which ensure that all the off-chain computations were performed with integrity, the STARK proof generated then gets verified on-chain before getting committed to Ethereum mainnet."
48,18/ STARKs (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge) - form of validity proof with completely trustless setup that enables offloading all on-chain computation off-chain to a single off-chain STARK prover.
49,17/ Zero-knowledge rollups are called zero-knowledge is because they are able to give mathematical proofs to statements &amp; conditions without revealing any if the information that required to do so. These proofs are called ZK-(SNARK/STARK)
50,"16/ Optimism
utilizes fraud proofs but different mechanism from Arb1.
It is EVM equivalent. Whereas Arbitrum is EVM Compatible."
51,"15/ Once the DTD passes, the state changes on the network can be considered valid and users can withdraw their available balances through the native bridge."
52,"14/ Arbitrum
Arbitrum One utilizes fraud proofs and has on-chain call data availability, meaning that all of the data of each transaction is fully sequenced, bundled, and submitted to mainnet. Since it utilizes fraud proofs, there is a dispute time delay (DTD) of about 7 days."
53,"13/ The 4 main L2s are:

Optimistic Rollups
1. Arbitrum
2. Optimistic

ZK Rollups
1. Starkware
2. zkSynce"
54,"12/ Economic sustainability

1/ The L1 ideally generates more revenue than the cost of operating the network (centralized L1s do not).As blockchains sell blocks

2/ Throughput can't be artificially increased because eventually, all centralized L1s will have to increase their fees"
55,"11/ Technical sustainability

1. Nodes need to be in sync
2. Sync from the genesis of the blockchain in a reasonable amount of time
3. Avoid state bloat getting out of hand"
56,10/ All blockchains needs to achieve technical and economic sustainability.
57,9/ https://t.co/16mLCfA84C
58,"8/ off-chain: the execution calldata and the state is handled and held off-chain by the L2. This makes it a less secure and decentralized option. However, it is much easier to bundle more transactions into the rollup, thus scaling much faster than on-chain calldata proofs."
59,7/ on-chain: the state data - along with all of the execution calldata of all txs are put together into the cryptographic proof of a bundle/roll-up of transactions which makes all of the data accessible &amp; verifiable on-chain.
60,"6/ There are 2 types of Cryptographic Proofs:

1. Validity proofs - mathematical proofs utilising ZK cryptography to ensure validity of tx

2. Fraud proofs - Validator has time to mark the proof as invalid; an invalid proof could have incorrect state transitions"
61,"5/ There are 2 main parameters used to categorize L2's:

1. Cryptographic proof used 
2. Whether data availability is on-chain or off-chain"
62,4/ The bridge of a true L2 is fully permissionless and decentralized so there's always a guarantee the funds are accessible once deposited by users
63,"3/ If an L2 were to go dark due to a bug, infrastructure exploits, or outage, the funds are safely secured by the L1 within a smart contract bridge. The funds can be retrieved according to the latest state snapshot submitted onto the mainnet."
64,"2/ An L2 (layer-two) is a type of scaling solution that has a separate execution layer (where code runs, i.e. EVM) that inherits the security guarantees &amp; decentralization of the network it’s running on top of L1

The data availability and consensus would still take place on L1"
65,"1/ L1 has three functions. 

1. Execution
2. Consensus 
3. Data Availability

This makes it slow and expensive as the network grows and gets congested as all 3 components have to take place on the Layer 1 network"
