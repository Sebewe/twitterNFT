I think it will be a good one! There will be a POAP to claim as well🔑"
27,"So as we know, “keys” will get you access to the collection…

Key holders will determine mint price/value of the actual collection…

If they decide free mint for key holders I’m down…if it’s .05, I support it…remember there is no value w/out community…

More info later…"
28,"I also did a scavenger hunt via the  @Ness_Graphics discord…@DarfV8DR found “Community Key 6/9”

The scavenger hunt consisted of finding Easter eggs in NG’s artwork including keys, Polaroids, &amp; pizza…

I even included a “Ness Key” in my key artwork🔑 https://t.co/R1n9RVjUNj"
29,"I did a giveaway via the gm show… “Community Key 2/9” won by @WolfAdvenPhoto 

I used a random picker but i love the question he asked in the form:

“How do you get ppl to actually look at your stuff &amp; see it for what it’s meant to be?” https://t.co/rO5eoix1W3"

57,"This banner popped up yesterday…probably nothing…

You are not necessarily losing your memory…

”you’ve been losing your keys all your life” https://t.co/A8c6vqNAxt"
58,"Can’t wait to see who finds keys this week!🔑🔑🔑 

end 🧵 https://t.co/BDdPSVOhpJ"
59,"Because they are a growing community + talking about being a great community…

Building organic community takes time…it’s easy for ppl to just move on to the next project that pumps…

So let’s see if it’s just more than “WAGMI” “LFG” &amp; “delist”🛸 /11 https://t.co/AgLOxY2Zrm"
60,"I also picked up a @quirkiesnft b/c I loved the art…I think they were beautifully influenced by @alienfrens @doodles &amp; more…which were two projects I missed out on but have really come to love their art + communities.

Why am I including this in the recap?👇🏼 /10 https://t.co/O73uHPIc0x"
61,"Key giveaways are being dropped in different communities

1 being @Ness_Graphics but you got to hold one of his pieces to access the collectors discord channel…

I also dropped some alpha w/ @goku_nft &amp; @IAMAIMOS on the gm show…might want to check their discord for more info👀 https://t.co/VX2XUTSIMG"

63,"First off I want to thank @aaronrferguson for co-hosting the first official “I Lost My Keys” space.

And thank you for those who came! And collected the first “I Lost My Keys” POAP…

This will play into “finding” the next key…but don’t worry…there will be more chances.  /7"
64,"So here is the weekly recap from February 6th-13th &amp; maybe what to look forward to this week…

More than just the super bowl happened… /6 https://t.co/fwHXSjHoLE"
65,"I have been in the NFT space for a year…I could have dropped my “Follow Your Daydreams” collection w/in the 1st month…

Instead I collected, learned, to know I was committed to this space…

I think that collection reflects my knowledge + commitment…/5

https://t.co/GKztQoRf6b"
66,"So far I have found collectors who trust in the process of what I am creating…it means everything to me🙏🏼

I already place enough pressure on myself.

I try to be thoughtful in how I navigate this space…

Social media doesn’t necessarily value that…ppl often see # of followers"
67,"The NFT space moves fast but I think there is an unreasonable of pressure placed on individual artists to constantly tweet &amp; share about what’s going on…

This can be counterproductive for creativity…social media takes a lot of energy &amp; time to create thoughtful threads…

/4 https://t.co/8uvWpHSouW"
68,"This is a long term project…there are already so many things planned but community driven projects take time…

Staying healthy also takes time…

So I want to find a balance.

/3 https://t.co/FMDpLAbulI"
69,"I try to give 5-7 days to complete a scavenger hunt/turn in a form/etc 

I am looking for 50 ppl looking to participate in this project but they don’t need to center their lives around it…

I also don’t want you to feel like your grinding to find the “key”
/2"
70,"gm. I’ve been thinking…

I want an engaged community but I don’t want a community that thinks they need to be glued to their phones w/ fomo if they don’t see a certain announcement…

So, I am going to post weekly recaps for “I Lost My Keys” Sun/Mon each week…To the 1st recap"
