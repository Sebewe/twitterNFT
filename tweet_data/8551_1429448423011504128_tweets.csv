„The network effect of Treasure is not determined by the number of projects that carry the Treasure brand name but rather the number of projects integrated into the base-layer infrastructure.“

78,@cryptopl33b Yeah they will have value. Hard to say how much now. I personally think there needs to be some kind of deflationary mechanism in place apart from summoning. But I always trust the team to monitor and adapt in those cases.
79,@mrcll_glys That ratio depends on the share of people crafting/questing. We will see how this enfolds.
80,"@mrcll_glys @Boirray You need 4 T5s for an easy craft. Their breaking prob is 18%. That means in 72% of all quests 1 T5 Treasure is burned. Less supply, higher demand for crafting, higher prices.

85,"3rd prediction 💡: People won’t sell their aux legions as we imagined, even after the next summoning. Having an aux legion army is really powerful, because they generate you treasures through quests and consumables through crafts. Right now only 52 are listed which means &lt;1%! https://t.co/el1i9DjEP0"
86,2nd prediction 💡: Medium and large prisms will have real value. Prisms increase the chance of getting rarer legions during summoning. Having rarer legions means that you can sell them for a higher price on the marketplace. You get the point right? 💰 https://t.co/W4utfm4Jeg
87,"1st prediction 💡 We will see a big run on treasures. For every easy craft you need 1 T3, 2 T4 and 4 T5 treasure. People will need them and those treasures break, meaning that we now have deflationary mechanisms with a direct affect on the market economics. https://t.co/f9joqJgr65"
