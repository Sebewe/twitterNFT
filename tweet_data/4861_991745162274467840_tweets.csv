12,@iLiquidatebots Please crypto gods.
13,"@vibevibevibe__ @MakerDAO @CurveFinance @ConvexFinance @LiquityProtocol @AaveAave @compoundfinance @iearnfinance @Instadapp @SushiSwap You are correct. It’s been a confusing time for DeFi tokens, especially the tokens with clear fee accrual. Been surprised how much they’ve bled out last 12 months vs L1 tokens."

But now we expect to see huge growth in DeFi for Ethereum zkRollup-based L2s like StarkNet and zkEVM in 2022 within new money markets like @zkLend and AMMs. And continued growth in ORUs like Optimism + Arbitrum. https://t.co/uYFhYurAqd"
21,"If you need to communicate protocol updates to wallets in your community, get @epnsproject implemented asap.

50,@jerisbrisk @ParallelNFT Right? Omg so happy to get the PS15 choke cards.
51,@floodedark @ParallelNFT Agreed. Little worried how these fare near term with all the other macro risks to crypto but I like the Gambler cards as a collector.
52,"@evan_van_ness I wish man. Never got past “I work in crypto” but seriously not the convos from 2017.

😲 And I mostly listened, jaw open."
57,"While in Miami for a vacay, so many nice strangers unexpectedly talking crypto.

58,"@BCD_Guru @ParallelNFT Those PL cards drive me crazy.

They're the coolest looking.

The animations stand out.

They have smaller supplies.

Yet the prices sold off.

Have you noticed this?"
59,@Dyslexic_Cyborg @NexusMutual @AaveAave @maplefinance I'm guessing someone out there who's using Nansen and other tools to figure it out on-chain. And appreciate any further insights you have to offer!
60,"@BCD_Guru @ParallelNFT I somewhat agree. But same time, these cards were absurdly priced due to less than 1% of the supply circulating.

I think part of the reason I'm so happy to get them is i waited forever expecting these few PS15 cards to drop like a rock."
61,"@Dyslexic_Cyborg @NexusMutual @AaveAave @maplefinance Not much of a data-driven discussion, it's been a talking point since 2020 among bigger funds I've spoken with.

I could be wrong.

One interesting on-chain story I follow is active cover per project in Nexus: Anchor, Aave, Convex, Curve, Abra. https://t.co/Y2qL9HKwoL"

67,@whipper156 @NotionalFinance Is notional less popular though with retail? You’re prob right.
68,@FlendersNeth @ribbonfinance I think @ribbonfinance has been popular among retail but I’m just judging based off their following in the markets the last year. Unsure who make up the bulk of their LPs now.
69,@brendan_opensea Great point. I think maybe cuz Maker is popular among retail but guessing OG retail users on Maker are much wealthier now.
70,@araphel_eth @CurveFinance @ConvexFinance I think both these are killing it with retail and big money. Wondering what’s doing less well with retail but growing with larger capital managers.
71,@Duffaluffaguss @maplefinance @CelsiusNetwork Woah that’s interesting.
72,"@SHIBAATTACKNOW That’s interesting. I reviewed Geist early on but it looks like its TVL has shrunk a lot since Nov.

Not that TVL is a perfect metric to measure comparable growth.

I haven’t heard any big money looking at Geist like Compound or Aave."
73,@Duffaluffaguss @maplefinance Yes! I agree. I didn’t see Maple get popular among retail degens but yet it’s had continued growth.
74,"A few big names with more traction:

Derivatives DEXs like dYdX

Insurance like @NexusMutual 

My understanding is big money makes up more of the pie at Compound and @AaveAave 

Also, undercollateralized lending to bigger borrowers via @maplefinance?"
75,@Crypto_Texan @indexcoop But do you see increasing interest among bigger money investors?
76,"What are DeFi protocols still growing protocol revenue / TVL that may appeal less to retail while they’re increasingly popular among funds, whales, and early TradFi-like investors?"
77,"@0xtuba I’m bearish on what’s complex.

I still have hope for fixed rate lending (ie 88mph, APWine).

These are easy to use and I say that with no bags in these projects, just enjoy as a user.

DeFi options (while easier than TradFi options), still feel relatively complex vs other DeFi."
78,"@santiagoroel Is this evidence more Bitcoiners don’t know how to use self-custody wallets or send BTC or they’re unwilling to help as much?

I’m guessing the former.

So many more wallets participating on Ethereum."
