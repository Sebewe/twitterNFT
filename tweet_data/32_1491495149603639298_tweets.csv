@Twitter &amp; @TwitterSupport - how can you justify this ? And when do you start to provide the transparency that Web3 expects?

1,"@aboud_fn Of course HypeBears is a rug. You really think that the ""founder"" is Ernest Siow? He is a model (look him up) and a puppet that they paid to keep the real founders anonymous. Don't be naive."
2,"3/ For those who want another glimpse into the life of certain NFT founders, we welcome you to look at this TikTok profile: https://t.co/6LUh2lLtEB

You will see caviar, Lamborghinis, luxury watches, hotels, clubs, etc. And it's all with your money. And they all know about it!"
3,2/ The attached PDF shows a lot of evidence of this scam ring responsible for many rugs and hopefully opens the eyes of many NFT holders who think that founders have their best interest at heart. It shows what they are doing with you money. https://t.co/ePz9JVwPhg
4,"1/ Three days ago we mentioned we would reveal a scam ring. Unfortunately our Twitter account then got suspended for violating the rules of ""impersonation"". We don't know why as we have never impersonated anyone, but we still wanted to warn people not to mint Squiggles today. https://t.co/BO1qATOIzL"
5,"@Adambak22324050 @NFTethics You are aware that Squiggles is a rug, are you?"
6,@Glooopglooop @NFTethics Thanks for the suggestion but the problem is that we often want to alert people for a specific project or person. Social media is very suitable for warnings like this as news will quickly spread around. There is an upcoming project with over 230k followers which will be a rug.
7,"@Loopifyyy GM, both from our old account @NFTethics (that was suspended), as well as from our new account. https://t.co/QBLqpa8cjU"
8,"Dear @Twitter &amp; @TwitterSupport, can you please explain why our previous account @NFTethics was and remains suspended? Why do you think we impersonated someone else? 

Were we a potential danger to your (unethical) business model or was it something else?

9,"@the_freightrain @NFTethics In this tweet you will find the explanation, or at least the explanation that Twitter gave. https://t.co/QBLqpa8cjU"
10,Twitter suspended our previous account for violating their rules regarding “impersonation”. We don’t know what they meant by that and have appealed the decision also asking for clarification. Today we heard that back that our account @NFTethics will remain suspended. No idea why. https://t.co/kBl2GZYJny
