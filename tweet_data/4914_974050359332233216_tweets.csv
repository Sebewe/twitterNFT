85,@polymathsguild @LadyofCrypto1 @zachxbt Sir you forgot the buzz word “meta verse”
86,@buzzzedcrypto @LadyofCrypto1 @zachxbt LMAO man I wish… most real game studios struggle to raise even 1 million. Like most startup game companies (not crypto related) are lucky to get 100k+ raised
87,@LadyofCrypto1 @zachxbt Which we all happily funded blindly 😅
88,@ShukanOk @zachxbt Sir I pray for him fr tho. Feel like he was a investor really building trust into a team and seeing they had tons of money to produce a game ect. He also tried to be positive about floor being half mint. Feel bad bruh.
89,@AliMarwani10 @zachxbt @polychainmon @tubbycatsnft Thanks friend. 😂🙏🏻 I also learned lessons from that… mainly bought cuz of some influencers I really trusted at the time lol. I take full responsibility tho. I bought cuz of the hype and got wrecked and from then on stopped blindly following influencer calls lol
90,@InvestedBee @zachxbt ☠️
91,@AliMarwani10 @zachxbt @polychainmon Lmao omg… Yea I lost 6k buying those and trying to buy the token. I remember it going to like $50-80 and people getting wrecked by bots after. Whole thing was fucking baddd 😂
