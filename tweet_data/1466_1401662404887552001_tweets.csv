0,"@G00NR They announced it a couple of months ago. They don't really have an announced roadmap, but have dropped hints of future utility for Space Doodles, etc."
1,"Not many NFTs make both kids and grown ups smile as much as Space Doodles. Pretty freakin great utility, IMHO."
2,Another punk sweep... 🧹 Wen unflippening?
3,"@punk9511 True dat, my long lost brother punk!"
4,"Granted this stuff is highly speculative and could all go down much further but, if you believe in a project, probably good to have a longer time horizon than 12 hours or so. 🤷‍♂️"
5,@ryancarson Congrats. That was quick - you weren't punkless for long. Welcome back to the fam!
6,@sfirr0 Good point. The joy is priceless.
7,"To keep my remaining Doodles unrolled or roll them, that is the question. From a purely value perspective, might be better to leave unrolled...who am I kidding though. I'm just a big kid and the joy of seeing my Space Doodles is no doubt going to win out."
8,"@G00NR I would, yes. I would actually try to track them down before it sold to ask them if they knew what they were doing. That's just me though. I wouldn't want to take advantage of someone who doesn't understand what they are selling."
9,@G00NR Yep. 😭
10,"PSA: When you sell your Space Doodle, you are also selling your regular Doodle with it. A couple of Space Doodles have sold for way under Doodles prices."
11,"RT @doodles: We've made contact. Introducing Space Doodles 🚀💫

ONLY Launch your Doodle into Space at: https://t.co/ildvabA6Az

12,@hypemansionclub Nice. I took a couple classes with Elzinga as well. Graduated a bit before you though.
13,RT @notwarrenETH: Going to space with the @doodles squad like: https://t.co/NgYpbcnRNl
14,RT @alfiemotion: A reminder for today. We are NOT minting. There are no purchasable NFTs from us. Space Doodles is free for holders only! O…
15,"@JustinMezzell @proof_xyz 👀 LFG, proof fam!"
16,GM. Had to change my pfp to one of my Doodles as my fellow @doodles and I begin final launch prep for our mission to space later today. LFG! 🚀🌈🌕
17,"RT @richerd: I've seen what is coming for @doodles, its gonna blow all your minds.

LFG 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕"
18,"The fact that some of the best artists and web3 devs are excited about Space Doodles is telling. Gn fellow Doodles. Get some rest, we have a big day ahead. 🌈🚀"
19,@doodles Holy crap. Let's go.
20,@cozywyatt @doodles Literally not going to be able to sleep tonight.
21,@HelsinkiMystic Not that I know of
22,Punks getting swept 🧹👀
23,@Lazy_mfers @sartoshi_nft #1538 https://t.co/Mpy0XeMGbK
24,"Just hoping I get Space Doodles with good bladders and good vibe scores, and I probably won't come back to Earth."
25,@Rugglebuggles @doodles That is a nice puker. Looks like we have a new member of the RBP fam.
26,"I would be mildly surprised if Elon got an ape. TBH, If he ever got an NFT, seems like he would go for an mfer. https://t.co/bJOWn9uCJp"
27,@0x_fxnction @yugalabs True dat. It amazes me how many people don’t understand U.S. securities laws and actually believe any BAYC token drop will amount to equity.
28,"RT @sartoshi_nft: omg the art is amazing 

ser thats a photo your dad took with a kodak disc while playing duck hunt in 1985"
29,"Do you ever think to yourself this has got to be some crazy fcking simulation we are in right now? (I do a lot, but then snap out of it and then merrily buy more jpegs)."
30,"@strangersolemn Thanks again, mfer. These mfers all look like they are having a blast. https://t.co/GxUrQ1xtxb"
31,"@TheCryptoLark TBH, I would have thought if Elon got any pfp it would be a mfer. https://t.co/hCaBCUTbx6"
32,"@mooncat2878 Well put, mfer"
33,"@sweettoothnft @RTFKTstudios @Nike @punk6333 @Nate_Rivers @RBsNFTs @clerkclirk Congrats, enjoy! I have a feeling I’m going to regret letting him go, but looks like he’s in good hands."
34,"@Mnewbis @HunkinsNFT @kaitlin_easton Yeah. Me too. I was flattered at first, like I must have really be writing some good shit."
35,"@MetaBananas Congrats, mfer"
36,"@palmtreeshinobi @JfellzZ seriously, I'm watching just so I don't miss the comedy coming from @JfellzZ comments"

40,"@NiftyReport Just read this. This is great, and relatable. You should write more often."
41,@alexarnault @doodles Nice dood. Welcome to the fam.
42,"Picked up my 3rd ape mpher of the day. This may not age well for me, but have been in a range to just take a chance on these cute lil mphers."
43,"RT @MfersStudios: News Flash! 
@MfersStudios is in development for the first ever #mfersmovie. 
Are #mfers even interested in one? 
Let us…"
44,@deekaymotion @CozomoMedici @XCOPYART @doodles Dood looks like he's got a lot on his mind
45,@GratefulPillar Thanks mpher
46,@marv_sun Few. Now I can sleep at night!
47,@7012io Yep. Some people seem to think they go off to one side. I've always viewed them as just popping out from their heads.
48,It's 2 perfectly symmetrical floating eyes that pop out from their heads!!!
49,"@KalebsCode That’s because you’re a real mfer, fam"
50,"@maur_er @sartocheap_nft Thanks. I snagged another ape at .999 a few minutes later. Still think almost all the value is in the OG mfer token, but since this is CC0 there isn't a problem with these guys and they may track mfers somewhat."
51,Picked up an ape mpher for .99 ETH. Am I crazy? Yep. https://t.co/smZpCCDy1Y
52,@cryptokid_btc @doodles That is a flawless dood. Welcome to the RBP fam! https://t.co/hm37Edf1zi
53,"@itsdanataylor Nice to have you in the fam, mfer"
54,"@marv_sun @doodles I dunno. To me, it looks right as is and would look odd to have it facing forward with an eye off-centered. Almost like a drunk Dood. But that is just my opinion, and given how slow things are right now, this is the most interesting discussion I've had in a while. 😂"
55,"@PabloPunkasso Your mfers are getting sniped, mfers"
56,"@marv_sun @doodles It's a floating eye, not an off-centered eye (at least that is how I've always viewed it). If the Dood turned facing you, the eyes would be centered horizontally but they do pop out from the face. I think 🤔"
57,"RT @strangersolemn: Meanwhile down on lo fi beach...
#mfers https://t.co/VOFBpGaXO7"
58,@SteveG60117 Nope. You are not the only one.
59,"@DiscoverXnft Yep, and the community will lap it up once again. 🥴"
60,"Or else they are going to zero, in which case we'll always have the memories"
61,@realbrotoshi Yep. Thanks mfer.
62,"@G00NR Yep, we ask a lot of our mfers and they don't demand much in return. It's the least we could do. I've given my mfers the day off."
63,Poor lil Mfers are tired and taking a well-deserved rest
64,@private_dood 7 days 🌈🚀
65,"I joke a lot about mfers, mainly because the memes are endless, but about the only thing increasing at a faster rate than the price of mfers is the unofficial mfers treasury. Mfers is much more than a meme, mfers."
66,"@JohnKnopfPhotos Gm, mfer"
67,"@KalebsCode gm, mfer"
68,@white_tiger416 @sartoshi_nft Thanks mfer. But all mfers are equal. Your red hoodie is a clean mfer.
69,"@white_tiger416 @sartoshi_nft Right here, mfer https://t.co/24iWk30Jo6"
70,@strangersolemn Looks like those mfers are having a fvcking blast.
71,"@hackerdreamer Nice. That's a nice zombie mfer, mfer."
72,"Gm. I really liked the Doodles minimalist merch. That is stuff I'll wear every day, but fashion tastes differ. However, let's not lose sight of the bigger event one week away. 🚀🌈"
73,"@L3xcNFT Nothing would surprise me, degen art mfer"
74,Holy crap mfers. You lil fvckers are relentless. Keep up the good work.
75,"@Newenglandpiece I don't want to imagine a world without mfers, mfer"
76,@burnttoast ._.
77,@EB7 @doodles 💯
78,"@Andras5k True dat. We're all mfer, in fact."
79,"@wheredidmyethgo Thanks, mfer"
80,"@Degentraland @doodles I dunno. Seems like I'm in the minority, but I like starting off understated to begin with and then getting flashier in subsequent drops."
81,"@DrJayPeggs I mean, literally the best hedge I have against everything else nuking recently https://t.co/Imbj0ab8x1"
82,"@L3xcNFT @geniexyz LFG, mfer"
83,The only responsible way to hedge against the possibility of all other assets going to zero is to buy mfers
84,RT @marto_gm: https://t.co/iNwCExCvbd
85,@TrustlessState gm mfer
86,@JamesEdenpw @markdono 😂😂😭😭
87,@JamesEdenpw @markdono True dat. Literally every of the billions of mfers on the planet could have bought more mfers at lower prices.
88,"@NFTethics WTF was the skeleton though? The fact that he is partners with the owner of the NY Mets or that his friend told him to buy cannabis stocks a couple weeks before the legislature legalized cannabis through a vote, which presumably wasn't a secret."
89,"@strangersolemn @sartoshi_nft Thanks for the invite, mfer. https://t.co/XThkTHMAXb"
90,"@markdono Thanks, mfer. Don't ask me about the top hat zombie I sold for 15 ETH a couple weeks ago though, mfer 😭"
91,"@markdono Beanie floor is 44.5 ETH, mfer"
92,RT @MattLeinartQB: LFG baby!!!!
93,"RT @danielgothits: normal ppl during OS exploit:

94,"@StevenIzen Thanks. You too, mfer."
95,"We having fun yet, mfers?"
96,"@danielgothits Good move, mfer"
97,"@rpholmie True dat, mfer. I want to hug each one of my mfers in my wallet and thank them for rescuing me from all the mistakes I've made."
98,@mferpapi I should have pulled the trigger on another mfer earlier today. Floor seems to running again.
99,Mfer token is not priced in
