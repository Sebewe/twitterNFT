52,"@DrMichaelLBrown I do differ only in that I think your statement was an over generalization &amp; it makes me wonder how many clips you saw. 

That said, you know I highly respect your prophetic voice thy transcends parties. 

My goal at the event was to carry the Presence of Christ &amp; encourage."
53,"@DrMichaelLBrown 5 days worth of speakers. Breakouts, etc. Clips in the greater context of the overall conversation always better. 

I had my issues. 

The MC for the Reagan dinner being one, people fawning to get selfies, etc. 

This was not a Christian event. 

Christians are there for sure."
54,"@DrMichaelLBrown I have other issues for sure. 

A Christ-less conservatism is deadly. 

I had so many great interactions with speakers, people running for office, students, &amp; others to say in love that your assessment simply is to broad of a brush painting the event. 

Just my opinion"
55,"@DrMichaelLBrown Dr. Brown, I was at CPAC &amp; your assessment does not match the overall tone of the 5 days of meetings. 

While I did not hear every session, the conversations in the hall were uplifting and I was personable able to pray with many people. 

Was it a perfect event, by no means."
