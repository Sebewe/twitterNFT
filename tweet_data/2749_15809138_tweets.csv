And the community seems to be learning it the hard way: one hack at a time.""

Amen.

Building is hard. These learnings will make cross-chain bridges like Wormhole better with time.

✌️"
51,"And it's not unsolvable per se, just a newer problem!

Here's gigabrain @zac_aztec:

""The attack surface for cross-chain bridges is different and novel.

e.g. the poly network hack exploited cross-chain messaging code that enabled a re-entrancy attack."""
52,"If state gets rolled back on one chain, that ripples across the bridge to another chain.

The more successful the bridge (and its canonical assets):

a) the bigger the target for an attack
b) the more assets at risk"
53,"But that's still one of two big weaknesses:

1) You have to trust a smaller set of validators to faithfully communicate blockchain state

2) Bridges mix the security of multiple chains and by definition compound risk"
54,"Vitalik was saying ""it's a lot easier to 51% attack a bridging protocol's 19-node validator set than an L1's 30,000 nodes, and if the prize is big enough, it could happen.""

He didn't say that multi-chain bridges are at a greater risk of smart contract bugs than anything else."
55,"At the end of the day, despite the size of the hack--

(and the inconvenient fact that the two largest hacks of all time on the @RektHQ leaderboard are cross-chain bridges)

--this was a smart contract bug.

https://t.co/huMg4xKGGq"
56,"So like, what next?

Is the cross-chain thesis totally fucked?

Is Solana a 3rd-rate blockchain?

Did Vitamin's cross-chain prophecy become true?

- Let Wormhole $weETH collapse and tear through Solana, destroying some protocols, hurting others badly, weeks of FUD and terrible $SOL publicity

- Write the check and it blows over by tomorrow"
58,"It wasn't even all the $ETH on Solana:

Most of it is bridged and secured by @FTX_Official.

Speaking of which, who covered the shortfall?

Likely the market makers and exchanges who provide $weETH exit liquidity during the hack.

Or:

https://t.co/ZSC3S01FpD"
59,"But it never happened.

Wormhole for its part is making good on its $WETH backing, pledging to fill the $325 million shortfall in a matter of *hours*.

$weETH is back to parity with other forms of $ETH on Solana.

https://t.co/SlbWkhJ9XC"
60,"There could have been extreme knock-on effects of assets going to 0:

1) Liquidity pools with $weETH

2) Lending protocols with $weETH collateral backing becoming undercollateralized

3) Borrowers with $weETH collateral getting liquidated

https://t.co/5j8GZFoOsp"
61,"So where's the systemic risk?

In the hour after the hack, all the paper claims on $ETH became paper claims on...nothing.

Wormhole $ETH price expectedly diverged from other, more secure forms of $ETH (secured by bridges from e.g. @FTX_Official):

https://t.co/S35sCaGQAi"
62,"The rest of the haul was swapped on Serum for $SOL and $USDC:

https://t.co/RhJ56ZEpqn"
63,"They bridged 2/3 of it back to Ethereum, redeeming it for $ETH from the Wormhole contract.

After all, $weETH is just a paper claim on Solana.

It's redeemable for $WETH locked on Ethereum, but it's ultimately secured by Wormhole.

https://t.co/1863ApQFvx"
64,"So what the hacker did is exploit a bug to trick Wormhole into minting them a bunch of $weETH on Solana.

Like, $325 million worth."
65,"Bridging funds is one feature of cross-chain bridges, done via a mint-and-lock mechanism:

1) A user puts $WETH into Wormhole's Ethereum smart contract

2) Validators observe and agree that the user did so

3) Wormhole $ETH ($weETH) is minted from Wormhole's Solana smart contract"
66,"But something something centralization, something something censorship resistance!

So instead there is a *set* of trusted observers who watch smart contract activity.

Each says ""I saw something happen on Ethereum.""

Then, if they all agree, then the message is passed."
67,"Say I was trying to pass a message from Ethereum to Solana.

How would I do so, given they don't talk to one another?

The first way would be for me to simply say to someone on Solana:

""I saw something happen on Ethereum. Trust me."""
68,"First, how cross-chain bridges like Wormhole work:

A bridge is essentially a way to agree on the current state of two different networks.

You can think of it as a cross-chain communications protocol.

A blockchain-to-blockchain messaging app."
69,"Whew. Hell of a week for systemic risk.

Wormhole, a Solana cross-chain bridge, was exploited today for $325 million (120,000 $ETH).
