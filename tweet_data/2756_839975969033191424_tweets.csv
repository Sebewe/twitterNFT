4,lol wth is going on https://t.co/yfINDqQOgd
5,@alexarnault @doodles Oh damn nice pickup sir.
6,@MikeMcDonald89 Haha holy shit I was literally just thinking about this as a viable strategy for stables holders after the merge goes live and eth yields explode.
7,"Time for disclaimers: I advise extremely few projects, and usually only ones where I know the founders well, but I was happy to sign on here due to their ETH alignment and long-term focus. The team offered me some tokens and a couple Idol NFTs as well in return :)."
8,"I haven't gotten to a lot of the community and metaverse aspects yet, but will probably do another thread later. Join the discord for now if you're interested. https://t.co/0jGvJq0otF"
9,"Essentially, founder tokens only vest if the bonding price hits certain points. If the $VIRTUE token isn't successful, team doesn't get paid 🤷‍♂️. If the NFT isn't desirable in 12 months, team doesn't get paid 🤷‍♂️. I dunno, but this sort of looks like long-term conviction to me."
10,"Scam pfps don't last a year, in case you haven't noticed. I like the team's long-term conviction here. They also get a 15% allocation of $VIRTUE, but this is also done extremely tastefully. Instead of a time-based vesting with cliffs or whatnot, it's a ""success""-based vest."
11,"Every decision has been made with community ownership in mind. So how does the team actually get paid, and what are the mechanics? The team keeps a 10% Idol NFT allocation for themselves (similar to @nounsdao), but this comes with a 1yr lock."
12,"The team could have chosen to take a portion of the ETH from the mint for themselves, but they didn't. They could have taken the ETH collected from the bonding curve, but they didn't. They could have taken the royalties for themselves, but also no."
13,"3. Vesting, conviction, alignment, and team allocation. 

Ok, so cool art and a token doesn't really get me out of bed, and certainly doesn't get me to sign on as an advisor. The team here has done something that (I think) has never been done before and is novel."
14,"There's like this sort of cool flywheel effect here. NFT holders earn stETH rewards. If desirable, will lead to more trading volume, which leads to more royalties for token holders, which (if more people want to buy the token as a result) leads to more stETH for NFT holders..."
15,"token, you should DYOR. You can read more about it here. https://t.co/3y0tSEPRJA

But what's cool here is that the ETH collected by the bonding curve doesn't go to the team either! Instead it goes into the stETH treasury, which means more staking rewards for Idol NFT holders!"
16,"2. Royalty mechanism. So there exist royalties for Idol NFT trades. But instead of going to the team they go to ""token holders."" $VIRTUE tokens are created through a bonding curve (sort of like an ICO) that you can buy into, etc etc. Pretty standard stuff, and ofc as with any"
17,"No multisig, no governance, no admin powers, nothing. Remember the ETH maxi spin I was talking about? The ETH will literally validate the Ethereum network forever! They amusingly consider themselves “guardians” of the Ethereum network. True $ETH alignment!"
18,"Alright, so 3 main reasons why this is actually different. 

1. 100% of the ETH raised in the mint gets staked and turned into stETH. The staking rewards go directly back to Idol NFT holders. The crazy part is that this ETH is locked away *forever* in a 100% immutable contract."
19,"First, the Greek mythology vibes are super dope. I’m not the greatest art critic but I think these things just look badass. They also made me an honorary based off of my main pfp punk 😊. Just so cool. This is an easy one to rep as a pfp. https://t.co/zQjctjIaVv"
20,"Super excited to talk about my first ever advisory role for an NFT project. This one really caught my eye due to some super novel stuff.

I’m pretty sure no one is investing their life savings in NFTs, which means less long squeezes."

66,"Unit bias is real in NFTs. I'd much rather buy 10/10,000 for 1E than buy 1/1,000 for 10E. Additionally, it's not *just* a psychological bias either, as the first one is much more liquid for when I need to dump."

76,"@juulguycrypto @NotSoBigWhale @v1punks @VonMises14 I am generalizing you based on your cultural viewpoints and where you choose to allocate your capital, yes."
77,@juulguycrypto @NotSoBigWhale @v1punks @VonMises14 nah i'll be fine if v2s go to 0. it will be sad that a bunch of lowlifes like you guys took it down but that's life. i'll move on. just want to go on record as saying you guys are cringey. that was the real original point of this thread. you guys just suck as people.
78,"@juulguycrypto @NotSoBigWhale @v1punks @VonMises14 oh believe me i have a lot of experience with these types of copycat communities who try to band together opportunistically to make money. they never, ever succeed or sustain."
79,"@NotSoBigWhale @juulguycrypto @v1punks @VonMises14 relevant, yes. but not admired or revered. no one thinks you're cool bro because you pulled off a stint like this. profitable? maybe. but not successful or sustainable. most impactful thing you guys will succeed at is taking v2 down. sure whatever so be it."
80,@juulguycrypto @NotSoBigWhale @v1punks @VonMises14 ...independently succeed. Ever. Because no one wants to be associated with this type of movement or stance. There's nothing fun or unique or innovative or flex-y about it. Just a giant 'gotcha!'. Will fade into irrelevance soon enough.
81,"@juulguycrypto @NotSoBigWhale @v1punks @VonMises14 Oh I have no issue lol. You guys are free to co-exist and do w.e. You want. I just wanted to call you guys out for being some of the cringiest people in crypto I've come across in a while. 

V2 may die. V2 may die even because of V1's positioning. But V1 will never..."
82,@swigginton1 @juulguycrypto @NotSoBigWhale @v1punks @VonMises14 I didn't say your punk is fake. I said your community and philosophical foundation is fake. Really sfyl on that 250E purchase.
83,@GoingParabolic @Pauly0x @ryder_ripps Lol why am I not surprised that the guy who tried to rep a fake alien punk is again going for the 'gotcha!'
84,"@juulguycrypto @NotSoBigWhale @v1punks @VonMises14 why the change of tone? you just said ""thanks fam would love to check out your v2's sometime (as a fellow punk owner)""

I was 'fam' 10 mins ago and now you're being hostile. You guys are cringe because you're fake."
85,"@Pauly0x the real cryptopunks aren't what came first (due to an obvious, verifiable bug), but what the community deems to be legitimate. You're not gonna undo 5 years of legitimacy with a 'gotcha!'."
86,"@Pauly0x the most sought after will be what the community deems to be the ""real"" punks. this is determined by social consensus. v1 punks have an extraordinarily weak claim to being the real punks.

similar to etc vs eth. etc is the ""rEaL"" ethereum but no one cares."
87,@cryptolohy @Elypse_Pink The fact that both of you actually think I'm the CEO of punks just shows how hollow your entire philosophical stance is.
88,"@NotSoBigWhale @v1punks punks may go to 0, that's always been a risk. but i assure you, there is no prestige or flex to a 'gotcha!'. no one cares about or respects that. no one thinks that's interesting or innovative or unique or cool. it's boring and cringe and will become irrelevant soon enough."
89,"@NotSoBigWhale @v1punks and as a result, no one will buy your bag from you 10x higher, i can almost guarantee that. and we know youre not a true punks fan. so then, who is really gonna give you liquidity at the end of the day? only a finite amount of you cringey opportunists out there."
90,@NotSoBigWhale @v1punks i'm not denying any of that. i'm just asserting that the whole thing is just cringe. even if v2 goes to 0 and v1 goes to infinity the whole stance and movement is just pure cringe. it's dirty and makes everyone feel dirty. like etc did.
91,@juulguycrypto cringey af tbh lol. best of luck.
92,"@nightmayoralty disagree but fair enough. I still think punks dominate long term, and that the market is just very noisy right now. i hate being that guy but need to revisit this in 5 years."
93,"@nightmayoralty Um I 'care' about all my NFTs, both emotionally and for their cultural significance. No one *actually* cares about the significance of v1 punks. It's a faux movement to try to dump their bags.

Don't think the 'escaping communism' argument has much relevance here."
94,"@nightmayoralty But if you're trying to use larvalabs as a scapegoat to try to pump your 'gotcha' bags then that just makes you a cringey opportunist, and you will dump v1 punks first chance you get. 

And I also think this fails bc precisely 0% of v2 punk holders are selling to get v1 punks."
95,"@nightmayoralty LL's business strategy and community building has been embarrassing, and their legal strategy against phunks and v1 has been horrible. But people buying v1 punks as a way to twist the knife against LL is exactly what I mean by opportunism. None of them actually care about punks."
96,"Just like in ETH vs ETC, social consensus and community was the winner hands down. No one other than scammers and clueless opportunists care about your v1 punk."
97,"They will just slowly fade into irrelevance. Anyone flexing a v1 punk, who clearly never had a real punk or cared about punks in any way, is just incredibly cringe. And everyone knows it. Like imagine being the guy who never owned a punk and is now trying to pull a 'gotcha!'"
98,"v1 vs v2 punks feels a lot like etc vs eth. It's clear that all v1 punk owners are only ""defending"" it so they can dump their bags onto others later. There's no organic or philosophical angle here. They will also never fully die out but there's no real community either."
99,"Also, LOL at this. https://t.co/Ra1wQQaJsb"
