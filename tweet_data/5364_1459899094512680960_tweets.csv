5,"RT @richerd: When I started collecting NFTs, it was all about the art. 

It feels like its no longer all about the art..."

12,"@cryptoein @Burrbur1 @JackoD1980 @CryptoMories Can guarantee they'll never pay back the profits they made from the project, but more than happy to let everyone else lose their $$$. OpenSea is an absolute disgrace of a platform."
13,@kamakhaz @DerivativeApes 💯💯💯💯
14,@kamakhaz @DerivativeApes Still got more SODAs don't worry... I'm not leaving the SODA gang anytime soon 😎🔥
15,My 204 rarity SODA #2816 up for grabs on OS right now. Winning bidder will also receive the 1/1 custom derivatives 👀😎 #SODAtivity #SODAGang @DerivativeApes  https://t.co/ighxAIs3Ho https://t.co/SDvdHvPTW1
16,@DrawnBorn @SpicyCrazyCurry @Sony Yep. Would agree that one is a direct copy. 100%. Even down to the name of the project too.
17,@AwardRacing You’re gonna get me buying again at this rate… 😭
18,@casanova_queenn 💯💯💯💯💯💯
19,@derirfan First instinct to was to check Twitter to see if it was down... Oh wait. 🤡🤣
20,Wow. Twitter went down for like five minutes and I realised just how reliant I am on this platform 😅😬

22,@SpicyCrazyCurry @HippyDipps @Sony 100%. Law within the NFT space is applied differently than your usual IP infringements and copyright claims. So I see it a little differently in terms of where I think the line is. But fully respect that it's obviously in the ballpark and certainly enough to be debated.
23,@SpicyCrazyCurry @HippyDipps @Sony I got you. It's all good. I know factually the claim has been made and the project has been removed. I just disagree with the basis of it. No issues to disagree on this one at all.
24,@SpicyCrazyCurry @HippyDipps @Sony I hope so too buddy. 👍🏽
25,"@SpicyCrazyCurry @HippyDipps @Sony Yes. You think one way, I think another. That is disagreeing. I'm cool with that. That is agreeing. Hence agreeing to disagree. I respect your opinion, even though you don't respect mine. It's totally fine."
26,"@HippyDipps @SpicyCrazyCurry @Sony You may have misread my response. It was not an argument, simply a fact. I'm not so sure why you're so desperate to create an argument but I'm not looking for one this evening, so I'll have to pass. But hope you have a good day and all the best. It's all love."
27,"@HippyDipps @SpicyCrazyCurry @Sony Again, with respect, although admittedly it is draining from me right now, you may be surprised to find out that it isn't just the NFT industry that suffers from crime and unreliability! It's been fun, and I accept your point of view. We'll just have to agree to disagree. 👍🏽"
28,@itsjvon https://t.co/L9Af0Xx09M
29,"@HippyDipps @SpicyCrazyCurry @Sony I'd prefer not to debate this with children. Already ended this previously for you to bring it back up again this evening, so with all respect. Let that be the end of it."
30,@imdannydope @Deadfellaz @betty_nft @psych_nft 💯💯💯💯💯💯
31,"@SpicyCrazyCurry @HippyDipps @Sony Yeah I lost an argument to two people that have LBP in their profile. So shocked to see which side of the argument they're on. Already agreed to disagree respectfully, so now please get off my TL and also stfu right back at you. Appreciate it."
32,@HippyDipps @SpicyCrazyCurry @Sony Wow. I guess they must be infringing on just about every other project judging by this... 🤡
33,"My Penguins, the golem twins, all set for the race track 🐧🔥💯  #PenguinArmy #NFT #P2E @penguinkarts https://t.co/38HWCRNjhg"
34,"@SpicyCrazyCurry @Sony Again, base appearance is not the same material, colour or features so you’re not going to successfully convince me here. All the best, but this isn’t one we’re going to agree on unfortunately."
35,"@SpicyCrazyCurry @Sony It’s not a good example as it doesn’t fit the narrative. Yet 99% of them bear absolutely no resemblance to what they are supposed to be a direct copy of. Regardless, we’re never gonna see eye to eye on this so will have to respectfully agree to disagree here."
36,"@SpicyCrazyCurry @Sony Bruh, you can side with LBP due to personal affiliation all you want, but you’re not telling me this is a ‘direct copy’ of Sackboy 😂 https://t.co/2ftVdYpl5D"
37,"@SpicyCrazyCurry @Sony I guess planet of the apes is going to get BAYC cancelled and resident evil is coming after DeadFellaz if that is the standard of ‘direct copy’. Absolute nonsense. If you look at Sackboy and BBF and say they are identical, that is where we part ways respectfully."
38,"@SpicyCrazyCurry @Sony Have you checked out the project at all? There’s generative traits including multiple forms of stitching, features, colours, accessories. If that is what constitutes a direct copy then the entire NFT space is finished."
39,"@SpicyCrazyCurry @Sony Direct copy? Different traits, colour, it’s generative too. If that’s a direct copy then I guess nobody can ever make a soft toy again, either digitally or physically 😂"
40,@bysarahwanka For sure. NFT life has to take a backseat to this tragic set of events.
41,"Absolutely ridiculous. No IP or name was used and you surely cannot trademark every possible variation and utility of a fucking beanbag toy. Poor form by Ukie this, keep them in line @Sony https://t.co/ka6aoYAAWX"
42,"@RawrRobby @DerivativeApes @druu_rodriguez @casanova_queenn You call a project that hasn't been an instant flip a failure. That is where we disagree, but all the best to you too."
43,"@RawrRobby @DerivativeApes @druu_rodriguez @casanova_queenn Not news to most, but very few developers are solely involved in one project these days. Zero issues on that front. Delays suck, but would you rather delays for a finished project, or some incomplete release that will kill all potential? I know which I’d prefer."
44,@PonyZook My entire stable of A-Shapers 😂😂
45,"@RawrRobby @DerivativeApes @druu_rodriguez @casanova_queenn Been in the project since the start, not sure what children you’re seeing other than this childish insult you’re attempting. What’s the issue? What makes you think anything other than the creators/devs doing all they can to make the project a success?"
46,5am. Going to bed. Stay safe everyone.
47,"@Acircusofvalue @r_rainss I mean, the name alone will cause problems on the copyright front. There isn’t anything from Beanbag Frens that should be crossing that line though."
48,@r_rainss @Acircusofvalue Yeah. No name or IP was copied so this is a joke. You can’t trademark any and every possible variation on beanbag toys… SMH 😑☠️
49,@DigitalCoolture We live in hope 🙏🏼
50,@fomojess Sell at &gt;10eth. Buy back in post reveal dip.
51,Sure. A crypto crash sucks... But you know what sucks worse? WW3. This is just so sad to see. 😢

57,ETH down. My project floors down. Time for bed. 😅😑☠️
58,@theOGsep Sounds super intriguing. Surely everyone should be moving from OS. It's an absolute disaster of a platform.
59,@theOGsep 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
60,OK someone tell me the benefits of LooksRare... I'm just about done with OpenSea. 😑😑😑
61,@SatoshiGainz @beanbagfrens @opensea @MetaMask Hold tight bro. Hopefully all back soon!
62,These fucking scam responses. SMH. ☠️ https://t.co/9rn1oG3Duz
63,@SatoshiGainz @beanbagfrens @opensea @MetaMask Nope. OpenSea issue. Still on LooksRare and they're working on resolving so it's back on OS ASAP. All in announcements on the discord server.
64,@SatoshiGainz @beanbagfrens @opensea @MetaMask Updates are on Discord. They're resolving the issue now.
65,These are so sick. Some of the best art/design in the NFT space for sure... Gonna have to decide which NFT I want immortalised as a SuperToy soon! https://t.co/mfYwqGvXsJ

79,@longa_eth @FangGangNFT @InvalidByte @DylanMeador @Forty4Four44 @lacasadepapel Fastest getaway driver around 😎
80,@DotrousYT 8-10 I think is realistically. Something similar to what HAPE started out at.
81,This was one moment I simply had to add the the #UFCStrike collection. 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/PscCmGfsH3
82,@DotrousYT Can see it wayyyy higher that that to be honest! I might have to get involved if it’s around 1eth 😅
83,Incoming @Deadfellaz floor reset to 10eth 👀😏 https://t.co/eWZNZDcYE3
84,Floor estimates for Invisible Friends? Had some serious hype and build up to the release of this project 👀

88,Maybe it's time to look into this if you don't already have a hardware wallet. https://t.co/MrDSx6UHm8
89,@HeirbrandEthan @RoweRenders For sure. One thing is known though... OpenSea has PLENTY to answer for on this. 🤡
90,"@RoweRenders @HeirbrandEthan Still trying to figure out the cause. Not sure whether it's the migration of listings, email link or something else rn."
91,@Deadfellaz Wise and necessary move. Hope everyone stays safe from all this chaos 😭
92,OpenSea Security Department. https://t.co/fbT4glLpxq
93,@RoweRenders @HeirbrandEthan At risk of being stolen/compromised etc.

96,@BaystreetPapi Where can you check? I can't even access etherscan rn 😅
97,@ShwagzNFT Same bro. 😑
98,"@HeyYoGB This is a disaster. OpenSea is finished after this, absolute car crash of a platform."
99,"So accounts that have 'migrated listings' are at risk? Those that haven't, are not? Is that about right?"
