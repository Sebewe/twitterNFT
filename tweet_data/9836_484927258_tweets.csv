27,"@davidbarrellco No, unfortunately. Walmart. Still technically a Nikon backed store but not the best with customer service haha."
28,"@JvdLagemaat @NikonUSA They’re telling me they don’t care that I have the stuff that came in the box, they now want proof that I purchased it from Walmart. So frustrating."
29,@KevinJlew @NikonUSA @CanonUSA 20ish*. 2048 years would be a long time. 😂
30,@KevinJlew @NikonUSA @CanonUSA Uhgggg I’ve considered it. I’ve shot on nikon for 2048 h years now though and have a ton of money invested in Nikon glass. Would be more than a camera body switch.
31,"@RodPeddycoat @NikonUSA My frustration is more in the fact that I didn’t know I was buying gray market. I bought from a @nikon approved dealer, they just happened to sell me a gray market product."
32,"@rwabhm @Walmart Yeah, I am curious what they will do with this. Apparently Walmart is a certified Nikon vendor but they are notorious for being sleezeballs and putting in the small print that it is actually being sold by a 3rd party."
33,What even is life lol.
34,"Like I have the box, I have everything that came with it, but I don’t have the receipt. They said it was “grey market” without it. Like he bought it from @Walmart bro?????"
35,So @NikonUSA is like…refusing to work on my camera because they said that it isn’t a “USA based Nikon” which I have no idea what that means. They’re making me provide proof of purchase even though it was a gift from my husband 3 years ago. Like wtfffff.
