1,@rollnwthehomies So sorry to hear this Roller…I’ll call in just a bit and see if I can help at all.
2,@letmethink1402 @mecdot I agree— but asking you to validate your position that all these people are liars seems to be fair as you have made a fairly insidious accusation. Black people globally are cheering for Ukrainians…so to see this is infuriating. Imagine it.
3,@letmethink1402 @mecdot Can you explain exactly what we are SEEING then? I’m curious to hear the explanation of the multiple videos and voices we are hearing about the experience of Africans trying to survive in Ukraine right now..set the record straight if these are lies.
4,RT @mecdot: There’s always more to the story…
5,RT @mecdot: Dunno what’s wilder - listening to twitter spaces of Africans seeking refuge/watching clips of them being physically blocked fr…
6,"Throughout history hurt black people have collectively offered civility and patience and hope. When the pain becomes numbing, the civility is exhausted, and hope is gone…black rage will be all that is left. A collective sentiment of black rage to burn like a wildfire."
7,@mecdot It’s infuriating
8,Watching black people fleeing Ukrainian suffering at the hands of toxic whiteness and anti-blackness and just being abandoned because their black skin ensure they will be recognized as “sub-human” is just exhausting. Racism doesn’t take a day off…not even during an invasion.

11,@singleserving Love you too!!!
12,@singleserving I can’t help it— the ridiculousness of the hypocrisy speaks exactly to the problems they tried to gaslight us into believing weren’t real just a year or so ago.
13,@singleserving You know capitalism is king here…no empathy…well only enough empathy to raise more dollars for chicken and what not…this shit is sad.
14,@singleserving People are dying and having their country ripped apart by a man who has decided that their country has no right to exists…let the world see it.
15,I don’t think Ukrainians running for their lives or digging their heals in to fight for their lives care about “Make love not war” post.

21,Watching the largest European conflict since WWII unfold in front of our eyes makes it hard to focus on much in the Metaverse tbh.
22,If you have never prepared to do or have done battle you have know idea what Ukrainians are going through. There is nothing that compares to your back against a wall and your life on the line…nothing.
