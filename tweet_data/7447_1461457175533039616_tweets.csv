10,"RT @thedefiedge: I've studied hundreds of cognitive biases to become a better Crypto investor.

Here are the 14 most important ones:"
11,"Seeing the way @LooksRareNFT engages with the community and takes feedback seriously makes me extremely bullish on their long-term success. 

Time to buy more $looks"
12,@ASURANFTart 🍷
13,"If the value is the art, that’s great. People will continue to buy it and the mimetic cycle will be more sustainable. But if there is no real value behind the project other than prominent influencers and an extended roadmap of attention, long term success is improbable. 

/8"
14,"This cycle is extremely dangerous because it shows that price movement is almost completely unrelated to the value delivered to the collector. If NFTs are to be seen as legitimate investments, their value must be more closely correlated with the value delivered.

/7"
15,"All of this price action often happens before any real developments have been made on the project, and if the hype is not maintained either by additional large influencers or news about the project (aka attention fueling desire), the project often deflates quickly. 

/6"
16,"This increase in demand causes prices to rise quickly, resulting in purchases from more notable collectors. New collectors want in because other smart collectors are already in. Demand for the project allows the creators to tell a better story, causing the cycle to continue.

/5"
17,"This is where mimetic desire comes in. Seeing high profile influencers fashioning a particular project sparks a desire to imitate. This causes followers and other community members to buy into the project in order to be in the “in-group”. 

/4"
18,"One marketing strategy employed by new projects is to gift NFTs to high profile influencers, who then promote the project either as their PFP or in the form of a tweet. These influencers are invested in said project essentially risk free, as they have no real capital down. 

/3"
19,"Mimetic desire is a concept coined by René Girard in 1961. It states that our choices are often influenced by the desires of others. We often do this unconsciously, and it can influence anything from the career we choose, the hobbies we enjoy, or the things we buy.

31,@steve_abootman MIT is usually the standard (open source) and is declared at the top of the smart contract. Unlicense is similar but kind of confusing from a copyright perspective. Kind of interesting to look into but honestly not that big of a deal
