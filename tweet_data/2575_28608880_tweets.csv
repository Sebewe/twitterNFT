23,@killianmoore_ Facts.. seeing this really hits a nerve with me
24,"GM!

Let’s be real for a moment.

I love all the jokes but the fact that people are buying Kevin’s 8-9 ETH from a project that scammed the community out of $70 million &amp; not supporting real artists or donating to a real cause is a major problem &amp; scary sight.

Sorry but do better"
