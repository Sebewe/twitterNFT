76,"@abysms11 @niftydudes not enough haha. I like that the collection is not the obvious ""pretty"" girls. I like that it is slightly uncomfortable in that sense."
77,@abysms11 Time will tell. There are some voxel and game plans. It at least has historic significance as one of the first collection on it's own contract. It also marks a moment just before the hype exploded. Even someone else could make a game where you can use @niftydudes to play with.
78,@BLUEOR1G1N I know you appreciate old NFT gems. Have a look at this one https://t.co/pmLEyQoQVn

90,@ThomasG @niftydudes That one looks soo good!!!
91,@TeeSeeTwo @niftydudes @LeonidasNFT @garyvee Yes sir. Happy to own a part of history. It is like this collection opened 2021 and showed us what you can do with a collection.
92,@ThomasG @niftydudes @LeonidasNFT @garyvee Love it. It was great rediscovering the project today. Brings back memories. Almost one year ago exactly. How the market has changed.
93,"6. Back in 2021 it was the second MAJOR collection that launched that year. First being Hashmasks. It has 500ETH(!) volume behind it, loads of OG’s hold niftydudes and it is a verified collection on Opensea.

Oh and floor price is 0.2. GOOOOOOO!!! https://t.co/LRZGPfczh0"
94,5. The dev behind niftydudes is an experienced solidity developer that is still working on adding on chain functionality to the platform. https://t.co/rSZLdCqAaO
95,"4. Next to niftydudes there is niftysistas. How I see it probably the first female oriented collection. The crazy part is, that it is still minting!!!!. Yup you can mint a customized niftysista on the website. https://t.co/cjeL7SpEsf"
96,"3. t is a living platform. You can connect to the niftydude website, you can customize the name of your niftydude and you can claim $LOVE which you accumulate. https://t.co/ANrIKz61NA"
97,"2. It is the first Cryptopunk derivative collection. We have the bastard gan punks but I would see them more as art. Niftydudes really makes use of the properties and traits e.g. apes, zombies. You won’t find a project earlier that does this. https://t.co/dbWlFqsUyi"
98,"1. Niftydudes is a sleeper collection of 1024 pieces on it's own contract from begin March 2021(1st mint March 7th). Having a 1k collection on your own contract back then is a big deal. Most collection are still on OS Storefront contract, which we know sucks. https://t.co/nUvPY5fTvZ"
