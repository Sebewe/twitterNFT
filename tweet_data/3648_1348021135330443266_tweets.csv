64,@Zeneca_33 Don’t be an idiot Zeneca
65,Thank you #NFTCommunity for going nuts on Kevin and giving royalties to @Pixelmon. Finally I have no argument against people telling me NFTs are a scam. You all suck
66,"@corspolicy @TakeoffTone True, bit for now nfts are only used to send pics around, promise merch,  staking etc. Pretty sure that’ll change once nfts are mainstream and the demand changes. Right now it’s mostly flipping, but the NFT technology is way more than just that"
67,@corspolicy @TakeoffTone Why is that? How about fractional ownership for tv shows or real estate? Funding of let’s say a music label and the nft gives you ie Royalties and entrance to concerts?

75,"@richerd When was it ever really about the art? Been here for a year, haven’t seen much good art since then. I do remember utility, but that lost against copy/paste roadmaps that aren’t delivering"
76,"@alwaysgetpaid @GenXbyHOK Not very good in flipping, but this year leaves the impression it’s easier to flip bs derivative projects or projects that overpromise by copy/pasting the bayc roadmap than to flip solid projects that are actually building, at least not short term"
