Not multiplying price by quantity in your smart contract that has a refund mechanic depending on this output.

44,@lileddie_eth @__aizea @tom_hirst Great point 🤝
45,"@lileddie_eth @__aizea @tom_hirst We’ll plan a technical deep dive in the future, this only scratches the surface. totalSupply is a bit of a scapegoat, but for people implementing Enumerable without understanding the cost of that decision, it seems to be helping"
46,"@lileddie_eth @__aizea @tom_hirst You’re completely missing the point here. We’re well aware it isn’t totalSupply that is the main gas eater. However, if people leverage Enumerable solely for this functionality, totalSupply is the point to focus on."

53,@tom_hirst You’re on a tear
54,@bentossell Making it personal. Finding a problem you need to solve (and are invested in) and learning whatever tools necessary to solve it. Applicable to most things in life though
55,@Loopifyyy @batsoupyum @SuperRare This is the right answer. There is so much waste and way more to squeeze out of what we have now…
56,"@dievardump @__aizea @tom_hirst I agree fully. I think we underestimate how cheap “off chain” compute cycles are these days and technically “wasteful” operations have almost no overhead running as a backend process, client side process, or even API call via Graph or other system."
57,"@_happyKC @__aizea @tom_hirst Super excited that you wrapped this up and wrote about it, I’m going to give it attention tomorrow and follow up. Well done for getting it out there 🙌🏻"
58,"@dievardump @__aizea @tom_hirst I think improvements to 721E are possible, but need to be tested. If you need Enumerable functionality, use OpenZeppelin, otherwise, dump it and move on. Happy to have you as part of this discussion, getting these conversations started is the most important part 🤝"
59,@dievardump @__aizea @tom_hirst What I will say on the topic of sub-ins is that people are moving too quick and declaring victory. There are a number of Enumerable replacements that have not been battle tested at scale. I’m of the mind that reduction is the best option this moment.
60,"@dievardump @__aizea @tom_hirst It’s good to discuss alternatives publicly, as it’s clearly having a positive impact for projects. This isn’t common knowledge unless we talk about it. You can certainly use uint256 as a sub for Counter"

65,@CathalUK 👀👀👀
66,@nathancycles @tom_hirst Well done!
67,@squeebo_nft @nftchance @invadereth @alphagirlclub @ToyBoogers @tom_hirst I think this is the key point in all of this 🤝
68,"@nftchance @squeebo_nft @invadereth @alphagirlclub @ToyBoogers @tom_hirst @OpenZeppelin That looks great! The biggest thing here was we proposed something that anyone could swap out and have comparable gas figured to what you just linked. There are always different solutions. We have the same goals, sharing all of this helpful for everyone 🤝"
69,"@nftchance @squeebo_nft @invadereth @alphagirlclub @ToyBoogers @tom_hirst @OpenZeppelin On all mints after mint 1 (as the Counter is initialized with a 0 value, which has a higher gas cost than incrementing &gt;1) they will be 75k/163k or less per mint"
70,@nftchance @squeebo_nft @invadereth @alphagirlclub @ToyBoogers @tom_hirst @OpenZeppelin Can you provide the 1/5 mint gas usage for your suggested fix? I don’t look at $ costs as it’s highly variable. Ours (using this direct sub out) is ~92k/180k (only relevant on mint 1) by incrementing the counter in the constructor this is reduced to 75k/163k
71,"@nftchance @squeebo_nft @invadereth @alphagirlclub @ToyBoogers @tom_hirst @OpenZeppelin I agree, Enumerable needs to be reworked. However our suggestions offer a sub out with another OZ library. Would love to look at txs with your optimizations!"
72,@squeebo_nft Would love to hear more about your thoughts on this. Only goal here is to keep sharing and learning!
73,@squeebo_nft @nftchance @invadereth @alphagirlclub @ToyBoogers @tom_hirst Agreed!
74,"@nftchance @squeebo_nft @invadereth @alphagirlclub @ToyBoogers @tom_hirst We’re well aware that totalSupply() is not the core issue, but if people are leveraging Enumerable exclusively for this functionality, totalSupply is an important talking point. This offers an alternative anyone can deploy if it fits the use case."
75,@nftchance @squeebo_nft @invadereth @alphagirlclub @ToyBoogers @tom_hirst We wrote an article about people using Enumerable along with the function they tend to leverage. Proposing a quick replacement if it fits the use case and to continue the conversation forward. Not sure what your issue is here?
76,"@nftchance @squeebo_nft @invadereth @alphagirlclub @ToyBoogers @tom_hirst Care to explain, not sure I follow this thread?"

79,@BillyM2k What happens if they DO want to talk about crypto…
80,"@Jishai Added a PR, don’t feel like any of it needs to be implemented but is the way I would approach it. None of it is actually tested (only one coffee deep this morning) hopefully it helps!"
81,"@Jishai Yeah this would be pretty expensive, should have something slightly simpler for you. All depends on when the addresses are whitelisted, all at once in the constructors, or ad hoc (also I’d recommend getting comfy with hardhat if you’re not already!)"
82,@Jishai Do it up!
83,@Jishai I have a couple other notes if you want some constructive feedback 👋🏻
84,"@Jishai Then you could just have a lookup function, decrement quantity for an address, and go from there. Looping over the whitelist to check would be expensive"
85,"@Jishai Expensive in what way? Deployment side?

This is actually on my list to dive into more, simple mapping address to quantity in the constructor could work (calls public add to whitelist function) could also pack values into a struct and map address &gt; struct"
86,@Jishai Also just shoot me a dm so these Twitter bots don’t spam this conversation haha
87,"@Jishai So the only thing you should touch on the frontend is max gas, this is the max number of gas units a tx uses based on your testing. I never recommend setting a gas price (metamask can do this). Post 1559, as long as it’s a type 2 tx the user will not pay more than base+priority"
88,@zachxbt This looks like a Fiverr logo design portfolio
89,"@Jishai Happy to answer any questions you have! Where are you getting stuck? It’s important to start with what the hell it is first, and then move into how it’s priced, and how that impacts transactions (pre/post 1559)"
90,"@MichaelOpenSea AFAIK, you just have to tell people you’re accumulating bitcoins"
91,@gabagooldoteth @DAOofDiamonds Well done 👌🏻
92,@tomosman I concur.
93,@Jishai @tom_hirst I bet the next mint from the same address is even cheaper ;)
94,@Jishai @tom_hirst Great to hear! What was the gas consumed if you don’t mind me asking?
95,"@rickeccak @thedigitalvee Appreciate that! Our goal was to get the conversations out there so that we can keep fostering growth in our community. Thanks for being a part of that conversation!

cc @tom_hirst"
96,"@rickeccak @thedigitalvee This is the exact discussion I wanted to stir up! On a few projects that’s the methodology we’ve gone with. Either to store ownership separately, and validate it in contract, or perform this expensive loop on the frontend. Depends on use case. Appreciate your POV on the topic 🤝"
97,"@rickeccak @thedigitalvee Not suggesting that it’s a good idea at all, just countering the statement that you “LOSE the ability” to find tokens owned by an address. We, as devs, have a responsibility to explore all options. Especially when it costs end users $$$"
98,@ryancarson 🙌🏻
99,"@thedigitalvee Technically this is not correct. The standard ERC721 implementation has balanceOf and ownerOf. Which means that you can perform these actions on chain if absolutely necessary. Slightly more challenging, sure, but good devs are always up for a challenge."
