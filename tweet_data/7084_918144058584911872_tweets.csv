1,"@0xHelvetii @yoshishibutoken Always difficult to gauge! I fancy it has a peep at something around $10m, does it retreat from there or break it and go big time? Worth a hold to find out."
2,"Interesting new ERC20 launch play on here I have taken a stake in at $1m #YOSHISHIBU

They have a bespoke contract with unique tokenomics that allows for buy backs without the initial native token sale. Genius. 

Take a peep:

5,"@BlockChainBOOM Will hold this for a while and move in and out. Almost using it as an ETH alternative as it's so solid, out performs big coin and no tax 🤷‍♂️ and that's before you getc into the utility!"

7,@BlockChainBOOM Outstanding dog lad!  Enjoying a nice ride on $WRLD token from .079 here 😏
8,"#SHIBTAMA peaked at $8m and, as is the way on new pairs, followed the TAMA plays down to a circa $1m low. 

Recovering nicely now, making higher lows &amp; at circa $2m. I continue to back this play given the relentless drive of the Dev team. 

Target $50m+

I understand the nock on derivatives, many being low effort cash grabs. But with the quality work &amp; community behind it, I believe @0xApes_NFT will benefit from the coming Ape Run. https://t.co/dIXTEFVHmP"
18,"The ""TAMA"" hybrid plays running hot, my pick of the bunch is #SHIBTAMA. Based team delivering everything promised ahead of schedule. Initial entry was $800k but, given its peers have run up past $50M, there's plenty legs left here from circa $4.5M
