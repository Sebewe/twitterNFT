10,"@Grey_Shadowz @BAYC2745 @psychedelic_nft Don’t disqualify yourself on the basis of limitating beliefs. You dont have to pitch anything complex. Pitch something you have a natural affinity to solve, even if seemingly small, and find like-minded people with complementary skills to join you. 

Avalanches start small."

14,"@gulsoeth @NYDoorman @JohnKnopfPhotos Rich is a very relative term. 

Median US household income is $67k. So it’s roughly 15 years of household income in the US. In Russia it would be 50 years. In India almost 200x, Bangladesh 400x. 

Your reality is not the only one."

19,@matthisdraws @superfinity This looks absolutely amazing! 🤌🏻🔥
20,@IamLostKeys @e_turgeneva I dont disagree. But the fact is that for most buyers it will be hard to identify copy-pasta because of the sheer volume out there that can be copied. Until something gets large-scale attention these things will sadly mostly go unnoticed.

24,"@joshbobrowsky @littlelauchie @veefriends @worldofwomennft What is the network effect of mfers? 

The def is that each additional node in a network/system increases the value for all existing nodes (eg the telephone; the more ppl you can call, the higher value to own a phone)."
