28,@SamEllisNFT Wow congrats man 🙌😍
29,@Amy03685808 @netflix @DavidYuNZ @ecomi_rhys @veve_official Great point! Agreed 🙌
30,@finch_crypto Shouldn’t*
31,@finch_crypto I think that’s fair! Should bid unless you’re serious imo
32,@ZappZaddy https://t.co/mxuXp4754c
33,@Crypt0Badger @Miniman271 @chieffillipz Yes totally agree 😉
34,@Crypt0Badger @chieffillipz That would be fair 😜
35,@Crypt0Badger @chieffillipz Don’t feel like 72hr is enough tbh
36,@Crypt0Badger https://t.co/AL6iLwWQoX
37,"@chieffillipz Sure I get that 😛

Just think it’s something that needs to get fixed, otherwise what’s the point of selling anything on the market if anyone can just bid and not pay. See what I mean?"
38,@YeebennyG @Eggsplorers DMed you 👋
39,@jayvelasco94 @CoolCryptoKids @latimes @MakeMarchMatter @ChildrensLA So exciting 🙌
40,"Everyone seeing this? 👀

Veve should probably fix this, because it feels like anyone is throwing bids at this point (without the intention of actually paying) 😅 https://t.co/OhW0m2BUDH"

48,"@EmilioCostaJ Wow that’s great! Yes you’re totally right, gotta do what feels right! I think I might do the same!"
49,@gabe1718 Ya really thinking about it! I would personally rather have the Aston! Think I might do it
50,@AxiePortal My pleasure ❤️
51,Is it worth flipping some SR comics for the UR Aston Martin? Honestly considering it 🤔
52,"@AVevecollector @SamEllisNFT @VeveDope @VeVeVault @VeVeViral @Gastou_NFT @rayfixy @VeveUniversal @steveyphil92 @nft_pirates Ouff that’s a hard one! It really comes down to personal preference I think! I personally would go for UR Mickey, but superman has also a lot of potential too 🙏🔥 Both are Ws though"

58,@ebikeadvocate Name a single project with better IP than VeVe. I’ll wait 😌
59,"@CollectStuffInc I think that’s taking it too literally. What we mean is that Amazon is the biggest player in e-commerce. Veve will do the same, but instead will do it in the world of NFTs and Web3. Will they follow a similar model of endless supply? No. Will veve be the biggest player? Yes."
