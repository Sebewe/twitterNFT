23,"@schult_tobias @QuantumNFT @0xbrileigh Adapting older lenses to a digital sensor? Not really, I only shot with APO-Sironar-S lenses on 4x5 and don’t really see the appeal of optical flaws on sensors that are astoundingly clean like the GFX or Phase. But I’ve heard older optics can help “soften” the harsh output 🔪"
24,"@schult_tobias @QuantumNFT @0xbrileigh GFX 100S outclasses 4x5 on a technical level by a long shot, esp. with pixel shift. The bigger question is whether you can live with the tonality and wider dynamic range, it certainly looks “different”."

57,8/ That's all for now. I'll continue to scan found images from my archive for future drops and will share them in threads like this or articles on @viamirror. Thanks to @obscuradao and @Felix_Denomme + @OliverWDahl for organizing this great project 🎞️📽️
58,"7/ These orphaned images bring us to the realization that the lives of others are as complex as our own, that each image is a sliver of the photographer's life, their memories, and their experiences. https://t.co/ezC3prAUDX"
59,"6/ Who was the photographer, what was their name, where did they live? What were they thinking about when they pressed the shutter? Who did they love and what did they fear? https://t.co/fTXHz0k48p"
60,"5/ As photographers and artists, we are drawn to the nostalgia and ambiguous narratives of found images: they cause us to ask questions which we often can't answer. This playful sense of mystery and the unknowable brings us to look at them again and again. https://t.co/SPp2niFopY"
61,"4/ As micro-collections of themes, locations, and subject matter develop within the larger archive, previously orphaned images will find new meanings and new potential as they are grouped together and recontextualized. https://t.co/Fr3FErBSVD"
62,"3/ Bringing these found images to the blockchain gives them another life and creates opportunities for property/rarity traits like format, film stock, location, subject matter, etc. https://t.co/WlP5kP7V3k"
63,"2/ Carousel Curated is an ongoing catalog of found slides submitted by the @obscuradao community that will be released as 1/1 NFTs. Each drop will contain 80 images selected from submissions, mimicking the tray capacity of the original Kodak Carousel slide projector 📽️ https://t.co/HjzNLwn5jM"
