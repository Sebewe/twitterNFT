1,An interesting trait gamers tend to have is an unopen mind to games made for other people.   They get hostile towards games they don’t like but other people do consistently.

18,Hot take: the alien punk that sold for 8000 eth has a better chance of holding its value than a floor punk.
19,I can predict the reaction of telling a friend that a punk sold for 8000 eth based on if I need to add ($24mm) or if I can just keep the denomination in eth only.

66,@TaschaLabs Isn’t the idea that what would be the dividend gets reinvested into Amazon resulting in more future cash flow for when they eventually do start paying out a dividend?
67,If any of my followers could eli5 I am wondering why Solana inherently could not be a rollup on top of Ethereum without it’s throughput being bottlenecked by Ethereum according to @aeyakovenko https://t.co/Xmv47Jn8MK
68,@aeyakovenko @joincoinsider Can you eli5 this?   Does this imply that rollups are inherently bottlenecked by the underlying chain?   Can you give explicit numbers for the throughput?  What is solana doing differently to get this throughput?   Would solana benefit from its own rollups?
69,@keridwen_eth @crypto_coven This is awesome!
70,Reminds me of my 80% vpip playing in Columbus Ohio. https://t.co/O9e2H26dhC
71,I don’t expect an extended bear market though.   We finally reached a point where useful dapps are possible to build and so many people are building.
72,"Fourthly, I anecdotally believe solana has been onboarding developers from outside of crypto.   Existing crypto developers tend to stick with evm.   A bear market hurts solanas ability to recruit developers to reach parity with evm chains."
73,"Thirdly, I believe “token goes up” is ultimately the best feature driving hype around solana."
74,"Another thing going against them is if people are building for the long term and not to capitalize on momentum today, evm chains specifically Ethereum are by far the safest bet to build on."
75,Hot take: I don’t think solana could withstand an extended bear market if it happens.   The biggest reason is I believe the industry completely consolidates around the evm.

78,Do I buy the dip or do I buy chips and dip?
79,"@metamhjr So this is a good example.   If the stock is valuable stock buybacks are going to drive the price up.   But if the stock is just vapor, using buybacks as a reason to call the stock valuable would be a ponzi."
80,@norswap Well over 50% of my net worth is in eth so I didn’t mean to word it like I think eth is a ponzi.   Just the shillers shilling it sound like they are shilling a ponzi like you said.
81,@metamhjr To be fully transparent well over 50% of my net worth is in eth.
82,@metamhjr So what I was specifically talking about was specific eth shillers who I won’t name who act like the tokenomics of burning eth are the main reason to be bullish on eth and never talk about the actual value.   Badly worded by me.
83,@norswap Also curious if the lack of layer 1 smart contracts has negative trade offs.
84,@norswap Yea that’s an obvious one that since it’s so much light weight it should have better velocity.   I am curious if it has any inherent performance benifits.
85,@norswap Yea not well worded from me.   I get it and agree it’s true.   I guess what I mean to say is sometimes I hear people talk about it as the main value proposition of eth which if true would be ponzinomics.

90,I suspect there are inherent advantages celestia has over Ethereum but no matter how hard I look I can’t find an explanation of what they are.
91,"Crazy solana idea.   Roll it up, stick 1000 instances of it on top of celestia/cosmos.   Give each instance it’s own specialization.   One gaming instance.  5 payment instances. 2 defi instances."

94,Loling at “I’m bullish on bear markets” @RyanSAdams @BanklessHQ
95,Nfts on solana is such a pointless waste.   The entire value proposition is scaling without sharding in exchange for interoperability.   It’s such a waste to stick nfts on it instead of using its entire block capacity for defi or something that properly leverages it.
