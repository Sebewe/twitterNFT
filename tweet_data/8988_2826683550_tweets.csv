13,Can we finally say HAPE PRIME pulled a MekaVerse 2.0 or not yet?
14,@nyrNFT Oh man. Sorry to heae. I’m out of liquidity but thankfully I still hold my alien fren. End of the day it’s just money. Money comes and goes. More important things in life. Stay safe brotha.
15,@nyrNFT Beanbag Frens. Delisted from OS.
16,I lost about an ETH today but there are worst things happening in the world. Really puts things into perspective. Praying for all those affected.
17,@Helloimmorgan Pls tell me you sold. 12 ETH just turned into 9 ETH in the matter of mins. Take friggin profit.
18,@Helloimmorgan Sell immediately pls
19,You’d think people would have learned with HAPEBEAST. People are gonna be buying IF for 11-15 ETH &amp; panic sell for 3-5 ETH in few weeks time.
20,@lisabell04 Feels like just a matter of time until the mories hit 3 ETH.
21,@TheDropoutHulu #unsubscribe
22,@jake_spitty You profited $23.9K. The new buyer has a chance to accept that offer for a profit of only $14K. You're the winner here.
23,@burnpile_eth Ooo yes…solid. SupDucks is dope. Almost bought one last week.
24,@RocketMan_NFT Quirkies community pretty tough. Alien Frens as well.
25,What’s one undervalued project you don’t own that you’re most bullish on? For me it’s DeadFellaz. I don’t have one but I think they can go hella far.
26,@SpacebooNFT Need a boolist 😩
27,OpenSea on mobile is literally unusable with filters because of their stupid announcement banners.

63,3D NFT’s are literally the worst.
64,@wilson_eth Let’s talk about banks. Banks launder between $800 billion to $2 trillion per year 😅

66,Shout-out @RocketMan_NFT &amp; @BoredGutterCats for sending me my Bored Gutter Cat canvas 💯 going straight to the wall ✊🏽 https://t.co/hDL9Us7FIg
67,Grinding for WL spots is ridiculous in my opinion. I’m not trying to be a slave to a project. The fact that I’m willing to put in my HARD EARNED MONEY into your project should be more than enough.

A 2.3 ETH sale gives you back 2.08 ETH.
A 2.18 ETH buy with gas is 2.21 ETH.

A waste of 0.13 ETH."
