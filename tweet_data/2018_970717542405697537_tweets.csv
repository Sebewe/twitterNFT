4,"@CryptoMories @iwwon_official In the spirt of #spreadthelove I’ll send someone one of these paintings. All you have to do is like this post and follow @FrankJamesTV by 11:59pm March 2, 2022. I’ll pay for shipping and you can choose which one you want. #FaMorie #SSFUnited #MORIELOVE"
5,@CryptoMories What came to mind when I saw this was the pour-over painting I have been doing with my partner. She is a painter and used to do photography but we both enjoy working on these together as she listens to me talk about NFTs #MORIELOVE #FaMorie #SSFU @iwwon_official https://t.co/Wdp3s39Ovr
6,@PoppyzNFT @SSF_NFT @paul_gogue @joebarbea @iwwon_official They'll all be a part of the iwwon project and they are a free mint pass to Lejopan. .05 is a steal
