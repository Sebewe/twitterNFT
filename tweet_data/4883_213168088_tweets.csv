35,".@chensonmusic has done history for the media composers community and we thank you for that. Excited to see this new endeavor. Not sure it’s another crazy sampling experiment, or a mere business diversification. https://t.co/jE7isOY9GZ"
36,"17/ Finally, @bchesky chat with @karaswisher was brilliant, fun and inspiring: 

“The line between traveling and living is blurring” 

“The internet is going to become more 3D. If not done right, this can be very dangerous”"
37,"16/ Latin America is currently at VC funding revolution. There're many problems to solve + amazing talent. People don't necessarily want to leave Latam, but raise capital and build there. “In the past 3 years the amount of venture capital in Latin America has 10x” 
@snyatta"
38,"15/ Everyone is aware about Miami's boom in tech. However, one of the missing pieces -that takes time and financial resources, is education: “Florida needs a massive investment in public schools” said Prof G on the #Miami start up ecosystem. @profgalloway @PivotPod"
39,"14/ .@JonHaidt had one of the deepest conversations about our relationship with social media. “Anxiety, suicide and depression were stable in early 2000, and tripled in 2012, specially on women. This is directly linked to social media” 
@PivotPod"
40,"13/ Media companies now are tired of the middle man. “We need a direct relationship with our readers, with no tech platforms in the middle” @meredith_levien CEO @nytimes at @PivotPod"
41,12/Audio hasn't change that much in the past decade. We still listen to podcast in a very old fashion way. Interesting to hear @meredith_levien CEO @nytimes say“We’re at the beginning of a new era audio”. I hope to see more interactive experiences in the audio. @PivotPod #podcast
42,"11/ I was surprised to hear @DavidSolomon, CEO @GoldmanSachs, say: ""NFTs are super interesting, it’s the evolution of collectibles”. Would love to hear his thoughts/concerns about #DeFi

47,6/ “It used to be 20% of story telling and 80% of intrinsic value. Now it’s flipped” @profgalloway
48,5/ .@profgalloway predictions were one of the highlights of the event. Here some of my fav quotes:
49,4/ The life cycle of tech companies is getting shorter and shorter. General Motors is a grandpa. Microsoft is a grandpa.
50,3/ .@AswathDamodaran did an analogy between companies and people age. Start up companies are babies that need a lot of attention. Teenage companies are more emotional and less consistent. Then you've adults and grandpas that are more reliable but can quickly become obsolete.
51,"2/ Crypto and NFT views in general were pretty skeptical. A few months ago I was at @NFT_NYC and everyone was all in. In @PivotPod the audience was very different. Most of the speakers where cautious, or not informed/interested. Interesting to see both sides of the coin."
