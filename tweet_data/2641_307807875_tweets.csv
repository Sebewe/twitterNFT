11,@Stoniphantom Congratulations mate. Or for a similar price… https://t.co/1X50UUQjIj
12,"@NFTatitsbest @WillyTheDegen Yeah, they over-promised. And it sounds like the game was was functionally working but they were targeted with various attacks. So they need to do more work, but I think it will be great when they get there."
13,@smems_ 📈
14,"@WillyTheDegen The plan is clear, the delivery has been the issue. That’s not a rug. It’s a soft rug if they stop bothering to try. Which obviously isn’t happening."
15,"@WillyTheDegen I’m sure you’re joking, but clearly it’s not any form of rug. They should take time to get it right and stop rushing to meet the ludicrous timeline expectations of the NFT space. But they should also learn the lesson to under promise."
16,"After missing out on a wonderlist spot I was very fortunate to mint a @WonderPals on the raffle losers second chance mint. Not going to lie, I enjoyed the buzz of a mini gas war. 

Looking forward to the reveal! 💛 https://t.co/OCDNjEKbxd"

38,Over the past few weeks I must have seen 10 promising projects that could have sold out at 0.06 eth but completely flopped at 0.15-0.25.
39,@itstheNFT4me @BoredApeYC I like the scavenger hunt. I will send the first finder a gift…
40,Somewhere in the world 🤘 @BoredApeYC https://t.co/aYcrV3cn9f
41,@ogallanoby One for the connoisseurs. I should have tagged @BoredApeYC
42,You wouldn’t believe the state of the bathroom #MAYC https://t.co/KNZyJqAIsN
43,"If you’re launching an NFT project over the coming days and weeks and planning to charge 0.2 eth + for a mint, you need to get a grip on reality."
44,"We knew this was coming, but hard not to be shocked by the images from Ukraine. Thoughts and prayers with everyone affected."
45,Hard reality check for people overexposed to crypto and NFTs. Thinking of you 🤝
46,"@howdyoufindme @NFTArtCritic @Wader012 @hotlneblng_ Agreed, it’s definitely important to debate these things if you’ve got a valuable volatile asset. Important to also think about your overall portfolio and what you are trying to achieve. Personally Meka and Hape are important reference points, but a small sample size."
47,"@howdyoufindme @NFTArtCritic @Wader012 @hotlneblng_ Did you mint? If so, congratulations, that’s awesome. It’s going to be fascinating to see how it goes."
48,What will the floor for Invisible Friends be in 2 months time?
49,"@howdyoufindme @NFTArtCritic @Wader012 @hotlneblng_ The hype for meka was very similar. It might do well, but it’s hard for any project to stay above 5 eth, it needs more than hype. Do we know about any significant planned utility? The reveal will be crucial, it needs to meet the high expectations."
50,@howdyoufindme @NFTArtCritic @Wader012 @hotlneblng_ It feels like that now. But Mekaverse and Hape have been here before.
51,@howdyoufindme @NFTArtCritic @Wader012 @hotlneblng_ It will go down below 5 eth. But at that stage people won’t want it because it will have dropped over 50% and the FOMO will be gone.
52,"@amazzara1 No. I didn’t know anyone who bought Mekaverse pre reveal, I’ve come across one or two who bought Hape, and not yet aware of anyone buying IF. I struggle to see the upside."
53,"Honest question, have you bought an Invisible Friends on secondary?"
54,"@smems_ @Twitter @TwitterBlue Hex is massively devalued because people can verify copy pasta rip-offs. But agree we should have the option outside the US, otherwise it makes people question if we are verified, which means we are worse off thanks to the hexagon."
55,@JoseColchao Oh I saw he was trying to make contact. Could easily be over 3k then!
56,"@JoseColchao I would have said the same yesterday, but feels like it could be more now. Could be over 3k eth…"

58,"@foxslightly AND a UK ape too, what a double. @LordTruffington"
59,So bullish listening to the founders talk on the Mega Mutant Reveal. @BoredApeYC
60,"@Bas01056 Ideally… build the project before building hype, set a sensible mint price, open the mint and let it sell organically. But almost all projects are built on hype these days, to some extent. Failing that, 100% raffle and collabs. Zero spots for “engaging”."
61,"@tobylasso Thanks for sharing Toby. I, like so many, have huge respect for you. ❤️ 🤝"
62,@ShaneCultra @Sedo Quite like UpYo
63,Nothing beats being a member of the yacht club. @BoredApeYC https://t.co/bhzuepxXqV
64,"@CDCamb @PUMA @coolcatsnft @GutterCatGang @CatBloxStudios @LazyLionsNFT I think something bigger, but I don’t have any insight… 👀"
65,@CDCamb It’s totally out of hand. Almost every project is rewarding grinding even if they claim they don’t. Mint prices are also ridiculous.
66,"Some of the stories I’ve heard about grinding for whitelist (unsuccessfully in many cases) are beyond belief. It’s borderline abusive by projects and should be called out and stopped.

And if you claim your project discourages grinding but reward active members, you’re in on it."
67,@TheApeList_ @koonimalsnft Excited about this one ☝️
68,Just my luck… logged on to buy another BYOLand from @BYOPills and the price has doubled since this morning 🤦‍♂️
69,"So @PUMA have changed their Twitter name to PUMA.eth and bought @coolcatsnft, @GutterCatGang, @CatBloxStudios and @LazyLionsNFT.  Something is purring."
70,So much happening right now in the UK @BoredApeYC community. https://t.co/GUHVIQrPik
71,"It’s great to see new projects moving on from “Grind for whitelist” to “Don’t grind for whitelist, we will be choosing active and engaged members of our community for our whitelist” 🤔"

81,@TheApeList_ @ClementinesGame Seriously impressive AMA. A team that has been building for years. I’m delighted to have minted 💎 🙌
82,@HarryBTC @adidasoriginals I just bought back in. I think what has happened with RTFKT and Nike will influence how Adidas play this. They will want to add big value to holders I imagine. I wouldn’t be surprised to see this yield significant utility this year and 1.5 will look very cheap. But who knows/NFA!

84,@HarryBTC @adidasoriginals My guess is this will be about a lot more than a tracksuit and a hoodie…

88,@clyndonsmith @adidasoriginals So many ifs and buts in this game. Still could be a great entry point.
89,@HamsterzOP @adidasoriginals 😭
90,That’s a bullish looking chart @adidasoriginals https://t.co/FztKz38Jg9
91,The number of times @opensea deletes a genuine project listing instead of a scam listing is beyond incredible. They can’t have the most basic processes and checks in place.

97,"RT @TheTick3t: 🚨 FAN’S CHOICE GIVEAWAY 🚨

@TheTick3t hit 1500 followers, so we are giving away 2 TICK3TS to the event of your choice! 🏒 🥊⚾️…"
98,@CalcioNFT @WeatheReportNFT This is the biggest takeaway for me. It's a bit like a disgruntled employee going to the tabloids and then the company being told they should invite them to the board meeting.
99,"The more I listen to the @WeatheReportNFT space, the more sympathy I have for the team. Seems like they've tried to do the right thing. The implications of teams having to public defend themselves against anyone with an axe to grind is tough."
