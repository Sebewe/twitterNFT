88,@LooksRareNFT At least having an async job that runs each day to clear out invalid bids should exist imo to avoid having stale offers give false impressions
89,@LooksRareNFT is it possible to remove invalid bids on collections? UX for this is confusing right now because most of these offers are now invalid (not enough WETH in their wallets) https://t.co/4HgFfI2uUt
