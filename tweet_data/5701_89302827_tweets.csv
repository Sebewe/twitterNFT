18,I see all these people with 96 font on their phones and I cringe because we can all see the convo. Then I realize I can’t hear “so good” and often nod my head yes and agree with people. I’m never changing my font size as my eyes go bad and will just type random things in response

43,@Conscious_NFT I’ll be out of town that weekend but very much look forward to the IRL aspect of this project as much as the metaverse aspect
44,@FunkmasterAmp The interesting part is that the author wants to invest in Flexa if/when it goes public without realizing you can reap transaction rewards now through staking AMP. Imagine the bag we will be sitting on by the time institutional investors get a chance at Flexa shares!

1. Started with $BTC: read Layered Money, Mastering Bitcoin, and The Bitcoin Standard.

79,2021 was a year of rabbit holes with interesting realizations. Going to summarize my favorite ones in a 🧵
80,@FunkmasterAmp @chamath I recently read the $ACH white paper as a devils advocate for $AMP…ACH requires merchants to run their own node if I understood it correctly. The merchants also get rewarded in ACH. 2 things Flexa intentional avoided.
81,@FunkmasterAmp @DeojayDan @FlexaHQ I haven’t listened to the latest pod…this is a good signal. Flexa is poised to be a massive multi-decade play for everyone getting in at $0.5!

94,"@Hermit_Thrush @JessFerringer Keg economics don’t work that way. Many kegs lose money because the system isn’t dialed in (wrong temp, pressure imbalance, unclean beer lines). You can only divide cost of keg by number of beers poured. If that number is off, your price model will fail."
