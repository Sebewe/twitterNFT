40,"+ @Metromile has built an enterprise software business that provides traditional insurers with a modern claims experience. Although still new and small (~$5m ARR), this is something we hoped to get to one day, so we’re excited to get started early!"
41,We’re also excited about the opportunities of having both a fixed-fee and pay-per-mile policy available for our customers!
42,"We plan to have a single experience, and a single tech stack. @Metromile’s per-mile model will run on the @Lemonade_inc platform. But if you’re a Metromile customer - nothing changes for the foreseeable future! Just continue driving safely and enjoy your Metromile policy."
43,Over the years @Metromile were able to iterate and perfect their usage based insurance algorithms. They’re now in the process of deploying their 3rd generation risk prediction and pricing models.
44,".@Metromile’s customers report 47% savings on average, while their loss ratio is within 10% of Geico and Progressive’s direct business."
45,We’ll incorporate @Metromile’s precision pricing models into our existing car product to accelerate its path to profitability
46,"The deal will allow us to expand faster - @Metromile is licensed in 49 states, and live in 8, including California"
47,The 380 people strong @Metromile team will join the @Lemonade_Inc team to accelerate the growth of our new car business
48,".@Metromile’s comes with more than $100mm of in-force premium, about 100,000 loyal customers, and more than $250m in cash"
49,".@Metromile brings 10 years of closed-loop telematics and machine learning models trained on +3,000,000,000 miles of driving data"
50,"We looked at dozens of companies for potential M&amp;A over the years, but none materialized. That is, until we’ve met the @Metromile team"
51,"Shortly after launching our own car insurance, we’re stoked to be adding the @Metromile team to the @lemonade_inc family!"
