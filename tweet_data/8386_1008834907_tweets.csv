1,"One of the bizarre side effects of NFT and Web3 projects is that not only do founders and business development people feel like it's okay to throw f-bombs and mfer around like they are your school buddy, but somehow they feel compelled to. Sometimes it feels incredibly forced."
2,"3/The big one for March though is Garden Day aka Spring Equinox - Generally around March 21st. Do some gardening, get outside, feel the soil under your bare feet. Review your goals and aspirations for the year. Meditate on happiness. Gather with friends."
3,"2/ March 14th is world Pi Day. On this day we celebrate math and eat pie. Sharing pie with math lovers is a very Bald Jesus thing to do. If you are baking pies, cut the pi symbol in the top of your pie!"
4,"#BaldJesus holidays coming up:
1/ Full Moon 'Sugar Moon'  on March 17th -  share sweet treats with kids and the people we love and take the day off work if you can. Enjoy yourself."

29,@adamamcbride @RemindMe_OfThis I would love to live long enough to watch some sort of Geraldo style special opening up the Bald Jesus Collective Vault - lofl - the OG vault is on Wax.

32,"This is the start of the thread @adamamcbride - by the way, enjoying your book. Some funny parallels in our journeys - I took the Hawaii pill https://t.co/oelrfxcRko"
33,Hey @adamamcbride - I forgot to tag you on this... https://t.co/5VDYpD4idJ
34,This is the #alpha and the #omega https://t.co/mIDeltPWzV
35,"and as someone who was silly enough to go to school and spend time working to become a qualified archaeologist IRL, I can tell you that religious archaeology is a big deal. This is the alpha frens – Don’t sleep on Bald Jesus."
36,"If it’s not now, Bald Jesus is definitely going to be on his radar in the future – it’s the first NFT religion born on the blockchain,"
37,All of this comes to mind especially as I read Adam McBride’s book “NFT Ape” – you’ve probably heard Adam on podcasts or seen him mentioned in the news – he’s the ‘Digital Archaeologist’ who looks for important collections in the NFT world.
38,"These are the ones drawn by our @BJ-Artists – and I freely admit, often much better artists than I am. These prices will also be disappearing in the great floor reset. https://t.co/3PDk5LQ3S6"
39,"It means you’ve got two days to scoop up OG BJs for little more than the gas price. Currently there are 11 OG BJs sitting at .001 – https://t.co/dy302JgUyN
There are also a couple dozen of the OG Bald Jesus Collective BJs sitting at the same price."
40,"of course, all these prices are going to be cancelled in a couple of days when OS resets and my thought is to set the floor of all the BJs I still have at something like .05 ETH. So, what does that mean?"
41,At some point – Bald Jesus is going to get the attention of an influencer or a media story because we are not going to disappear. I’ve got all the original OG Bald Jesus NFTs listed for these kind of giveaway prices –
42,Bald Jesus #2 (the second BJ ever made on ETH chain) which was a hand-drawn BJ digitized and lazy minted on OpenSea sold last night. The price was .001 ETH – right around $3. It’s crazy to me – but I’m stoked for the buyer.
43,@maxgbae @ProblySomething I've looked around but the best I've found is an aggregator that let's you put multiple discord accounts in one place which really just compounds the problem...
44,"@ProblySomething @maxgbae Well...that got me to follow you, no problem."
45,@TommyMendleski My latest should fix that soon... that's a really strange pfp (profile pic)...what NFT collection is it from?
46,I heard that Queen Elizabeth II is actually on a rocket that is supposed to slam into the moon soon and was launched by the ESA in secret. If true - this would make her the absolute greatest of all time in any category.  #QueenElizabethII #rocket #moon https://t.co/r092Z7Z4rJ
47,"If the world were serious- the US and allies should conduct an oh-shit nuclear test by either blowing up an asteroid nicknamed ""Moscow"" or ""Beijing""  not freeze some oligarchs western bank accounts."
48,There is virtually no reason for Putin not to invade Ukraine and almost no reason for China not to take Taiwan. I mean consequences reasons - the world is making this easy for them.
49,@maxgbae I totally agree.  A Discord consolidator is needed - a sort of tweet deck but for Discord. Anyone know of one?
50,RT @maxgbae: @vagobond Wow! There should be a better solution!
51,"I asked myself - can I reduce the # of discords I interact with daily to just 10. It seemed possible and then the answer came back very clearly ""No, you cannot - try 100 and maybe ..."""

58,"@beaniemaxi @HonestTrad3r I like your modeling here. In fact, unpopular opinion, but I've always liked your vision of how NFT projects should make money."
59,"@beaniemaxi As I read this, I can't help but wonder how involved you were in the early Pixel Vault modeling - my guess is heavily involved. I also can't help wondering if the uncomfortable conversations started around the time of the planet drops...which makes sense to me."
