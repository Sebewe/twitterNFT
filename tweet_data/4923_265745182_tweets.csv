20,@Conanbatt @Suhail Where did I support violence? I’m from* Eastern Europe. Pick up on cues (maybe a glance at my Twitter if you saw I’m “so anonymous”)
21,@Conanbatt @Suhail You are gaslighting this conversation.
22,@Conanbatt @Suhail Uhhhhh. This escalated quickly and you work for a company that is in nyc.
23,@Conanbatt @Suhail This isn’t retaliation. I see the cyber security aspect. “Terrorism” though? 🤨

25,"@Conanbatt @Suhail This isn’t an “act of war”. The true act of war is sending your men in to take over land and lives. That’s the main focus. If you can’t see that, you shouldn’t be working where you’re working, esp since they support Ukrainian artists."

H8ers gonna h8"
33,@GWLVO1 @TruegoldHobo @_UpGreyed @unusual_whales That sounds more like it.
34,@mmarlaire1 @GeminiMen0605 @EagleOfDeath15 @unusual_whales I think it’s 50% of RU supports Putin. Best way is through the pocket.
