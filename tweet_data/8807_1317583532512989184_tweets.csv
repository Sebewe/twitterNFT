9,"@JPEGgm @sartoshi_nft mfers came together around a similar vibe. Early on I saw inclusive, empathic, and super creative mfers everywhere. It was a no brainer for me. Mfers are about community and creativity. That's why we love the derivatives. Deep down we're all mfers"

40,"@0xAllen_ @CryptoDonAlt 💯. It'd feel much better paying taxes if we actually took care of our citizens. There's so much money out here, it's just being hoarded. If we've learned anything from crypto it's that money has no inherent rules. The current system is designed to keep people down"

45,@TMCramer17 @ArtHouseGarbage @HodlrCollective I'll take a look at those Bears Deluxe🤝
46,@TMCramer17 @ArtHouseGarbage @HodlrCollective Yeah I get you. Makes sense. POW might not be worth much until the game comes out so maybe a lower/stable floor for now. But a low floor allows people to get in while the team continues to build and weed out some paper hands. Healthy
47,"@kevimlee @tw1tte7 Beanie was the majority investor in PixelVault. He supplied basically all the liquidity they needed to get started. But he wasn't involved in the creation of Punks Comics story, art, or any business decisions made by PV. Beanie was a clown fr but Gfunk and the core team are legit"
48,@richardchiu 100% mfer
49,@TMCramer17 @ArtHouseGarbage @HodlrCollective I get your point. But either way you look at it a utility token earned via staking is passive income. Still I think you'd find that most of us staking metahero's are stacking POW. Not selling
