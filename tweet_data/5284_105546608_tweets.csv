10,@iamjudasjudas @decentraland haha yes i do agree. well even if it did say it was not a democracy they are still calling itself decentraland which  the irony on that keeps getting funnier and funnier as time goes on. yes i also agree DOA fees it charges creators and land owners aside decentrland is great game
11,@PanduhKingTV @decentraland lol bro anyone that puts in a VP voting system in where one person with 8M VP can have it all in one or several wallets can just vote yes on any grant knew what they were doing from beginning. mods will just result into pay offs we all know that lol
12,@WildfiresPrjkt I till people now I rather give hundreds of Waifumon away via comments on twitter using @MrDrHamm bot rather then gifting someone 1 @Waifumons now using broken sea. they doing it on purpose. i don't know why cryptopunks were once free give aways too no joke.

15,"LOL If they told us if we buy 8M @decentraland $MANA for $800,000 in 2021 then in 2022 you would be able to pass random $240,000 grants to yourself through the next couple years later on. It would have prob mooned a lot faster no Zuckpocolips required https://t.co/GMEdmylGIt"
