4,@beaniemaxi @ben_s_cooper Aren’t you a web3 influencer? Have you not taken advantage of the unsophisticated masses more than once? If you feel you have such a greater understanding than everyone else shouldn’t you use your following to educate not condescend?

Check it out if you can find the time. It was my first introduction to a project with tokenomics and p2e. They made it easier to understand with “how to”videos plus the team is always active in discord."

11,@Gee__Gazza This is the way
12,@AstonDreamz @BobbyBananasNFT Extremely fair point of view. Hope all apes win in the end 🤝
13,@AstonDreamz @BobbyBananasNFT I agree with some of this. Mainly entitlement to SOME early folks. However i will say the solid long time club members are a much louder voice and have provided nothing but value to me. Just my point of view.
14,@Loopifyyy Agreed although if you’re up over 50% on a position you never intended on holding for over a year makes sense to take some chips off the table in my opinion. Plus if things point to crazy bounce back you have the position to jump back in accordingly.
15,@KeyboardMonkey3 @KenobiDesigns @NateAlexNFT @Pacoiin Just took some 100% CoC return chips off the table. Not sure why i feel like i lost. Hoping small multi family inventory grows so i can grab 1-2 more this year. Been a pleasure following you gentlemen from a far. Let’s see what happens next.
16,@NateAlexNFT @KeyboardMonkey3 @Pacoiin Yeah i think so many people are sitting thinking “the next leg up I’ll take profits” sadly value will be crushed so hard “the next leg up” won’t even get most back to even.
17,@wagmi__eth Wait a week they’ll all be under .2
18,@KeyboardMonkey3 @Pacoiin @NateAlexNFT Question i find myself asking is will it ever come back? So many people are already holding losses. Is it a local top or is everyone who came into this space at the end of last year absolutely fucked right now?

35,@kingg__nickk @Deadfellaz of course however i think it would be far more beneficial to checkout the news tabs of the website. If you like what the team has built/is building then check out the discord where myself and the rest of the community could help answer any questions you may have. Is that fair?

45,@T_Kap What does the Pepsi mic drop NFT do? Just a collectible? Why did you base the collection around microphones and have the official @pepsi account and snoop dog tweet about it during the super bowl if it has nothing to do with that event? What are you doing with the $ made so far?
