70,"If you are not managing your assets in a decentralized blockchain, it means that 3rd party custodians are managing them for you.

Time to learn or get washed out of your savings."
71,"$BTC is trustless, this means that you don’t have to trust anyone with your bitcoin because only you are responsible for it. No one can prevent you from receiving or sending transactions."
72,"In just a few days over $1 million were transferred to a bitcoin wallet that belongs to the organizers of the Convoy. 

No one can seize those funds. Bitcoin is permissionless, this means that you don’t need anyone’s permission in order to effect a transaction."
73,"A big portion of millennials don’t trust the banks nor the government and for good reason. In generation Z, the majority of them don’t trust these entities.

This is why crypto is the fastest adopted technology."
74,"This means that if your money is in the bank and you’re part of the convoy you will not be able to use your dollars. This is because you don’t actually own your money, the bank does."
75,"The government of Canada has also invoked the emergencies act. 

The government has declared that it will seize any corporate or personal bank account of any convoy goer. The government has also decided to suspend insurance to the vehicles participating in the convoy."
76,"Over $10 million were raised in just over two weeks in support of the freedom convoy in Canada. The funds were raised through a platform called Go Fund Me. 

Through government intervention the platform has frozen the donations and will not be distributing them to the cause."
