In Web3/NFTs you can hustle your way into a meeting with just about anyone &amp; the most scarce resources are strong, knowledgeable talent in a nascent technology."
29,"@LoganOP_gm Id argue that there are skillsets that translate over to Web3/NFTs, but a degree isnt as valued here as experience- youll probs learn more hustling into &amp; working w/ a strong team than in years of college.

My TLDR; it entirely depends on the industry. Web3/NFTs isnt one of them."

- DMCA notice
- Online Service Provider removes content
- Notify user
- User provides counter-notice
- OSP restores access or initiate court action"
47,"The market doesn’t properly value or reward the front-loading of these expenses so most projects don’t bother. As the space matures, buyers should be asking better questions and founders expecting higher levels of scrutiny (general retail doing better research)"
48,"As buyers become more reluctant to blindly throw their crypto at random projects &amp; unproven teams, I believe there will be an opportunity in providing further transparency &amp; additional assurances (disclosures, 3rd party contract audits, security consulting, locked liquidity, etc)"

58,"@iwwon_official I’m not OS’s attorney, but Safe Harbor only extends so far. If they give preferential/special treatment to certain collections regarding copyright claims, that’s on them, but it shouldn’t come as a surprise they’re following standard DMCA notice-and-takedown procedure"
59,"Legacy, archaic systems &amp; laws may not fit the ethos of Web3/NFTs. This comes with trade offs for protections/recourse in the space.
Social consensus is powerful. 
Vote with your ETH."
60,@farokh I agree that the law and process is frustrating. I'm not in any way trying to defend the pursuant party or OS in particular. Its an archaic process being applied to new tech that arguably doesn't fit it
61,@0x_christopher @farokh @CryptoMories @opensea Your proposed solution is to not comply and be held liable for damages in court (which can also include the pursuant’s legal fees)?
62,@farokh @economist @CryptoMories @opensea Not really. When it comes to the law and potential infringement thats for the courts to decide. The procedure ties OS (or any other platform/publisher)’s hands in removing the claimed infringing material until details are provided to the claimed IP owner to pursue them in court.
63,@0x_christopher @farokh @CryptoMories @opensea This is not accurate. The only “OR” here is that they do not act and are potentially liable for damages for providing platform and market to the claimed infringing material.
64,"@farokh @CryptoMories @opensea That has little do do with DMCA other than potential attempted extortion of money and a game of legal chicken- who will call the bluff or give up first? 
Copyright trolling is an issue across many industries. OS is simply following the law in their jurisdiction here."

66,"@farokh @CryptoMories @opensea This isn’t an OS issue, it is a legal issue. This isn’t just a company policy, it’s the law. If CryptoMories follow proper procedure in submitting counter-notice (which it sounds like they are), they’ll be eligible for relisting unless a claim is filed in court.

Not knowing any of the details- if Mories follow proper procedure they should be eligible to counter-notice and *could* be relisted unless the initiator sues them in court"
88,@emereintinge @CryptoMories @opensea None unfortunately… lol but I think this highlights that the space still has strong reliance on Web2 companies + tools that often have to comply to jurisdictional laws and regulations. It’s a tightrope act over a regulatory minefield
89,"@emereintinge @CryptoMories First of all, by law they *have to* respond quickly. Secondly, there was no “major hack”- it was an isolated phishing scam and misinformation that caused many to irrationally panic"
