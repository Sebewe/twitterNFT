1,@the_dome_news @jason_argo2 @ExpansionPunks Me 😁
2,How it feels using tradfi apps and crypto apps simultaneously. https://t.co/AFjmcfIhRC
3,After a brief intermission I'm back with the Solidity posts. The quote tweet is so right! Marking a reference type variable in a function as calldata will lead to cheaper execution cost (the downside being you can't mutate it). In this example it saves you 44647 wei! https://t.co/iuAhPGVe8b https://t.co/y7ukSZSplm
4,@ShannonLeePerr1 @Rainmaker1973 @elonmusk @SpaceX Very cool idea!

7,"On day #22 of #dailyblockchaindevconcept: The order in which you declare your ints/uints can affect the cost of deploying a contract! Account #1 was used to deploy the unoptimized version, account #2 deployed the optimized one. Both accounts started with a 100 eth balance. https://t.co/Smw0EPcoOz"
8,@TWiStartups @friedberg Now this is creativity. Love it!
9,God created Arrakis to train the faithful.
10,"On day #21 of #dailyblockchaindevconcept I present: Marking variables as constant can make the contract cheaper to deploy. (See 2nd image. 1st account deployed the unoptimized version, 2nd account deployed the optimized version, both accounts started with 100 eth balance) https://t.co/Zv9RYwvT9w"

22,In previous tweets of my #dailyblockchaindevconcept series I've shared examples of how to accept ether into a contract. This time I'll show you how you can move it from the contract to an address: https://t.co/LfVPZPomvS
23,Something that surprised me about Solidity is that there's no direct way to perform a string comparison. On day #14 of #dailyblockchaindevconcept I present to you one way to perform a string comparison in Solidity: https://t.co/YXhxucmaKH
24,If anyone has any suggestion on how to best share snippets of code on twitter I'd welcome them as well. Been thinking of actually putting a link to a web-based Solidity IDE with the code so that people can actually play with it and not just look at an image.
25,Retweeted as it was brought to my attention that my images were getting cropped 😅. This one is cropped on the preview but you can click on it to look at the whole image.
