53,"@VincentZahler @wytelilly @BellaRisttaa @nathaliejacoby1 I understand you didn't watch the trial; you already rejected the objective fact that the neo-nazi judge illegally threw out relevant evidence.

Like accidentally killing a dog that happens to be rabid."
58,"@VincentZahler @mn_me @wytelilly @BellaRisttaa @nathaliejacoby1 It belonged there less than most.  It was too young to be out past curfew and it broke interstate trade laws by bringing an illegally obtained gun over state lines to murder local residents for political purposes.

61,"@VincentZahler @GaredHunt @wytelilly @BellaRisttaa @nathaliejacoby1 Someone yelled ""active shooter"" and they all ran away from the terrorist.  The terrorist then ran TOWARD the peaceful protesters with it's muzzle pointed at them.
