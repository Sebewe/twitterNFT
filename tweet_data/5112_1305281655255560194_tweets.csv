71,The current definition for blue chip NFTs is quite flawed for the most part as the sector is not mature enough and we don’t have enough data points to really make such bold proclamations yet.
72,"As an unrelated tangent, buy side liquidity will also offer insight into what projects are really blue chip, a topic that has been somewhat controversial the past few months. Deeper liquidity would act as a signal for as a more stable SOV asset."
73,I imagine at first these pools will have to be incentivized by some farming mechanism to attract initial liquidity as fees alone will not be worth the risk for LPers.
74,"It’s important for the ecosystem for sudov2 or nftx or some other protocol offer an AMM for NFTs with single sided buy liquidity (ie, depositing ETH to buy at some prearranged pricing curve model)"
75,"using NFTs as collateral for borrowing is going to be a game changer in 2022. However, in order to do this, you need deep liquidity pools so that the loans can be liquidated on the buy side with narrow bid/ask spreads and little slippage to protect the lender."
