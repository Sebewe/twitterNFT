0,@Loopifyyy @zachxbt I would also pay for the other side of this as a founder/project team to have you review elements of a project before launch.
1,@RyanBerckmans You're advocating against a lot of the exact reasons Web3 and crypto were created. 🤡
2,@NicoleBehnam All those things you listed are market and industry related at least. Thirst trap photos are not.
3,@0x_Capital Stealth compensating popular NFT handles and waiting for them to psyops everyone on CT.
4,@AutismCapital Ultimately no because Putin does whatever he wants. Trump would have done a lot of more talking and shitposting but Putin knows we are not going to war with him.

12,"@RaoulGMI Everyone is just telling you random stuff to buy. You don't need to mint. You can wait, observe and engage with most all communities without buying the NFT. There's far less hoping and wondering at that point. This goes for projects and individual creators."
13,"@cobie When you're measuring off $70M, $20K is small tbf"
14,What a pleasant surprise to see the Pixelmon and Invisible Friends collab 😂

17,@ethereum_dapps @DeezeFi So basically he's a real life G'EVOL.

20,@cryptoein You think people are waiting for Coinbase to add an NFT platform to spend $10K+ on NFTs?! https://t.co/Wv350bvOmQ
21,@gajeshnaik @Coinbase_NFT Solana uptime is highly problematic. Infrastructure requirements are also highly prohibitive.
22,@Coinbase_NFT The answer here is Polygon. Solana can't even stay up long enough to build trust and Tezos doesn't have enough DeFi activity to build economic purpose.
23,"@0xTycoon I don't think it is an either or as everyone is assuming. He could use crypto to ""back"" his fiat currency. What then? There are a lot of ways to play this."
24,@DubsChecksem What have they been doing for the last two years?
25,@niyomoto Oh I'm very aware why. This is where you adapt and idk do your job and be creative.
26,"Eric Adams, new NYC mayor, thinks putting on a suit and going into the office is more productive than remote work in your pajamas. Anyone who has WFH knows you're more comfortable and work more remotely.

27,"Russia has a lot of very cheap oil, meaning a lot of cheap energy, meaning cheap PoW operations, meaning this could be bad for Bitcoin."
28,"Physical Gold = Useless as money

29,@CryptoDonAlt The only thing driving gold as money is mythology and dogma.

31,"@Chubbs_McC @naval Blinded by laser eyes, common problem in crypto."
32,RT @naval: Crypto is the smartest people in the world exiting into their own economy.
33,@kayhanley They can't? People in El Salvador can. You telling me El Salvador has some sort of capability that Russia doesn't?
34,@nnimrodd I hope not.
35,@kayhanley Use it as intended.

42,"@trilldeceased Putin cited ""denazification"" as a reason already."
43,Translation: Actually doing anything will have real impacts to global markets and operations. Ukraine you're on your own. https://t.co/LebmY6nOUQ
44,@DeezeFi Deeze with savage truths. Love it. 🤣
45,"@iamDCinvestor I don't think it actually plays out this way. I'm watching dominance. If BTC doesn't pickup significant dominance gains, I believe it is a sign of a major shift during a bear."
46,@FUCKINGRUG @candevsdosmtng @LensProtocol Oh you know about Lens? Cool.
47,@candevsdosmtng @LensProtocol is giving everyone the foundation to do that. Literally the last thing we want is some company at the center of that

52,@peterszilagyi01 ETH narrative doesn't claim to be a store of value or safe haven... What are you getting at?
53,@NonFungibleNoah @farokh https://t.co/DBvvXsFPcZ
54,Bitcoin consistently proves that it isn't a store of value or safe haven during the times Bitcoiners claim it would be.
55,@balajis Proof of work is not essential. It has done its job as a conceptual catalyst for crypto.
56,@Ahsahno @Breaking911 Imagine thinking this is like sports teams.

58,"RT @ParikPatelCFA: If you’re down 90% on a stock don’t worry, it can still drop 100%"
59,@Arthur_0x You can't blame people for not forgetting all the times we were lied to before.
60,@WatcherGuru I was told Bitcoin would have fixed this.
61,@pmarca Definitely not on Twitter.
62,@AWice When the sentiment strongly changes or go into alternative investments.
63,@icebergy_ Never was. Just like NATO was only supposed to exist for USSR. Yet here we are. Maybe he's trying to make NATO make sense.

66,@Blockworks_ BREAKING: Auction for 104 Punks should have never been offered.
67,Solidified and elevated 🥴 https://t.co/Chq0jc1n8V
68,@cobie @DeezeFi https://t.co/S2qACzjZlL
69,@cobie What we're seeing is another example of auction houses not providing enough value over other much cheaper options.
70,@cobie Rugged! Best explanation so far.
71,@not_buns Then why post an auction lol
72,I'm guessing no real buyers for 104 punks. Isn't that Sotheby's and Christie's main responsibility? Bringing buyers to the table for an auction they chose to present?
73,"@farokh Take the floor, multiply by 100, add hammer fee. Auctions here don't make much sense."
74,@newethguy The one thing you learn in this space is to not assert firsts.
75,@0xBender Let the market buy what it wants. If the number is too much then other collectors will react. Anything else is subjective and arbitrary based on individual bias.
76,@FUCKINGRUG https://t.co/WtBTB2NXbF
77,Someone is going to make a derivative called Invisible Invisibles. Just blank boxes. Will probably mint out. 😂
78,@FarmingSats No clue. Wasn't part of it.
79,@nftstrategies Still won't work. They're literally not fit for profile due to layout.
80,"Invisible Friends are cool, I like them. Not a pfp at all though. You're cutting off like 65% of the visual trying to do flex them as such. That utility needs to be easy and obvious. https://t.co/vxjR3KuzED"

83,"@Blockworks_ None of these companies are really ""metaverse""."

88,@songadaymann The hilarious part is that rarity is subjective af. People act like there's some defacto standard for determining rarity. There is not. It is all based on statistical models and assumptions.
89,@CoinDesk @jpmorgan @cmoyall @IanAllison123 JPMorgan and blockchain is like fox and hen house.
90,"@0xZuwu Meh.

""Every Twetch post is archived and stored on the BSV blockchain. With BSV we are able to create transactions and transfer data for fractions of a penny.""

Would be better to watch the build out based on @LensProtocol. At least Polygon is EVM compatible, Ethereum ecosystem"
91,@farokh None of this is new.
