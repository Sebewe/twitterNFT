7,@ShrewdCharlie No the yield ($gang/ETH) will likely be highest for a floor pigeon/rat.  That’s part of why I buy and trade for so many 😂
8,@jimi_ethers I doubt GCG simped for anyone.  Maybe it was just not a ton of effort for us so I didn’t matter that Puma just did all of the cats lol
9,@_618er @HouseofKibaa Lmao not at all
10,"Corporations should pursue fewer and more authentic partnerships in NFTs, or stay out.  I say this whenever a senior leader asks and it’s in my deck for BOD/C-suite presentations. https://t.co/jZgbAs4uAE"
11,"Well, good thing I didn’t buy those @PUMA Melos yet.  If I’d known they were “partnering” with half the phone book I probably wouldn’t have been so excited.  Oh well, $gang and 🧬 soon!"

13,@Not_Han_Solo Thank you!
14,"Sleepy Joe faces a 41(-53) approval rating and needs (right?) to send a message to Putin tonight while giving adequate time to pocketbook issues admist scary CPI inflation.  Oh, and COVID is still something we care about.  Should be a fun one! https://t.co/WSUrHxq50B"

46,@MinnesotaHaze @BoomBoomNFT Nice PFP!
47,@OGDfarmer Yeah I don’t think anyone is being tricked into paying 7 ETH for one.  Definitely a let it happen but let my friends know if they ask that they shouldn’t be influencer exit liquidity for one
48,@tmagled @doodles You might but probably it’ll just be a bunch of squishiness and whining
49,@Bonecondor 100% Ken has SWATted a teen before
50,@tmagled @doodles Bad product design and owner negligence aren’t your fault.  I’m sure there will be people refreshing that page all day hoping for a snipe

52,@NFTsins @GutterCatGang Though if the GCG marketed a new species and it was just an animation I would drive down to Florida and slap @gutterdan_ .  Fortunately I know they’d never do that
53,@NFTsins @GutterCatGang Yes
54,@NFTsins I definitely do not keep regular tabs on everything I have 13+ ETH of

56,@DanVerno 🤝
57,@winap …then he shouldn’t have waited to make his initial offer.  Or if he’s managing to ETH/USD (which is really fucking dumb in most cases) he shouldn’t beg me to trade with him 🤷‍♂️

61,@TheAlienBoyNFT @MaisonDeGOAT @EverydayJohn_ 👀
62,@TheAlienBoyNFT @boredspaceape Alien Boy is just low-effort E.T.
63,@LoganOP_gm @CircaDiem I’m sure the animations took a long time!  I’m not saying it’s bad art at all
64,@Stoniphantom @gutterdan_ @gutterric @GutterMitch @gutterikarlee @GutterCatGang Fuck it $gang today?
65,@LoganOP_gm @CircaDiem No idea as I don’t follow them closely.  But it seems to be their big thing for their first quarter year in operations so if it’s just a prop 🤷‍♂️
66,@CircaDiem I’m being sarcastic but sure
67,"@TheScreamingMen You can’t sell Space Doodles without selling the attached Doodles so financially-motivated people can’t do what they frequently do, sell the airdrop for liquidity"
68,I will say that a completely illiquid companion NFT is a really good way to figure out who’s really in it for the art
69,@itstylersays You definitely would
70,@JayhawkNFT Very nice
71,@TheAlienBoyNFT Can you please link the next collection to OG boys so I can steal a bunch from people who don’t read the fine print?
72,I guess I’m 5 WETH bid on Space Doodles 🤣 🤣
73,@SubvertEth @skominers @amazzara1 @AnthonyLeeZhang Maybe the @TheAlienBoyNFT and @MaisonDeGOAT ?  I can ask the @BoredGutterApes folks but we are a relatively small project until our Gen collection in the spring
74,@SubvertEth @skominers @amazzara1 @AnthonyLeeZhang Wow this is very cool.  I wish I had the time and skill 😂
75,@SmokinLou914 Lmao yeah I called him on that
76,"@JetSetTogether @heckman_eth That’s up to the heck man as the proposal author but I assumed it would be humanitarian.  Either way I’d vote yes or effectively proxy my votes to whatever you, as someone on the ground who I respect, picked"
77,Please go do this @GutterCatGang whether you vote yes or no (I voted yes with 62 effective votes)!  Gutter Gives! https://t.co/IYYNfz3jB4
78,@heckman_eth The only thing though: maybe in the comments put down what organization we’d send the $50k to?  Maybe @JetSetTogether in addition to voting her assets could recommend one?
79,@heckman_eth You’re halfway home.  My bag counts for 62 somehow
80,@skominers @amazzara1 @AnthonyLeeZhang Would be interesting to see one where the clues themselves aren’t token-gated though
81,@SnoopDogg @deathrowmusic @SpottieWiFi buy and rap over this.  No brainer.
82,@CliveApestein @0xApes_NFT Not doing this.  @DegenSoul 👀 in case you want to.

86,@CliveApestein Don’t think this has anything to do with  @0xApes_NFT in general but I guess do what you need to do to feed the narrative?  🤷‍♂️
87,@Drucritt Lmao that’ll teach me to try and crop on my phone before coffee.  Oh well not changing it
88,"@beaniemaxi I mostly agree though I leave room for innovation to pleasantly surprise me.

People expect millisecond response times from dynamic and rich websites.  Can’t really replicate that pulling EVERYTHING on chain, certainly not in a truly decentralized way."
