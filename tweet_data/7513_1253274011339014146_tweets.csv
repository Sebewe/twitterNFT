43,@chopper__dad @fugazi0x @OG_Kenobi_Hello @steveb_crypto @BaGGZz_ @NotLarvaLabs I DM’d you if you care to read
44,"@NathanHeadPhoto 0.03 on my project, it’s fallen under the radar but I have lots of plans for it! @Blastonauts"
45,"@OG_Kenobi_Hello @BaGGZz_ @steveb_crypto @NotLarvaLabs Oh, you are saying that like I didn’t try the things that were suggested to me:/ maybe that’s where you are confused! But yeah nuff said, if I need assistance I will holla 👋🏻"
46,"@OG_Kenobi_Hello @BaGGZz_ @steveb_crypto @NotLarvaLabs Haha I don’t blame him, I also gave up after exhausting all other options"
47,"@OG_Kenobi_Hello @BaGGZz_ @steveb_crypto @NotLarvaLabs @chopper__dad It was in response to me being grateful, the site functions yes, but didn’t for me, therefore I’m clearly not going to be grateful for it. Again I’m not sure why everyone is getting butthurt about this all, I like NLL, but it didn’t work, I solved the issue by using LooksRare"
48,"@OG_Kenobi_Hello @BaGGZz_ @steveb_crypto @NotLarvaLabs @chopper__dad Pos in my grown up world means point of sale, so just say it with your chest next time, but yeah I’ve always respected the Phunks working for free.
Maybe I’ll learn to be grateful when the product I’m using actually functions."
49,"@P0SHBURGER @TreeGuyJON Appreciate this, simple but effective way to put it, this will help me :)"
50,"@fugazi0x @OG_Kenobi_Hello @steveb_crypto @BaGGZz_ @NotLarvaLabs @chopper__dad He asked a fair question that got a response, but then asked the same fair question about 4/5 times, I liked Steve but he is so far up phunks’ there’s no going back + who has time to continually read his CAPS lock bs, I’d rather just sell it on LooksRare and move on with my life"
51,@OG_Kenobi_Hello @steveb_crypto @BaGGZz_ @NotLarvaLabs @chopper__dad It’s like he’s your little hitman to destroy all and any criticism or issues
52,"@OG_Kenobi_Hello @steveb_crypto @BaGGZz_ @NotLarvaLabs @chopper__dad Everyone I spoke to was happy to help, don’t get me wrong Kenobi, I respect the Phunks and the movement but people like Steve really don’t improve the situation at all and it makes me want to retaliate instead of solve the issue"
53,"@TreeGuyJON I’ve been trying to apply this to my daily life to a certain extent, I feel like I punish myself for wasting my own time, but all we are doing is living in this illusion with no real goals or deadlines, just gotta chill and enjoy the journey"
54,"@steveb_crypto @BaGGZz_ @NotLarvaLabs Every suggestion to help fix it was aimed at user error or updating our browser/ mm, like we haven’t exhausted every option available already.

I’m not nearly as invested into phunks as you are, so the next response you give pretend I’m a brick wall cause I ain’t responding."
55,"@steveb_crypto @BaGGZz_ @NotLarvaLabs I personally see a different side and encountered the same issue, if you had the same issue I’m sure you’d let us know too. With a community like yourself I’m glad I sold"
56,"@steveb_crypto @BaGGZz_ @NotLarvaLabs I don’t remember him leaving voice notes of him screaming like a petulant child though
It’s not worth your time or mine Steve, you’re a cool don but you licking phunks’ gooch is a bit far
Just both get on with it separately.
At least my boy Baggzz can actually sell on LooksRare"
57,"@steveb_crypto @BaGGZz_ @NotLarvaLabs Baggzz is my boy I couldn’t care about the situation, he isn’t a clown, I was there at the original thread, tried selling mine as a test and had the same issue so I’m backing my boy, the reaction you are giving from this is clown energy brother, chill out and move on with life"
58,"@steveb_crypto @BaGGZz_ @NotLarvaLabs Yeah they might of been able too, I’m not bothered about it anyway, imma come back and sweep phunks when I’m rich"
59,"@BaGGZz_ @steveb_crypto @NotLarvaLabs I like the phunk movement but imagine grilling someone for highlighting a potential issue instead of helping, even if it is a small select few people who can’t sell, still deserves the attention u know"
60,"@steveb_crypto @BaGGZz_ @NotLarvaLabs I was chatting to some people in the discord, they were trying to be helpful which is all I can ask! No disrespect to Phunks or NLL, the devs are great! But no luck though so Looksrare came clutch for me"
61,"@steveb_crypto @BaGGZz_ @NotLarvaLabs I’m with Baggzz on this one, I tried to sell too but NLL wouldn’t let me, I tried on iPhone, PC (3 different browsers), not saying it’s Phunks fault, but the site isn’t perfect, the only benefit is 0% fees, I had to sell mine on LooksRare too"
