51,Imagine someone you love dies. Your family will give you room to grieve. They'll support you. They'll share your pain in hopes of diminishing it. Your employer might give you a couple of days off for bereavement leave. Extra time off *you need to grieve* will be unpaid. (7/x)

85,@SashtheSoulsmit @SocialistFT If you think it’s amusing to call the French cowards after they were obliterated by the Nazis and half a million French people died then that says more about you than them. 🤷🏻
