7,The holders of $ANC know what they're doing.  LP pool is getting smaller and single staking pool getting larger in the past several hours.  less liquidity means higher volatility.  combined with $ANC proposals...🚀
8,@WestieCapital 100% with you here.  $ANC potential has only started to get priced in.
9,@danku_r @TaikiMaeda2 @anchor_protocol @jdorman81 @LFG_org @retrogrademoney thanks for the interview.  I didn't catch it live but the way people are talking in how we can reward ANC holders with it's massive TVL is making me very bullish.

44,"For those looking to buy the dip, consider another solution.  ETH-USDC LP.  you earn fees on swaps and can effectively DCA into ETH if the price goes any lower.  If ETH goes up, well at least you have some ETH instead of waiting for the perfect buy."
