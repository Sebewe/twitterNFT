36,@cryptoclawd22 Its an entry to the BAYC community for the rest of the world that doesnt have 60eth to spend. Super bullish on $APE
37,@cryptoclawd22 I agree it rarely happens. But i honestly think the BAYC team will over deliver on the quality of this token
38,@cryptoclawd22 This only applies if the news fails to achieve the hype of the rumor
39,#BAYC will push 100eth after $APE releases
