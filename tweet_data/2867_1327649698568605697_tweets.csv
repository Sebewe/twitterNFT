1,Had the chance to collab with Korn last year and it was amazing. I would really love to keep working side by side with bands/artist that I love and respect. What do you think @septicfleshband? Let's crush it 🤘
2,How do you guys have so much time for Discord? I check it once a month lol.

50,@magusz_art Totally agree!
51,"@RIGHTCLCKSAVEAS Totally, I believe there is still a lot for us in this space."
52,Some artists have gone silent since it became harder to sell NFT art. So are we artists or are we sellers?
