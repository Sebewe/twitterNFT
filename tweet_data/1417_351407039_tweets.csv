9,"@edwllcxn @metalinklabs Maybe more like a video put together by bits of the community to showcase the art, the talent, the beneficial impact made, all by the NFTs that dropped in each year. Imagine Youtube Rewind but not ass"
10,I think we need to start a yearly NFT rewind. The culture needs to be documented on more than just the blockchain.
11,@latteicecoffee I feel that. Had to use good ol WETH to get my clone 😂
12,"@HODLCEO You’re definitely right, both have a few hurdles. Im sure in the future there will he very little stopping animated PFPs from existing though. Hopeful lol"
13,@latteicecoffee This was back when they first revealed. Saw potential in a “floor” azuki and swooped. Hoping you secure something amazing for a good price 🥂🌟
14,@latteicecoffee Secured my grail for 3 ETH. 1/1 Sniper 🎯 https://t.co/wpjZoNloVP
15,@HODLCEO If you have Twitter Blue + Animated NFT selected you can see it animated if you press it.  Also discord supports animated pfps too. My point is the top 2 places for have an animated pfp kinda support it already.
16,Are animated PFPs the next move?

40,@rhino_smoking @MaisonDeGOAT @BPSnow11 Agreed
41,@MaisonDeGOAT Great example of what you can expect from the @MaisonDeGOAT family 🥂 @BPSnow11 has always been a GOAT ✨
42,What will stop groups like Topps and Pokemon Company from incorporating NFT Code cards of sorts so that the rare pulls you get can be authenticated and sold alongside the card itself? Just a fun thing to think about.

58,"@Alts_Anonymous @RTFKTstudios Clone x is an example of a project that has so much to offer that people are hesitant to buy in until they’ve seem a glimpse because it seems “too good to be true”. Im calling it now, beginning of march we hit 20 ETH and the MNLTH will be something wild worth 6+"
