15,@ChefZbo @CryptoCannaClub Oh I already know 🙌🏼
16,"If @opensea was transparent with why some collections are verified and why some collections are not verified there would probably be a lot less complaints from the community 

We really don’t know anything that goes on there that’s why people question them

Why don’t they just go to war in the metaverse 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

It would save time, be much more cost efficient, and not to mention save thousands of lives that will be lost

38,"Wondering what the @InvsbleFriends floor is going to look like pre-reveal 

With a .25 mint price you have to expect to see insane floor prices pre-reveal and then see it gradually drop off post-reveal 

Very curious to see how this one plays out 🤔

61,@JeanPTomas Yea it really depends on the project. I think .02-.08 is fair even when eth was at 4k. A lot of the most successful projects have minted below .04 like alien frens
62,"@JeanPTomas Look at the mint prices of all the projects that are overhyped on twitter. I almost guarantee they are over .1, bored bunny minted for .4 not long ago"

I hope you are all safe out there my friends ❤️ 

Be sure to take all precautions when protecting your assets. Start with getting a hardware wallet 🍻

Make sure you are taking precautions- revoke permissions 

Hoping it is a phishing scam rather than a @opensea exploit so that their are limited individuals effected
