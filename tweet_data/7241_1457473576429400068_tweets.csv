17,"@niyomoto The airdrop itself isn't bullish and full of risk to holders bags (short term) but I think once its done it triggers a whole new wave of buyers..

Its only a matter time."
18,@_Smyly Unconfirmed as far as I know but I think it was initially stated as last week of Feb
19,"@Digital_A55et_ I don't disagree and if it does drop its only a matter of time before it flips ATH again.

Its almost innevitable at this point"

Now everyone's questioning why Mfers is worth 5Eth

I still don't get it or own but i understand the value now

Does that make sense?.. probably not

are they worth it?.. Most definitely

NFT's are strange"
