49,"I'm surprised more projects don't do public mint followed by whitelist mint. Look, if your mint price is 0.1 and the project floor is 0.5, bots have financial incentive to scheme. I thought it worked extremely well for @AzukiZen mint to have their DA before public."

79,"@GenXGypsyNFT @StudioIrida @WomenTribe_nfts It's a nice reality check for you, as harsh as it sounds. All of Ethereum is open source, people that put in the time are able to mint directly from the Blockchain contract or build their own bots to do so for them."
