10,@brownrygg On it 😎
11,"@ABigThingBadly @AYYYliens_nft @SGB6637 LOL it’s not, which is why your tweet came as a surprise. I guess it was more about how much energy is spent on this than anything else."
12,"@ABigThingBadly @AYYYliens_nft @SGB6637 Personally I prefer to spend my time &amp; energy elsewhere, but at least we agree it’s not ok"
13,"@ABigThingBadly @AYYYliens_nft @SGB6637 Just check out his mob tweet and some of his replies. It’s not a 6 years old thing, he’s clearly still holding those views."
14,@ABigThingBadly @AYYYliens_nft @SGB6637 Check his recent tweets. Also if he had apologized I’m sure people would react differently but he choose to double down so 🤷‍♀️
15,"@0k_zh Think of the internet in mid 90s. It’s all super early and exciting. Lots of craziness. Way too much hype. Unclear what will hold. 99.9% won’t. But, it’s (probably) part of the journey to (way) more interesting and “sustainable” use cases."

43,"@divine_economy I wasn't joking, I don't see them at all as web3. Do you see coinbase as web3? For me it needs to be more than just ""doing anything on top of a blockchain"" to be meaningful and differentiated enough"

49,"I also think it's fair (and important) to add that Gary has added A LOT of positive influence to NFTs and crypto in general, and it benefits greatly all of us that he keeps doing that"
50,"The (sad) reality is that most people in this space are looking for quick cash grabs. Simple as that. And it's not just newcomers, but it's some (most?) of those influencers as well. As long as we keep promoting these projects, we're going to keep fueling that mentality."
51,"For ""utility NFTs"" - how about we focus on the utility?

If people want to develop a game based on NFT, how about you develop the game first, or god forbid a super early version, before you promote/sell ANYTHING?"
52,"While I respect @0x_fxnction for ""calling @garyvee  out"", and it sounds like that ""awareness boost"" might've actually been helpful - how about we discuss how to change that narrative? How we set higher standards for new projects?"
53,"This is a very thoughtful &amp; intelligent dialogue (which is quite rare in this space) between 2 well-meaning individuals.

More than anything, I believe it exposes the deeper problems in the space, and we should be focused on tackling those. https://t.co/zfdY86Ne6c"
54,"@rationalaussie That's helpful, but I think we have to pull away some stuff from Discord, rather than work around it. We're using it for many use cases it just isn't suited for 🤷‍♀️"
55,"@chaserchapman That's a fair point, maybe you can normalize the tokens for contributors so it'll be same/similar?

For non contributors I wonder if it makes sense. I do like the idea of decaying power, helps to keep people engaged."
56,"@chaserchapman Curious how that happens..is that because early contributors are getting more tokens for the same work? Or just because some people have contributed for a while they'll always be ""ahead"" if they keep contributing?"
57,@NathanHeadPhoto How about Winter NFT NYC before?
58,@iamDCinvestor Good thing everything recorded forever on the blockchain 😏
59,"If you're building a community on discord, but don't share anything internal before it's public everywhere else - what's the point?"
60,@beaniemaxi What about their approach to the community? I'd put that as their biggest issue and the one least likely to change (in a significant way)
61,"@chaserchapman How about votes are weighted by how many tokens you earned through contributions rather than how many token you hold right now?

It does make sense to have some requirement to vote (skin in the game), maybe you only need to hold 10% to vote?"

67,"@davemclain @elawless This is not binary or mutually exclusive, it's important to protect people (or maybe more importantly - punish fraudulent activity), but it doesn't mean we should make it impossible for people to earn ownership in companies."
68,@BrantlyMillegan @ethleaderboard 👋
69,@Clavisishere What is a masters degree in web3? 🤔
70,"@sariazout @joaxap It probably needs to be a combination. I imagine fully remote companies are experiencing similar challenges, I wonder how they handle it. I believe as the network grows, there needs to be some structure to keep people's sanity &amp; ""closeness"" feeling. Discord lacks that (big time)."
71,"@jacksquaredson @theaceofthespad @JrRmack I'm not sure there is, we're still super early and it's on us to prove these hypotheses and models actually work. If it will, pretty sure we won't need to do much explaining..."

74,"OpenSea raised $300m at $13.3B 😱

Amazing to see how all the creators, artists and customers are sharing their success!

While I'm happy for them, I hope people are going to start differentiating between web2 + blockchain to web3"
75,@beaniemaxi You can play poker in the casino 😉
76,@iamDCinvestor @cryptoadzNFT People are not going to lose interest if it becomes stagnant?
77,"@iamDCinvestor I guess it's just human psychology, so we're seeing similar trends just different tools.

On the bright side - at least more and more people are starting to see it (some people pushed back on this narrative)"
78,"@honam @bchesky @levie But it wasn't just guys trying to make a quick buck, right? They might be the vast majority, but there were others who focused on substance. With all the hype (and noise), unfortunately it's sometimes quite easy to miss that."

80,"@fintechjunkie It's very encouraging to follow your learning, and really impossible to turn away once ""you're in"".

I believe the industry is going to push towards more transparency (for me that's part of the ""decentralization""), and the companies who don't will simply stay behind."
81,Amazingly well put https://t.co/veIWkw6aX7
82,"@karanortman You're asking great questions that keep many of us busy as well, definitely not over thinking it 😊

With all that hype sometimes it's quite easy to forget we're SUPER EARLY and so much is still missing to make crypto really ""mainstream""."
83,@chriscantino For me it's more people looking to speculate than to actually build.
84,"@cdixon @narfizzle There is definitely some level of ""I don't get what's wrong with web2"" vibe in all that criticism (which some of it is justified)"
