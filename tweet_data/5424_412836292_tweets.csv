5,@GMgirlsNFT @jolenecasko @90sbabesnft Oh totally. I wore their stuff for the first time when I was 11. Lots of Paul Frank t-shirts and ironic graphic tops because that’s what an 11 year old would pick out.
6,@MC_Fitzpatrick Oh it’s so fucking bad. Have had to turn down lots of “let me pick your brain” aka let’s take your ideas for free and use them to build million dollar ideas. Hence the creation of this thread. We need to call out the bad behavior and shut it down now.

47,"13/ Finally we are in such a good spot to fix garbage behavior and business practices from web2, let's not fuck it up."
48,"12/ I will say it again because it's the most important: do right by others, make sure they are being paid fairly, compensated for their time, get credit for their ideas and they will continue to love this space and innovate."
49,11/We don't get ahead by dissing male projects. We get ahead by building kickass communities and being models of best practices for this industry. @crypto_coven and @meta_angels are two that stand head and shoulders above the rest of doing it right.
50,10/ Collaboration is ripe for the picking. Make sure you're doing it right - compensating and providing as much value possible for each side.
51,"9/ This is the place to genuinely express your enthusiasm about other projects and this space. You don't need to act above that, and try to play it cool. Best example of this @randizuckerberg I have never seen another individual as excited about female-led projects as her."
52,"8/ Publicly support any financial anything that women in this space are doing. Gas people up. Someone was awesome to talk to and had good ideas, publicly plug that. We have to be our own hype crew."
53,"7/ Intersectionality- everyone has their own experience and relationship with gender identity, respect it, and please be inclusive."
54,"6/ Creators...support other female creators. You are not competing, the better a female-led project does, the better your project will do. We're in this together."
55,5/ Womxn actually talk about what you're being paid in #web3 jobs. Make sure it's what the men are getting. If we can't stop wage gap issues now we never will.
56,4/ Stop forgetting that there are mothers in this community who have to work entire families around mint times and panels and everything. Make the times more flexible.
57,"3/ Stop expecting free advice on #web3 from womxn in this community. Find some type of arrangement of payment for their time whether it's through @viamirror @chatforfive tipping on Twitter, sending money to their @ensdomains. DO it."
58,2/ Pay your community mods who are overwhelmingly female a competitive salary that works out to a decent hourly rate!!!
59,1/ PAY YOUR ARTISTS AND CREATORS!!!
