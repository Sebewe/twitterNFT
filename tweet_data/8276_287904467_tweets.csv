I got only 18 wins this weekend"
32,"8) The good thing about all of this is that now NFT drops burn ETH so even if the artist dump ETH on the market, al least he has burnt 🔥 some. #EIP1559 solve this."
33,"7) I'm not saying that the market is crashing because of that, however, for the crypto maket to hold his value, we  need more crypto believers and less artist looking for getting rich quick."
34,"6) We have artist and content creator jumping in the NFT space, collecting ETH by selling their arts and then cashing out by dumping ETH on the market. I have seen this playing out a lot lately."
35,"5)  We have seen lots of new people coming into this NFT space, most of them don't really know or care of what crypto is about. They are here to follow the trend and to make some profit."
36,"4) We are now in another bull market from 2020, but what we are seeing now is the NFT boom.  Many people are entering this market primarily to buy and speculate on NFTs. Now let me explain why this is not as bullish as people think."
37,"3) From 2018 and for about 2 years, we have seen the bear market, where serious companies have had to sell off to meet their expenses while scammers have sold to get away with the money.  The fact is that the price of ETH has collapsed to $80."
38,"2) From the beginning of 2017 until December, we experienced what is known as the ICO boom, where a lot of companies raised millions in ETH and drove the price from $10 to $1400."
39,"1) #NFTs are like ICOs in 2017 except that they are worse...
