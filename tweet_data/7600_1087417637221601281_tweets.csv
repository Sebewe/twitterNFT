33,"@bernatfortet @basementstudio For blogs I have. Not for a whole site. It lacks structure.

Unless it's for something that expects freeform data (like a blog post), it would be a mess. Editors would probably fail at sticking to the expected structure. Do you know what I mean?"
34,"@bernatfortet @basementstudio I mean, in my mind, content modelling and content authoring has to be the same view. Like Notion's editor: you model it while you write.

Then apply some controls to ""lock"" it's structure.

And I agree, image pasting should just work."
35,"@bernatfortet @basementstudio As of now, DatoCMS has been the best. Although Sanity is great for devs, their dashboard is bad.

Contentful also works great (maybe better than Dato), but their pricing is too enterprisey.

For tabs, we extended our existing `blockContent` structure with a new block (see image for pseudocode).
