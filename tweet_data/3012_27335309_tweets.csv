15,@WGMInterfaces I was really looking forward to this but understand the reason why the founders stepped away. It takes people with good intentions to walk away from millions of dollars and do the right thing for their mental health! Maybe just bad timing right now...🙏

26,"I feel bad for anyone who bought @Pixelmon it’s literally so bad I can’t believe it’s true. It’s probably the most overpromised and underdelivered NFT project, so 💩, the team should refund all ETH addresses immediately #pixelmon #rug https://t.co/snf4u573tB"

88,"Maybe I’m being cynical and maybe it truly was a terrible example of an artist copying another persons work and profiting from it. Either way I don’t think it’s the end of @NFTCryptoChicks , I expect new highs again and the community to be stronger than before! /5"
89,The releasing of the statement of the inspiration of art and then removal of the artist today just seems very calculated and almost too clean?! /4
90,What better way to remove any holders who didn’t believe in the project and shake out paper hands to reward people who wanted to enter and for whales to fill their bags? /3
91,"Firstly why today , it seems strange the CMO of @NFTCryptoChicks is also working with @WomenTribe_nfts which was publicly minting today /2"
92,What if this @NFTCryptoChicks fiasco is all part of a calculated game for PR and movement into the next stage of their business structure? 🧵/ 1 #Cryptochicks
