2,"2 of our internal tools signalled that @DippiesNFT  might sell out. Plus, we compared social signal w/ other projects  also about to launch. 

The social engagement signal is getting stronger and stronger ""in waves"". Again, I don't like the project, but the crowd seems to. https://t.co/IkBpq3pAEY"
3,"@piovincenzo_ When in doubt, ask: what is the value generating activity that this service enables? If the answer is unclear and (- especially) if it requires more and more capital for the machine to keep on working, then great chances are it's  a ponzi."
4,"RT @nntaleb: How do you know that Russia is an autocracy and Ukraine a democracy?

Only a democracy would elect a professional comedian as…"
5,https://t.co/VDHoAKQYC7
6,"Our internal tool Onyx, suggests that @DippiesNFT will sell out. Did Onyx ever signal a project that did not sell out? no. 

Personally I am not in love with the project, it's nothing new: we'll see if we are right or not. do you want to access Onyx?👇"

19,Today @InvsbleFriends will drop. Yesterday I pulled a similar chart and asked: is this the quiet before the storm or is the hype depleting? Now believe the storm is coming: you'll see how much chatter on NFT twitter in the upcoming hours there will be around this project  👇 https://t.co/7XNeHwBJg8
20,"Unless you do NFT art, your NFT is a means to an end. So, start with why? why should I be a holder?"
21,Where are the NFT projects that are building with a value first mentality instead of a hype first approach?
22,"@IamFrankyDuks @CastellVonFaber @gparagone Magari, la prostituta mette in gioco la pelle, il politico no. Se la prostituta fa un errore, e.g. assenza di precauzioni, il rischio è il suo. Se il politico fa errori, il rischio è dei suoi costituenti, si ok, potresti non essere rieletto, ma non hai opzionalità negativa."
23,"The culture of ' I stole your NFT with a screenshot' is laughable.
A fake Rolex with quartz technology might tell the time better than some older legit models. Then why people buy Rolex? 

Fakes don't allow you to say that you own a luxury good in the circles that matter."

26,"tmrw @InvsbleFriends ( @RNDMCHARACTERS ) launches. And yet, these are the mentions this project received on twitter (captured 8 hrs prior this tweet, so take it with a grain of salt) 
Now, is this the calm before the storm or is the hype gone? https://t.co/KuLBKm2W5N"
27,@InvsbleFriends 12/  JOIN OUR DISCORD: https://t.co/VyWqK2Zoq4
28,"@InvsbleFriends 11/ But also the opposite can be true if the estimate at hand requires A LOT of specialized knowledge, which is why I report also the estimate of the 'mini-crowd'. So, do you want to contribute? 👇"
29,@InvsbleFriends 10/ we'll see what happens next on Feb 24th we'll know for sure how off we were. One of the ways we could have messed this up: we had only 32 participants to the poll. ...And Science tells us that estimates get more accurate with large crowds.
30,"@InvsbleFriends 9/ This is very far from my personal estimate, standing at 7.3 eth on launch day. Similarly, the estimate of what I consider the best analysts in the community, stands at around 6.7 eth. This can be considered as a 'mini-crowd of experts'."
31,@InvsbleFriends 8/ so for the price point of Invsblefriends. The community at large says 4.9 eth as the avg price on the first trading day.
32,"@InvsbleFriends 7/ Enter: Blockgems, the community based on social signal tools and wisdom of the crowd. We track discord members, tt followers and tt mentions for each target project in the pre-launch phase. then we poll the community knowledge to get a price point."
33,@InvsbleFriends 6/ but what happens when market dynamics are unable to arise because the project is in the pre-launch / 'hype' phase? How can we guess the price of the project 'pre-market'?
34,"@InvsbleFriends 5/ What does this have to do with NFTs? well, the market, even the NFT market, is a form of collective intelligence. Whenever market dynamics take place we can get a sense of the value (i.e. the price) of a project."
35,"@InvsbleFriends 4/ in the popular tv show 'who wants to be a millionaire' the 'experts' (– i.e. the players) got the questions right 65% of the time, whereas the audience (–folks that apparently have nothing better to do that sitting in a TV studio) got it right 91% of the time."
36,@InvsbleFriends 3/ In 1907 Sir Francis Galton asked a crowd to estimate the weight of an ox. the avg of all the individual estimates was just 1 pound away from the actual weight of the animal.
37,@InvsbleFriends 2/ I was always fascinated by the topic of collective intelligence. The idea that seemingly dumb crowds can be smarter than individual 'experts'.
38,"What will be the avg trading price of @InvsbleFriends on the day of launch?

You can provide your estimate below, but if you are interested in what our community has estimated + the how and why, then read on 🧵"

40,"I would have never thought that such a strong community would form around Blockgems. It is an extremely tightly knit group, populated by the smartest traders and researchers. In 3 months, I haven't read one single 'Remember to take breaks and stay hydrated' kind of comment. 👇"
41,GM GM GM! ☕️
42,"I can't believe how fast the NFT space is transforming:

As usual the market is particularly good at filtering out mediocre ideas and suboptimal practices. The pace at which that is happening however, is insane."
43,"People are attracted by the tools we have, the alpha, the intel, the wits of the members composing the group. and I keep on reading 'I can't believe this is free'. So, join us while it's free, we are having a blast: https://t.co/VyWqK2Zoq4"
44,"In the past 3 days I ran an experiment: I wanted to reduce tweeting to the bare minimum, avoid publishing content of any type on any platform to see if people would keep on joining the Blockgems community. The Result? We never had so many joiners. 👇"
45,"Remember, the sentiment is the highest at the peak of the rally, and I am see way too many “NFT worlds is undervalued posts”. If you patience to wait 1 year, present sentiment doesn’t matter, but who has that in the NFT space?"
46,"The project can grow much more in price, but IMO not in the immediate short term. In the long term, it’s a fantastic play, but you’d have to have a 1 year time horizon to enter now. This is contrarian ofc as everyone is bullish @nftworldsNFT  but…"
47,Still own one @nftworldsNFT that I bought at 0.3 eth. I urged everyone to notice how valuable the trade was all the way up to 3.6 ether. At 7 I started to be more risk averse on that one. It’s all in my previous tweets. Reality is…
48,I have been bullish on battlefly since the community was in the low 1000’s. This is a good thread to learn more https://t.co/GHp2AgH6pU

51,8/ It is by all means a contrarian play as you are betting with the pack knowing that you'll have to change strategy at peak sentiment.
52,"7/ In all honesty, often I did buy pre-reveal, but I have also sold most often pre reveal. namely into the hype that leads into showtime. The excitement prior that moment."
53,"6/ The collection owners have all the incentives to hype it up to the max pre reveal, but you know how it is 'buy the rumors sell the news'. This is based on the fact that the true news/reveal hardly ever satisfies expectations."
54,"5/ Also, it is only post reveal that you see if the art had problems, think mekaverse, hapebeast, this stuff was largely disappointing when it came to artistic uniqueness and consistency in quality."
55,"4/ likewise people still buy the pre-reveal token in the hopes they'll get a rare but truth is the odds are against you. Even if people were not overly optimistic as they are, price will still have to drop."
56,"3/ When you bet on red on the Roulette, you have 18 / 38 chances of success (american roulette, 0 and 00) and you get paid 2 to 1. Unfair game. totally irrational, people still play it."
57,"2/ And truth is, people suck at being good intuitive statisticians and in making probabilistic assessments. Think Casinos, slot machines and lotteries, they all thrive on this mental glitch we have."
58,"Why is it more often than not a bad idea to buy an NFT pre-reveal when you are close to show time, 🧵:

1/ Many NFTs  drop in floor price post reveal. Firstly, why  is it so?

In the price of the pre-reveal token you have to factor in people's expectations of getting a rare."

3. The space completely changes every... 3-4 months?"

71,"@KarafuruNFT @nftworldsNFT 5/ Another use case is for projects that are yet to launch especially to compare how much 'buzz' there is around similar projects not yet on the mkt. The limitation of this for now, is that it might get noisy if too many people 'RT &amp; tag 2 frens for WL' https://t.co/iSU8cANMQV"
72,"@KarafuruNFT @nftworldsNFT 4/ As many nfts are about creating a brand, you might want to know if a project has managed to stay relevant and 'trendy'  throughout time. Hence, getting a moderate uptrend in mentions is awesome (note, ignore feb 8, I started collecting data that night) https://t.co/QEhwiKMJhV"
73,"@KarafuruNFT 3/ Spikes in mentions are what you need to watch out for. It can signal that a price movement might be happening. After the spike, 'going back to previous levels' is normal.  @nftworldsNFT .  👇 https://t.co/09MoOLVNHk"
74,"2/ This is not ALWAYS true, but very often it is. an example re a recent project you might know, @KarafuruNFT 

As twitter mentions start piling up, people get more interested in the project and some (-many) buy in. When interest depletes suddenly... well, it's not that good. https://t.co/5wORYANGsW"
75,"A thread on social signals and why they can turn you into a top 1% NFT investor.

1/  Attention drives everything else.

In the NFT space, when projects fail / lose value it is often because the team failed to keep their project relevant."
