Idk about all the other cats but I’m not wanting to wait 40 days to have enough milk to evolve my pet. I want that ish evolved asap 😂"
27,Currently only 772 holders of $MILK - wonder what the price is going to do when all 10.6k pet holders want milk to evolve their pet instantly 👀 NFA DYOR blah blah blah

43,"Only 2 reasons why these new projects are charging anywhere from .5 - 3 ETH to mint:

1. Cash grab
2. Need revenue to catch up to other established projects that have made millions off royalties

Would much rather see projects grow organically than these enormous ups and downs 🤷🏻‍♂️"

46,@StormyBrick @ShrewdCharlie Every transaction you make (buying or selling). If the USD value of your ETH has gone up when you buy an NFT that’s considering taxable 🥴
