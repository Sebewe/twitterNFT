I’ll probably write a thread on those in the future."
1,@FrankCastiglia Do you buy NFTs on Solana as well?
2,11/ Safe to say that we are excited about what Invisible Friends' future has to hold. It’s always exciting when the entire NFT community can appreciate the work of an artist and propel their career to new heights. How do you guys feel about Markus’ Invisible Friends?
3,"10/ There has also been a confirmed 3d version of the IF in mid 2022 in the form of a collab with @nguyenhut_art. They follow in the footsteps of IF with Markus’ signature walking animation, but take a 3d clay-styled form of Markus’ 2d characters. https://t.co/Wj24M3S5d6"
4,"9/ What’s next for IF and Markus? 

Markus has begun teasing a new potential NFT project, @garbagefriends. But as of now it’s still in its early stages of its development as he’s made no promises, except for hinting at delivering “trash for the metaverse”. 😳  😳"
5,"8/ This hype was definitely reflected during the minting, as @opensea saw an unprecedented amount of activity and had to degrade their API due to the sheer demand. With a reveal date set for just ~36 hours from this tweet, we expect big moves and tons of trading volume!"
6,"7/ Invisible Friends boasts a great items-to-holders ratio, with 5k NFTs held by 4.5k holder addresses. Full disclosure, GrandApeLodge is one of those diamond handed holders 💎🙌"
7,"6/ #invisbleFriends has managed to rack up staggering amounts of hype and attention even before mint. With 500k+ on twitter, a low supply of 5k, an only-WL mint, a low mint price of 0.25 Ξ, AND being artist led, IF has shaped up to be one of the hypest mints of the year."
8,"5/ What is Random Character Collective?

They’re a collective of NFT projects that consist of @slimHoods, @moodRollers, and now IF. RCC’s two other projects, both artist-led and unique, have seen an increase in their floor price and in attention towards them since IF’s reveal."
9,"4/ Markus has already found success creating 1/1s and listing them on his Foundation page. Some have sold for 10+ ETH, and some have taken on his signature cartoon-ey walk. IF is his first full-fledged project and has launched as a part of @RNDMCHARACTERS https://t.co/5T3fNDWWk0"
10,"3/ He teaches a masterclass on creating fluid, realistic, and beautiful walking cycles. His expertise is apparent with the #invisibleFriends. And since the initial teaser, we’ve seen projects flooding to replicate the ‘walking style’. But none can do it like Markus… https://t.co/NNUVlQlnrm"
11,"2/ About Markus Magnusson. 
He’s a Swedish born artist and animator who’s spent a good portion of his life mastering the art of bringing characters to life through perfecting the walk cycle. He’s done animations for Google and Dropbox, and now creates NFTs
https://t.co/ow94kWwAdG"
12,"1/ What is all the hype around @MotionMarkus’s crazy new project, @invsbleFriends? With a recent 1/1 selling for nearly 500 Ξ to @ZeroSalt420, a floor of 9+ Ξ, and 10k Ξ in volume in less than a day, is the hype justified? A thread  🧵 👇"
13,"12/ Fantom has shown us time and again that it has something to prove. As a trader, artist, developer, or hodler, Fantom is shaping up to be a safe place for you to settle down to collect some sweet yield, and an important place to capture some alpha. 😁 😉"
14,"11/ It’d be unfair to cover Fantom NFTs and not mention the bluechip project @worldofumans. She’s created 3 beautiful projects across Fantom and Ethereum that encapsulate and lead the ftm art scene. For a great all-in-one NFT resource, check out @TinFoilRealist https://t.co/mf870hyCkk"
15,"10/ However there has recently been a sense of new growth with over 5,000 sales in the last week, and over $1,500,000 in weekly volume. With this volume comes a huge feeling of community and excitement for NFTs being built on Fantom. @PotluckLabs @TEENSONACID"
16,"9/ The NFT scene on Fantom is still very young. One of the largest NFT marketplaces @paint_swap has only reported 60,000 total sales and $20,000,000 in volume, a fraction of the popular Solana and Ethereum marketplaces."
17,"8/ Our favorite resources for Fantom are @Ftm_ecologist @milesDeutscher @FtmAlerts and @deficryptofarm. By providing insight on new DeFi strategies and  dissecting the busy world of crypto and DeFi, they have become staples and trusted voices in the community"
18,"7/ Dapps on Fantom like @Spookyswap and @Spirit_Swap have become community staples by offering fast and cheap exchanges between tokens and by providing an easy bridge to and from Fantom: Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrum and Polygon."
19,"6/ There are so many great DeFi plays to be made on Fantom. From earning 41% APR single staking $ftm on @PotluckProtocol to earning +300% APR providing liq. for reputable Ftm tokens on @TarotFinance, there are many yield farming opportunities for all types of degens."
20,"5/ Fantom ranks #1 for the lowest Mcap/TVL amongst the DeFi chains at ~0.65. Its YTD TVL growth trumps the likes of #sol, #luna, #one, and #eth. You can see more defi stats at https://t.co/jl9TQj2L8U https://t.co/XHl6x1STtK"
21,"4/ Solana currently has ~2.4M unique addresses with a Mcap of ~35B. Fantom currently has ~2M unique addresses with only a Mcap of ~5B. Solana has ~8.4B in TVL, and Fantom has ~8.9B. They both offer similar value to users in terms of usability yet one is valued at 7x the other. 🤔"
22,"3/ What separates Fantom from some of the top 10 chains? Transactions are near instant and cost pennies. Building on Fantom would require little additional knowledge coming from Ethereum, but opens you to a completely new demographic and new possibilities due to the low fees"
23,"2/ @FantomFDN is Cosmos SDK &amp; EVM compatible, open source, and easy to build on. It’s built on the ‘Lachesis’ consensus mechanism, allowing devs to easily connect &amp; communicate with Fantom. If you want to learn about Lachesis’ other advantages -&gt; https://t.co/Y5jiDffv6K"
24,"1/ #Fantom is a fast growing L1 with almost instant transaction time and super cheap transaction fees. With an actively growing developer base, NFT community, and DeFi presence, here’s everything you need to know about #ftm coming from #eth, #sol, or  #avax. 🧵 👇"

45,"/14 Different engagement
While these are both interesting price discovery mechanisms, the fact that creators are utilizing non-standard “here’s a fee, pay me” pricing mechanics makes the NFT experience richer, more engaging and forces the user to really value their desired NFT"
46,"/13 Best use cases
The Shotgun is best used in a scenario where you are combining 2 “pre-NFT” to get a final NFT. Herbarium is experimenting with combining plant and medicinal properties but it could work for anything that comes in pairs: shoes, outfits, parts to make an item..."
47,"/12 Fair Market Value
The interesting thing about this method is that if you choose to make the initial offer, you must make one that you yourself would be happy to receive back. This makes it more difficult to lowball the offers, ensuring that it tends towards fair market value"
48,"/11b Shotgun Process
The amount that is offered is now the set price for this Shotgun match. The user that has received the offer can choose to give up their item for that price, or pay that same price back to the person who made the offer and take their item."
49,"/11a Shotgun Process
When you mint, there are 2 possible kinds of “pre-NFTs” you can receive. At the end of the mint period, you will be randomly paired to someone who holds the opposite type as you. One of you must offer to buy your counter-party’s item. https://t.co/6MDAGEFvQd"
50,"/10 Herbarium
Not yet launched, the project @HerbariumNFT designed and coded this minting process. They are releasing it as a free mint, as the pricing discovery happens within the Shotgun process itself (they call that “the Duel”) https://t.co/9wuCm3HZnt"
51,"/9 Shotgun Auction
This borrows a business agreement price mechanism called a Shotgun Clause. It allows partners to buy each other out for an equitable price. Bringing this into the NFT space is interesting, as rather than a company, you are helping to price across 1000s of NFTs"
52,"/8 Fairness
We believe the FLP minting mechanic to be fairly well thought out, and leaves your user base with a feeling of satisfaction and fairness. A great review of the numbers was done in this thread https://t.co/vwqhXPDkKD by @turkmmtz"
53,"/7 Raffle Winners
Those who won the raffle will now be able to claim their NFT, while those who didn’t will be able to claim a refund for their raffle ticket. 
The users helped to set the price, they had an equal and fair chance to mint the NFT, and there is no rush to be first."
54,"/6 Users who bid
If you bid below the median price, you’ll be able to update your bid if you’d like to pay to enter the raffle. If you bid over the median, you can choose to participate in the raffle at the mint price or pull back your tokens."
55,"/5 Entering the raffle
With the mint price set, who should get into the mint? After all this is a *fair* mint. You can now buy what is essentially a raffle ticket for the mint price. For example, should the collection hold 10k NFTs but 30k are desired, 30k tickets can be bought"
56,"/4 Setting the price
Once the bid period is finished, the median price is set as the minting price. So while a user may want to spend as low as possible to mint, the lower the entry fee, the greater competition they should expect come mint time. So there is a balance here."
57,"/3 Making a bid
The NFT creator sets a range within which users can bid for what they believe the mint should be set at. To make a bid, they will need to pay an amount as determined by the creator. Typically 0.1 SOL has been seen as the “fair” amount for this price."
58,"/2 Fair Launch Protocol (FLP)
Built and incorporated in the @Metaplex toolkit by @redacted_j, the FLP is a fun way to determine mint price for an NFT. Until now it is the artist or launch platform that decides this. Why not poll the wisdom of the crowd? https://t.co/58h32ZK32c"
59,"/1 While the early narrative around #SolanaNFT was that it was simply copycat projects of Ethereum NFTs, we have seen quite a bit of push back from those who are building for the long term within the Solana ecosystem. We see that many are trying to innovate on Solana"
60,"/0 Price Discovery in the crypto space is very fascinating. Markets born each day and auctions continuously spawn. Continuing our thread on Price Discovery https://t.co/ySRxnRWdz2, we wanted to touch on 2 interesting mechanics unique to #Solana, Fair Launch and Shotgun Auction"

75,"/8b Entry period
Comments must be added within the next 24 hours to be eligible for entry. Guesses must be in before 19:00 UTC on November 6th. #Gotchiverse"
76,"/7 To consider
Remember to adjust the prize pool based on the value you expect resources to add. What will 4k new parcels do to land prices? What will floor prices do between now and the game going live? Those are all subjective decisions but now you have the objective math"
77,"/7 To consider
Remember to adjust the prize pool based on the value you expect resources to add. What will 4k new parcels do to land prices? What will floor prices do between now and the game going live? Those are all subjective decisions but now you have the objective math"
78,"/6 Enter or not?
By dividing the prize pool by the entry cost (2.176m/16) you get 136k entries. Currently there are over 50k entries. If you think it will go above 136k, it may be worth selling your DROP. If you think it will stay below, it may be worth entering your DROP"
79,"/5 Total raffle entries
Since there is no knowing how many tickets will enter the raffle, we can determine how many entries would be needed to make it a positive expected value bet, versus a negative expected value bet. Here’s a good explainer on EV https://t.co/FmyXt6PAoc"
80,"/4 Estimated value of winning
Now that we know the fair market value of all prizes combined, we can divide that by the total amount of prizes (4000 parcels), and we get 544 GHST per winning ticket. Great! But how do I know now if it’s worth entering?"
81,"/3 Total prizes
Multiplying the floor price by the amount of each parcel size, we find:
Humble: 1600 * 160 = 256k GHST
Reasonable: 1600 * 300 = 480k GHST
Spacious: 800 * 1800 = 1.44m GHST
Total: 2.176m GHST in prizes up for grabs (you can adjust this up for resource bonus)"
82,"/2b Resource Bonus
It is worth noting that the floor prices are typically on “naked” land and not ones that have a resource bonus. Until there's more market data, it is hard to impute a fair market value for each bonus, so we’ll leave that up to you to adjust the calculations"
83,"/2a What can you win?
This land raffle includes 4000 parcels of land: 1600 humble, 1600 reasonable, and 800 spacious. Current (rounded) floor prices of each: humble 160, reasonable 300, spacious 1800 (there are a few cheaper spacious, but only a few)."
84,"/1 Quick Recap on DROP and staking
When you stake $GHST, you get FRENS at 1-to-1 rate daily. DROP tickets (the raffle tickets) cost 10k frens each. Currently in Gotchi Baazaar, floor for DROP tickets is ~16 GHST. This means that staking GHST currently yields 55%+"
85,"/0 The @Aavegotchi Land Raffle has begun! https://t.co/Qk8zXHPY3E
One question everyone is asking themselves: Should I enter my DROP tickets, or sell them?
We’re going to break down the economics and help you decide if it’s worth entering, or cashing out for the $GHST #gotchigang"
86,"/13 Diving deeper
Every single one of the points raised above can (and will) be expanded into their own thread. With each new drop we participate in, we see a lot of questions around all of these points popping up at the last minute from potential buyers."
87,"/12 Selling
Now that you’ve determined an entry price you can be happy with, figuring if/when to sell is a whole other discussion. While it’s good to go with an idea of a sell price, the NFT space has shown us many times over that valuations can go parabolic in an instant"
88,"/11c Things to consider - Mint limits
Does the project have a limit on the amount of times a wallet can call their mint function? This can be good as it makes it harder for bots, or bad, as it makes it harder to sell out or for believers to stack up on their favourite projects."
89,"/11b Things to consider - Gas
With some projects, the amount of people trying to rush in at mint time can cause massive gas wars. We’ve seen spikes that shot gas prices from 160 GWEI to over 3000 GWEI for a brief period of time. The amount you spent on gas needs to be factored in"
90,"/11a Things to consider - Royalties
Royalties that go to the creator and to secondary markets need to be kept in mind when deciding a fair value. When selling, the amount you accept will need to be that much higher. Some projects will also split royalties with NFT holders/a DAO."
91,"/10 Increasing auction
Projects can start with a low price as the remaining supply is high, and then slowly increase price along a curve as minting picks up. This rewards early entrants, and helps with floor price increases, as the price anchoring is increased"
92,"/9 Mint pass
To help avoid gas wars, a mint pass can be used to guarantee a user the right to mint. Price discovery occurs on secondary markets before the mint, but also continues after mint begins as it transforms into a “sealed loot box”-type mechanic"
93,"/8 Shotgun Auction
This is taken from the business world. 2 users are paired and 1 needs both “pre-NFT” pieces to mint the NFT. Alice can offer Bob a price for their half, but Bob can pay that same price set by Alice to buy her’s instead. Each need to determine fair market value"
94,"/7b Free mint
It is definitely worth noting that free mints have the ability to really expand the community, as the main barrier to entry becomes speed of minting if there is some hype behind the project. Whales and new users alike can come together on a free mint"
95,"/7a Free mint
The only cost to this mint would be the gas cost of the chain the NFT is minted on. Free mints generally have no barrier to entry, so they are open to a user minting many (on 1 or many addresses), can be seen as “worthless”, or gas fees may be too high at the time"
96,"/6 Fair Launch
Potential buyers can bid on initial minting price within a range set by the creator. Median bid becomes the mint price. From there, users can accept that price, or withdraw their bid from the mint. Wisdom of the crowd is the pricing discovery."
97,"/5 Reverse Auction (aka Dutch Auction)
The mint price starts at a high amount and then lowers (generally in time increments) until users mint. This allows users to determine fair market value. Some may be willing to mint at a higher price, while others believe the FMV is lower"
98,"/4 Standard Mint - Flat Fee
Most common type of mint, a fee is set by the creator and then users buy on a first-come-first-served basis. Pricing discovery happens 1st by the metric of how quickly it sells out, 2nd by what offers come on secondary market and 3rd by accepted offers"
99,"/3 Hype
Some projects have a well-tuned marketing machine behind them, with insane graphics/videos, good contests, good memes. Some are featured on popular marketplace pages in the upcoming section, some have influencers talking about them (not just shilling)"
