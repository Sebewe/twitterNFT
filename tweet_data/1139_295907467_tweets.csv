88,RT @CryptoProtest: I like this thesis.
89,@JuliusCrypto I understand. I would argue that punks &amp; BAYC help make NFTs relevant. But I understand maybe I’m thinking to deep. But I just like the idea of collecting some of the earliest pfps. Not even to flip but to see where they are in 10 years tbh

93,"@JuliusCrypto I have a bag load of historical projects from 2016-2018. 

10k pfp collections made NFT’s relevant and is helping bring mass adoption. Punks, doodles, BAYC, Cool cats, Azuki, etc. all I’m saying collecting the 1st few to exist is a cool concept."
94,"@BlackstarXXI @Crypto_Skulls @PunksVoxels @DooggiesNFT @etherthings Maybe, or maybe not. Maybe every major social media platform integrates NFT pfps like how Twitter did in the coming months. 

You and I literally have nft pfps lol"

I created a discord to talk about it in more detail: https://t.co/doEaaZmn9K

1. CrytpoPunks (The Father)

3. ChainFaces 
4. SimpsonsGan
5. Chubbies 
6. PixelGan
7. @PunksVoxels

Some of these are as cheap as. 01 Eth. Why not collect? NFA NFA

97,"Pfps are literally the most popular type of NFT’s. They have undoubtedly revolutionized the Internet forever, and it’s just the start. 

My thesis remains the same: collect the earliest pfps that’ll be “historically” relevant in 10 years when mass adoption arrives. 

2/4 https://t.co/6zbvtqPGWM"
98,"The 1st few NFT’s I ever bought were historical NFTs. Pepes, Curio Cards, SOG, Etherlambos, and I haven’t sold 1 yet! 

My thesis was simple, these early assets will still be relevant in 10 years. They felt like a “safe bet”

1/4 https://t.co/bP8XQgnwuL"
99,"@Madiba_NFT I started collecting true historical NFTs like Pepes, curio, etc for similar reasons. As NFT’s grow these early assets should rise in value right? 

Pfps are literally the most popular types of NFT’s. it’s thesis we are degening on 😂"
