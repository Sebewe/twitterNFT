4,"@TgCmdrVIPER @orange__ape I find that if they're too stretchy, they end up halfway up my forearm by the morning haha. The current default braided one works pretty good imo."
5,@brendandunne Lol this exact thing happened to me with the Fragment pairs 🤣
6,"@orange__ape Depends on the bracelet you’re using, but most are great!

I have the Milanese Loop one, but the magnetization loosens it throughout the night.

The current default braided one is very comfortable imo. 

The classic silicone one is good for sleeping as well."
7,@bobbyhundreds @scampbell333 @_dr_woo_ @jhubberman @scabshop Dr. Woo the legend!
8,"@orange__ape I track my sleep pretty closely with an app called AutoSleep. I've tracked my sleep every single night for the last 4 years with my Apple Watch.

Also love the other health metric apps like HeartWatch and Training Today."
9,"@risinggoesham Oh my god lol.. is this from deep in your iCloud? haha. So cool.

I saw OF in like... 2012? Didn't see Frank until 2017. Both up here in Canada.

Must've been cool to be in LA during that time :)"

Everyone will realize then."
37,"@F_Nela1 @iamtomnash You could have said the same about $TSLA in 2017 after years of trading flat.

“Can’t expect investors to hang on” then you’re not an investor.

If you have a 10-year time horizon, then what the price movements do over that time period is irrelevant."
38,"@iamtomnash &gt; “Roku is making low margin TVs and Firestick knock offs to make customer retention sticky” *bets everything on Roku*

68,"@thecryptocris @CodyL3wis @richerd I'm bullish on NFTs in the long run - it's obvious, but 95% of the people in this space are just here for money and they're going to get wrecked - same as the dotcom bubble. They lost everything and never came back. Same will happen again."
69,"@thecryptocris @CodyL3wis @richerd To be frank: NFTs aren't ""investments"" because they're just gambling if you view it that way. Cryptocurrencies are enabling financial freedom for those victim to hyperinflation. Stocks are backed by an actual company. 98% NFTs are backed by almost nothing. It's just gambling."
70,"@thecryptocris @CodyL3wis @richerd I understand that there is financial opportunity in NFTs, but I don't care. I want to buy NFTs for projects that are doing cool new things to be a part of the ride. I'm down 95% on some and up 2000% on others, but I don't care because I'm not selling anything."
71,"@breezyJDA @thecryptocris @richerd There are also lots of great projects, but anytime you visit their Discord server it's 15 people just talking about floor price, whether or not they should delist, taking profits, floor predictions, etc.

It's all about money. 

Money this, money that."
72,@MyMon3yWorks4Me @MarketRebels $COIN is a money printer. They exceeded revenue by like $500 million last quarter. They could easily just cut them off and it wouldn't affect them much tbh.
73,"@PeterDiamandis The obvious one is healthcare.

I hate using the post office and there isn't a viable seamless alternative yet. I wish there was a way I could package up all my goods to be mailed out, then go to a box where I don't have to interact with anyone and just drop everything off."

76,@Jason 🤣🤣🤣
77,"@ElizabethKerr @Frenchy_1980 @lexfridman Russia is guaranteed to lose.

While it is true that hundreds of thousands of US troops on the border of a NATO Ukraine would pose a security threat, this current invasion is totally unprovoked and evil.

If they choose to escalate it to nuclear, then of course they should lose."

81,"@flugelhaft @lexfridman The USA is more secure than Russia by an almost incalculable level of magnitudes. 

Russia would be a glass parking lot in the click of a button. 

Whether or not any damage would be done to the USA is impossible for anyone on the outside to determine."

It's strange, I feel like if I were on top, I'd try to find the person just coming up to cosign, but I guess it's different here."
95,"@allnick Appreciate you bringing this up.
