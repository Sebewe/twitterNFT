45,"@BucNasty20 I want to buy the dip, but I don't have any cash on hand... hopefully low prices continue until next week"
46,"@DipBuyer_1 Haha, you think it will go that low? Exchange listings are right around the corner"
47,Looks like $OMI is way down today-- .0046 on BitForex. Great buying opportunity before exchange listings. https://t.co/SBVVyQHYdS
48,"@DipBuyer_1 I'm seeing .0046 on BitForex, so yeah it's way down"
49,@DipBuyer_1 It just dropped to .0049 on CoinMarketCap… wonder if it’s a bug on their end? Not seeing it with other coins. https://t.co/duIuzVOcGt

67,"@IdisconnectfrmU @TheWestRoad1 @Chaosium_Inc The value is predicated on getting to own digital collectibles of brands you love. Virtually every large company is working on projects related to the metaverse, so I doubt this is a passing fad. The future is digital."
68,@CoachedbyDO 🤣🤣🤣
69,"@TheWestRoad1 @Chaosium_Inc They’re collectibles, they don’t need utility. You collect them &amp; you can display them in AR or VR through the VeVe app. Once VeVe released its metaverse project (VeVeVerse) you’ll be able to showcase them in your digital space too. Things don’t need to be physical to have value"
70,@Chaosium_Inc Big shame that cancel culture has become so prevalent in the gaming community and people feel the need to attack new technologies they don’t even understand
71,"@TheWestRoad1 @Chaosium_Inc Or we’re Cthulhu fans that enjoy digital collectibles. But now due to the complaints of luddites we won’t be able to enjoy any new Chaosium items. VeVe collectibles are carbon-neutral, so I don’t understand why some people feel the need to cancel something that others enjoy"

98,@Cvers8 Depends on the mint size... still doesn't make sense selling off the cards to get the new ones tho
99,"@nft_pirates Lenticular cards are the first appearance of Donald, etc. on the blockchain. Steamboat Willie is a historic piece even without FE/FA tags. People are making a big deal about VeVe's tags and missing out on future gains by letting go of grail pieces."
