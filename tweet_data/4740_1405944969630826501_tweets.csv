13,"To have ownership of something, you need to be able to assert control over it. 

Assets you don’t have custody of (eg. held in banks and custodial exchanges) are only yours via the social contract that says the bank must grant you access to them. This can be revoked arbitrarily. https://t.co/1JrBFbVTLV"

81,Touching on a lot of the themes we addressed in our most recent announcement. Thoughts worth reading 📖 https://t.co/XljT9GB802
82,"@samonchain @poapxyz @gitcoin Thanks @samonchain - appreciate the model. It's a thorny issue, and we're learning."
83,"We're building POAP as a highly experimental social technology, designed to address the challenge of scaling human networks. 

ICYMI, this article covers how we see the next few decades of human evolution. 

https://t.co/g5awzKlVhz"
84,"Diligent collectors understand the value of this, and treat their collections as an opportunity to curate the story of their lives. A great POAP collection creates a granular image of the collector, and the things that matter to him."
85,There's incredible value in helping people  who are working on the same problem find each other. A POAP collection is a verifiable record of the times you cared enough about an issue to show up.
86,"@crypt0zan @TralfamadorNode @poapxyz That said, the current operating structure of POAP is what best addresses the challenges we're going to face on the way there. 

I'm truly sorry we're not able to give you a more satisfying solution at this time - we're working on it."
87,"@crypt0zan @TralfamadorNode @poapxyz I empathize with the frustration, and we're working on building a case for why our activity shouldn't be subject to the sanctions our infrastructure providers otherwise enforce. 

We know that at the end of the day, the best version of POAP is a fully decentralized protocol."
