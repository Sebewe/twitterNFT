39,I love the idea of earning #wrld tokens passively from #nftprojects building on @nftworldsNFT BUT dont forget.. Minecraft owned by Microsoft.. What happens if they decide to launch a p2e token?? Sometimes we can forget as we are in a #nft bubble.. #nftcommunity #nftcollectors
40,The real #wrld money in p2e games built on @nftworldsNFT is not in the staking revenue. It’s in the actual games being awesome &amp; tons of gamers wanting to play them. That’s the real challenge. #nftcommunity #nfts #nftcollectors
41,So.. @nftworldsNFT #wrld airdrop &amp; staking in the next 3-4 days.. that means #wrld tokens for @nftworldsNFT holders + holders of a variety of different #nftprojects that are rewarding their holders as well. Exciting times.. #nftcommunity #nfts #nftcollectors

55,@TieDyeNinjas @HeroGalaxyNFT @nikolas_eth Nice one. Are you producing #WRLD passively for those staked. As I’m not a gamer. That’s what interests me.
56,@LFGEVERYDAY_ @HeroGalaxyNFT @nikolas_eth That’s tough as none yet have started staking &amp; p2e games for the public. @HeroGalaxyNFT have a game &amp; another out shortly. Staking mid March. This so far has the best potential. Time will tell.
57,"p2e is the new buzz word.. ""We're gonna build a p2e game"", ""We're about to start building a p2e game"" Sounds OK.. What sounds better? ""We have a f*ckin p2e game &amp; another one out in a few days. Thats why I bought @HeroGalaxyNFT @nikolas_eth #nftcommunity #nfts #nftcollectors"
