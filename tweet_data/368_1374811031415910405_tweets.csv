40,"@sergitosergito would be nice to replace phrase ""NFT in my wallet"" with ""NFT I can control"" or ""NFT that calls me owner"""
41,@imalexandra_eth @InvsbleFriends 😂 it’s probably RandomCharacterCollectve fund. Their own fund 🤔

90,@ForNft Meeting you was a highlight of the trip for me! 🤝
91,@WordOnThe_ @lphaCentauriKid @triumph36_gm @richerd I don’t think in any case you would want to be listening to a twitter space’s advice regardless of who hosts it
92,@lphaCentauriKid @triumph36_gm @richerd Look. It’s not permanent. People can learn and improve. I’d also advise folks to avoid twitter spaces as well
93,@richerd Take the top X influencers in the space and split them into “likely to spread hysteria/misinformation” vs “likely to know what they’re doing”
94,@richerd I think it would be important to have on that page a list of folks you should and should not look to for technical advice.
95,@ProbCause gm!
96,@art_pleb @superphiz @coinbase @krakensupport @prylabs It’s about client diversity! More resiliency
