42,"@EoghanSCrowley 100% agree, putting in more effort on the connecting and conversing."
43,"@slurpineth @NFTbark @thingdoms @skominers @EoghanSCrowley @lukeabc Appreciate your extra input. Digging into some of the medium articles I will credit the team with giving a bit more into who they are. 

And again im not anti anything I just want to be extra safe in this market. And any errors on my end I do apologize to the team"
44,"@EoghanSCrowley @NFTbark @thingdoms I really appreciate the replies, and will definitely do my reading. Thank you @EoghanSCrowley"
45,"@Vinnybombom1 @DerivativeApes This probably took a lot of time. You are talented my friend and your work is appreciated, thank you for sharing."
46,@CaleCrypto https://t.co/pdSdNwQJTL
47,@NFTbark @thingdoms If anyone can elaborate about them to persuade me that it’s a safe project where the founders won’t disappear more than the non transparent ness they already have then I would be willing to convert.
48,"@NFTbark @thingdoms With NFTs being like the wild Wild West I think the risk of a rug pull is too high for thingdoms.

Of course that may never happen it is just me looking through my new glasses at the project. And if they make a meteoric rise I will miss it."
49,@NFTbark @thingdoms Their goal about the “THINGDOM” with different utilities sounds neat but doesn’t tell you any thing and their discord doesn’t have any extra info.
50,@NFTbark @thingdoms So I was looking into thingdoms last night and with what happened to the leaders of noundles recently made me take a close look at the project. The website has very generic names of the team and no links to actual profiles no description of who they are.
51,On my personal tweets 0 engagement but my replies to other accounts gets 3 likes. This is Twitter life
52,@Helloimmorgan Exactly what a boy would say…

54,All that’s been crossing my mind is the solution to the stock market is NFTs. There couldn’t be synthetic tokens and it would be same day delivery into wallets. Companies could issue NFTs with all of the same perks of the stock. No stock without proof of ownership.THISISTHEWAY

69,Its cool collecting more jpgs and all but flipping them at the price you want to sell them at is not the easiest thing. I am willing to take a hit to pay for my education this round.
70,"I only flipped it for some much needed liquidity, I haven't been able to participate in any new mints. And as previously mentioned I am trying to increase the size of my bag."
71,"being new to the space I am trying to increase the size of my Bag$ and I had to sell my DUNK (doodled punk) I made .02 eth on it including gas. On Mint day I could have made .3 eth which would have been a 400% return. Lesson learned, don't get greedy or caught holdin the bag."
