13,"Marketing teams will be busy maintaining high levels of user engagement and identity building. Moving from top-down planning and executing, to growing communities and making them flourish organically.🌳"
14,"While some Web2 strategies are still useful, marketing efforts must focus on community strength and long-term user commitment. Tokens and DAOs will be the core aspects of future decentralized projects.🤝"

27,10. Communities and participation are the core aspects of this new web3 paradigm. That’s why creating buzz by renting ad spaces on Times Square might highly engage the existing core group of adopters instead of reaching out for new customers.
28,9. We are experiencing a deep shift in marketing approaches in the web3 era. Tokenomics and other models gaining importance massively in the blockchain ecosystem. Some of them might not work as before but can still create a different kind of value. https://t.co/CP6D9GOCIr
29,"8. Don’t get me wrong, I’m ok with it. I love watching NFTs (ideally the one I’m holding, ofc) appearing on billboards, monitors, everywhere. However, I think this might be creating additional value to the project itself rather than attracting new people. https://t.co/05IQuBAMtn"
30,"7. Is it truly a medium for actively gaining interest in an NFT collection, a new de-fi protocol, or just a sophisticated 3.0 flex? Eg. A Cross social post with NFT on Times Squared captioned “Probably nothing” 🙄 
Or is it something more, something new?"
31,"6. The exposure given by these billboards is great. Yet what I'm thinking is different. Showing your NFTs on Times Square is surely a strong move, but the pictures of it, spread on social media might have a different kind of value."
32,"5. Also, who wouldn’t want their brand or logo in Times Square?? Exactly, no one with a basic comprehension of marketing strategies. As stated by @TimesSquareNYC, nearly 360k pedestrians enter Times Square, with ads reaching 1.5 million impressions each day https://t.co/QoyKN4408r"
33,"4. “Hey but being there that must cost a fortune”. Well yeah, while still not being cheap, renting spaces got more affordable, and relatively smaller brands got to taste the feeling of being up there, among giants such as Coca-Cola, Spotify, and many others."
34,"3. OK, WOW what is this? CONTINUUM by @Krista_Kim, a mesmerizing art performance consisting of an extreme takeover of the whole square for three minutes. The piece was lately auctioned as NFT at @Sothebys  by @steveaoki https://t.co/TKzqSG3r25"
35,"2. Apes, m’fers, gurus, punks... you name it. They’re taking the spotlight with their massive occurrence on LCD walls, digital vans driving around, etc. Here we can see @sartoshi_nft’s m’fers in all their m’fucking glory. 📷@DanielKiani https://t.co/ATB08oYzAe"
36,"1. While we proceed in this amazing journey in the world of NFTs, I’m noticing some kind of pattern that caught my eye. 👀 Almost every day we see the presence of nonfungible characters on the most iconic billboards of Times Square, NY city. https://t.co/YIMJPgXPl5"
37,"NFTs in Times Square:  Search for exposure or 3.0 flexing? 
Probably we should have titled it: “How to reward your community while massively showing off” but still...

85,"3/ Embedded virality. The team at Coinbase knows that the best #superbowlads get a lot of coverage the next day. They ensured the ad would keep being effective when shared on mainstream media and social channels (have you tried scanning the QR in the#gif? if not, try now) https://t.co/O2Ue2GfbWA"
86,2/ Flawless execution. The animation and the music reference Pong (a famous arcade game from the 70') and resonate with a gaming-oriented audience. https://t.co/2mPKabDSdO
87,"How did @Coinbase crack the perfect #superbowl22 #ad?
Not #NFT related, but interesting for the #marketer part of my #JPG

1/ Brilliant use of the medium.
Keeping a floating QR-code on screen for 60'' created a strong CTA, + they gave people time to grab the phone $ scan the code https://t.co/1rv95EbIUL"
88,"@doodlespuzzles @opensea nice! I got no clue what this is about, but nice!"

Wen @supergremplin and @Sartoshi launch CC0 projects, they create circularity.

If you're approaching this world thinking about selling one more product, you're trying to fit a rectangle into a circle. Unfortunately, it probably isn't going to work. https://t.co/yHjw2CQ1Vo"
90,"Mini thread on circularity.
1/
#NFTs redefine a historically linear relationship (buyer-seller). 
Wen @Poopie anticipates wrapping @doodles to distribute royalties to holders, or @BoredApeYC and @warpsound_ai give commercial rights to the owners, they are creating circularity. https://t.co/EPFByFsVXQ"
