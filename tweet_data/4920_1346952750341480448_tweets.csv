13,@hagaetc oops I just want to get a table with all ethereum.transactions entries but I guess you caught me
14,"@afletsas @richardchen39 @0xPolygon I'm sure it helped a bit but I don't think that Polygon has a very big impact on Ethereum, Sushi also had a rough last few months.

Will be nice to analyse that once dune offers for cross chain queries, that way we can track usage of addresses accross multiple chains"

33,"@zxsasha_ @carolousue @the_x2y2 I disagree here. Most of the zero royalty fees trades on LR are traded at prices similar to those seen on OS which makes sense given that a user benefits from doing the same trade on LR over OS. Here is my method for filtering out wash trading on LR:

My current method is:
1. Have a problem or a question
2. Find the answer on stackoverflow

Which isn't the method I would recommend starting with, that is more useful once you are familiar with the basics"
71,@NBAtrollsDOTcom I agree but I would argue that SQL has an even lower barrier to entry than Python.
72,"@armillspaugh No it isn't you are right, understanding the data you're studying should always be your number one priority regardless of the field.

But most of my followers follow me for web3 data analytics, so I just mentioned that."
73,Those are quite pricey options so I want to make sure I'm taking the right choice before I consider buying one.
74,"My experience with hardware wallets is far from optimal lately so I want to tryout new options.

I'm seeing @gridplus and @KeystoneWallet. Which is the best option? And are there other options I have missed?"
75,"@litterypaws @SBF_FTX Even under strict guidelines you have a lot of options:

- Excluding the irrelevent data while keeping what is essential
- What's the best visualisation to clearly convey as much as possible?
- What story should lead up to the presented data?

All of those play an important role"
76,"@abecadariun @SBF_FTX Any dataset can be used to create an infinite amount of datasets and visualisations. Only a very select few of those are important.

The hardest is selecting the fewest possible in order to convey as much info as possible in a clear and concise manner."
77,RT @SBF_FTX: 1) People suck at presenting results form a scientific study.
78,"@SBF_FTX Producing data is easy. The hard part is:
- Producing the right data
- Presenting it in the clearest and most concise way possible
- Trying to cover all aspects of what you're studying and not having your data induce a bias

Only the very best data scientists master those 👑"

Seems like a good way to match supply and demand without a gas war 🤷"
