2,Happy to be a part of @MonaverseNFT ! 1/1 hand-drawn art by @_____basloveyou inspired by my sith kongz. Amazing work of making 1234 unique hand drawn pieces of mona. https://t.co/ExuOYMnQYd
3,"I don't think it's worth it to keep watching the market (or chart) closely to get 10-20% extra and i love holding my JPEGs bag. I prefer to hangout with friends, have a life and do sports. Need that during bear market as stress relieved!
🧵
11/11"
4,"I'm not that good at trading and when you love eth and treat it as your main currency, you will be very nervous when eth price bounce a bit and you're holding stable. I tend to do stupid things when trying to time the market and mostly ended up with small profit or loss.
🧵
10/11"
5,"Why i didn't sell before or when the dip started and bought back when it reached bottom or when it start recovering?
🧵
9/11"
6,"It's no different in NFT. People always trading with emotion and some will do stupid things in fear. Fear make us stupid but you need to remain calm. Remember why you bought in first place, assess if that reason has been changed. If not, why bother selling?
🧵
8/11"
7,"My strategy is always, buy the dip. Pick the project you like and believe and buy the dip when everyone is selling and floor is down. There will always good deal in market during that time and trading is always about transferring money from the impatient to the patient.
🧵
7/11"
8,"I told her that i'll give her 10% of any profit i made on my trade. She got nothing to lose and took it as bonus if i did got profit. Imagine what she'll get now!! 
🧵
6/11"
9,"I didn't have much money back then and i started with $5.5k only (put it gradually during 2018) + $2k friend's money that she put in me as she want to buy mana and hold but didn't know how so i helped her and used the money as my additional firepower to trade DCL land.
🧵
5/11"
10,"In my mind, 1 eth is 1 eth, no matter what the $ price is. My purpose is always to gather as many eth (mana at that time as i traded DCL land) as possible. 
🧵
4/11"
11,"I saw eth dipped to $80 where all crypto were in the brink of the death (eth to 0 felt so real). Afaicr, i rarely traded my crypto into stable during the dip and only once cashed out before 2021 (regret it, sold the bottom and would be at least 100x if i sold last year). 
🧵
3/11"
12,"I have been in NFT space for almost 4 years now (March 7 was my nonce 0 transaction), eth was $750 at that time (I got into crypto in Oct 2017 tho during decentraland first land sale, but didn't manage to get any because i didn't know what metamask was). 
🧵
2/11"
13,"Buy when people are in fear and wait til confidence is back and people buying in greed, to then sell and book your profit. Especially if your really believe in the project and overall NFT space for the long-run.

41,@YuekiNFT @KarafuruNFT No legendary for me haha.
42,"Lesson from @KarafuruNFT . When creating a project, finding a good artist is the no 1 priority above all. If the art is good, any other else doesn't really matter. Make something that people wanna proudly put as their pfp even if it's a common one."
43,"Gotta say, @KarafuruNFT 95 legendaries are a lot. But hats off to @WD_Willy for drawing so many 1/1 on top of 12 base with different traits for each base. All are so good! Being the first with so many legendaries in a collection, karafuru might be starting a trend now!"
