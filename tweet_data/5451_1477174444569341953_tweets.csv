11,"@chriscantino B for sure✨🔥
A) means u r the business owner and take full responsibility. U really need to “work”🥲
B) means u r probably like an investor.
U r not responsible for the daily operation. So u don’t really need to “work” 😎"
12,I am not holding a #InvisibleFriends . But quite sure this project will definitely own a place in the #NFT history given its very unique style of art and the inspiration to other #NFTartist and #NFTCollection https://t.co/lKFv6VnJVg

What a marketing stunt by the @InvsbleFriends team 👍🏻
On one hand it is for charity, on the other hand it will definitely help to raise the floor price when the project rolls out.

63,@CardilloSamuel Thanks so much for your info. I have clicked to revoke the particular NFT (ERC-721). Status is successful in etherscan. But why that NFT collection is still showing in the list? I have something missed? 🤔
64,"“Make sure to check Etherscan token checker to revoke any contract you have no clues about. A good OPSEC strategy is to do that continuously and/or revoke contracts access when you finished using them.”

91,"@_cryptobolt_ @3landersNFT @3landboy Agree, but seems it’s not their focus: “We believe that at the end of the day, NFT collections and communities are centered around identity; so this is our primary “first” goal rather than outwardly promising any number of different “hype utilities” just for the sake of hype.”"
92,@_cryptobolt_ @3landersNFT @3landboy Now getting into the WL is getting harder and harder for all NFT projects 🤦🏻‍♂️
93,"6/ The roadmap is so vague. There is no solid steps or timeline for what to do next. Basically it is not really a roadmap but rather like a vision statement.

What do you think? 

***Not a financial advice. Do your own research. I am wrong all the time. Not in the whitelist 🥲 https://t.co/NWq4xHl9UO"
94,"4/ The art style is trending. See similar: @coolcatsnft @doodles @CoolmanUniverse High contrast colour scheme with bold outlines. Perfect as a profile pic. 

5/ IP belongs to you. Yeah! https://t.co/cVdpPd4ojQ"
95,"2/ Experienced in NFT. 3Land Word at OS is at 1.49Ξ FP. Artwork at Foundation was sold for 4.55Ξ.

3/ Real world exposure. You can not just see his artworks in his Behance portfolio, but you can also see exhibitions about his artworks in a shopping mall. https://t.co/aAEkxYr49m"
96,"Public mint of @3landersNFT will be on 20 Feb 10am EST. Dutch auction start at 0.75Ξ. Just to record some of my thoughts, nothing ground-breaking.

1/ The team is not anonymous. Thai artist @3landboy is in Japan having track records. A doxxed team seems to be crucial from now on. https://t.co/WzIR7VaY7A"
97,@KINGOFCLONEX @_ConorSweeney So generous 👍🏻 It helps to keep the clone family grow ✨
98,@0xWuda @CoolmanUniverse @coolcoffeedan Absolutely. It also gives more confidence to the hodlers that the roadmap will/can be delivered.
99,@mrmakerbot @_cryptobolt_ @CoolmanUniverse @coolcoffeedan The IP limitation may be inherited from its real world legal settings 🤔
