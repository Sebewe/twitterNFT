29,"@BordoniAndres @TheTreeverse @Worldwide_WEB3 I believe that in normal companies, there are people separated into divisions who are responsible for doing different things. 

These are bonus assets for 3rd party platforms to use openly, and give holders an additional function for their NFT by using it as an identity elsewhere"

78,"@infamousbtw Yes, I’m agreeing it’s a bubble, that’s why i used the dotcom comparison. My point is that even during bubbles there will emerge big winners.  Early participation is a risk vs reward scenario.  That’s why many people will continue to be sceptical for years to come.  It’s normal"
79,"@infamousbtw It’s a newly emerging industry and it’s normal to question and doubt.  But the tens of billions flowing to R&amp;D shows the tech is here to stay.

Early participation is very risky but also very rewarding if you successfully weed out the winners. It’s like dotcom leading to web2"
