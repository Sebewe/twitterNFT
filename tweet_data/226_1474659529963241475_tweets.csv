2,@doops_eth @MonoLocco_ @Shizuka_NFT @EtherealartNFT Great thread. These high cost mints with no real strong value proposition don’t do much to help the space or the legitimacy of NFTs. Totally agree that merch and collabs should not be a core function of a project’s roadmap 🤝

9,"Seriously, @BattleFlyGame is looking dope as hell. Congrats to @PeachNFT and the rest of the team on a really excellent lead-up to launch.

A completely free mint with this level of production value is totally possible. This is the @Treasure_DAO way.

Excited to mint my 3! 🦋 https://t.co/N6sLZZSb7e"

23,"We love the @Pixelmon Kevin meme - but keep in mind that raising the Kevin floor means that the team is receiving even more $ from royalties.

28,@SkiddilyNFT Great guide. We need more content like this to help people learn to trade in the most informed manner possible. Great contribution to the community 🤝
29,"Great guide from @SkiddilyNFT on strategies for building a bankroll with mints.

There's no shame in selling for a quick profit - people who hold benefit from the potential upside, but also bear the risk of a project tanking.

31,"@eranthe_eth @OriginsNFT @kpwaltman I live in a jurisdiction with no capital gains tax, so I'm probably the worst person to ask tbh.

I think she should have plenty of resources available on her twitter feed, so worth having a look there first!"
32,@eranthe_eth Unfortunately not - this will also be jurisdiction specific and I'm definitely not a tax expert. Definitely worth speaking to a tax expert. At @OriginsNFT we previously engaged @kpwaltman for her insights

35,"Greetings, friends.

As you may know, I write a lot of threads which contain my personal thoughts relating to the NFT space.

For ease of reference, I have set up a linktree with links to each of these threads: https://t.co/PH3aloaeaO

Thanks, as always, for reading! 🤝"
36,@ImAbvAvg @cb1crypto @Pixelmon For sure - and certainly the most web3 thing would be some form of web3 regulatory body. But we would probably need to do a lot of work to pave the way before we could get to that... likely will be some mix of old school/web3 to be most effective and practical regulatory body.
37,@illumanbeing @Pixelmon Thank you! Appreciate the thoughtful questions 🙏
38,"These are all interesting questions that I want to spend more time reading up on and considering. Fundamentally we won't know for sure until this is rigorously tested in court, and/or laws and regulations are written. But we can certainly speculate in the interim... 🤔

Gn 💤"
39,"There is also a question about what standards will end up forming the threshold of ""mis-selling"" or ""misrepresentation"" with NFT marketing.

Regulation is inevitable - and we don't know yet what form that will take, and what that will look like for us all when it comes."
40,"There will also be conflicts of laws issues. Which jurisdiction's laws will apply if founders are located in one country, but holders are spread across the world? 

Investment contracts contain governing law and dispute resolution clauses - smart contracts do not."
41,"Firstly, we need to determine the classification of an NFT in the eyes of the law. Is it an asset? Is it a right? What rights attach to ""ownership"" on the blockchain?

This will likely differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as well. One could prob write a textbook on just this."
42,"I'm getting a lot of  questions on potential legal recourse for @Pixelmon holders. This leads to an interesting string of questions, which I intend to do some deep dives into as I continue to educate myself and research.

For now, here are some completely off the cuff thoughts 📜"
43,"@ImAbvAvg @cb1crypto @Pixelmon Logistically would be difficult. There's also a question of which jurisdiction's laws apply if the dev is in NZ and holders are spread out across the world, as well as how to even classify an NFT as an asset. Totally agree with you re: investor protection - regulation is needed."
44,@BubbIesOfficiaI @SkiddilyNFT https://t.co/XzraFaXybg
45,"@illumanbeing For sure. I think there's a lot to figure out with this one - conflicts of law issues given that devs and holders will be in different jurisdictions, the nature of the NFT as an asset itself, standards for mis-selling and fraudulent misstatement... def interesting things to come."
46,"@ImAbvAvg @cb1crypto @Pixelmon Realistically speaking, now that he is doxxed it would be entirely possible to make a claim against him. But the question is on what grounds - my guess would be that the strongest claim might be in fraudulent misrepresentation, but it's hard to say for uncharted waters like this."
47,"@PFPofTheWeek Thanks for reading! Agreed - I think this is inevitable as the spaces feels itself out and develops the ""norm"". This is inherent to new spaces. The dotcom era experienced the same thing. Widespread adoption of blockchain technology is inevitable - regulation will catch up in time"
48,"@omega_eth @SkiddilyNFT Congratulations 🔥 absolutely well deserved. Can't believe people are sleeping on the Omega alpha (gamma?)

52,"@mxubeats @Pixelmon there's definitely something here. currently just too disproportionate where risk is concentrated with investors, who share too much of the downside and too little of the upside."

54,@cryptodontist32 @AzukiZen I wish!! What a steal - an amazing bean to say the least 🥰
55,@HikenSabowo @Pixelmon thank you so much! 🙏
56,"Some happy news - @ShogunWarNFT had a fantastic mint experience, and like other $MAGIC projects, it was completely free.

I don't feel any incentive to sell rn for liquidity, and am happy to ride it out since I have no cost basis for entry. This is the way forward 👏 https://t.co/A0qVbt34hw"
57,"@RembrandtNext It would be a long road to get there for sure. This is a completely untested area of law, and it would be a challenge even figuring out where to bring the proceedings. No idea how that would look at present."
58,"@0xMagik I think that's right, and probably true for most NFT projects. No real underlying value proposition, everything is just propped up on hype and speculation. Unfortunately very similar to the dotcom bubble. I personally am just reinvesting all profits in projects I believe in."

64,@SkiddilyNFT Thanks for the love @SkiddilyNFT ❤️ totally agreed - I’m instantly more intrigued when I see a number of these names following (or indeed discussing) a project. Appreciate the shoutout 🤝
65,"Thanks for reading as always.

I truly hope we can push this space forward by looking at these projects the same way we do with traditional investments. Only by taking what will serve us best from web2, will we continue to sophisticate and push forward web3.

Onwards and upwards."
66,"19/ And finally, I also think we need to eradicate the concept that it is acceptable to dox someone and make death threats to them and their family. This is simply unacceptable. We should absolutely require more from projects - but we should similarly require more from ourselves."
67,"20/ Free mints are also an option. There is a compelling argument from @WickdNFT on how free mints incentivize builders to keep building, while removing a concentration of risk in the hands of investors. This is certainly a possible and viable solution. https://t.co/wFcVF1rtqL"
68,"19/ We need to encourage things to actually be done before we invest. Marketing materials are one thing, finished products are another. If devs require early stage investment, they should do a limited release, raising only what they need. S/o to @kurorobeast who did this well."
69,18/ We need to insist on greater transparency with how funds are being used. There are multiple ways to do this - escrow mechanisms where funds are slowly released to founders/devs over time as they work towards their stated roadmaps or hit certain milestones would be a start.
70,"17/ So, the takeaways as I see them:

Being early in the NFT space means that retail investors are subject to unique risks. There are no market protections, meaning that anyone can aggressively (and dishonestly) market a project however they wish."
71,"16/ If a sophisticated investor was trying to buy into an early stage web2 company, and was informed that the founders were going to straight up pocket a percentage of the investment proceeds (however small) for themselves, I can assure you that investor would promptly turn away."
72,"15/ Respectfully, I do not think it is at all justified to take a % of the proceeds for an unfinished project. The devs should be paying themselves a small, modest salary for their continued work and involvement with the project. https://t.co/TcepYDB2uC"
73,"14/ And finally, the use of dev funds to buy bluechip NFTs. Syber's response to this has been quite consistent across twitter: the devs paid themselves ""less than 5% of the funds raised"" for the time and work spent on Pixelmon.

For reference, 5% of 70m is 3.5m. https://t.co/GWjcL5uJTb"
74,"13/ Firstly, there was absolutely no transparency about using Unity modelers prior to the mint. 

Secondly, these models were used in various marketing materials and teasers - i.e. they were used to induce retail investors to invest.

At the minimum, this is misrepresentation."
75,"12/ Syber has also since come out to say that Unity modelers were hired to work on pre-models before funding was received.

While this may seem reasonable, I personally do not think it is for two reasons: https://t.co/b3IUShraSG"
76,"11/ This is a pretty big red flag in and of itself - even if we take the most generous interpretation (i.e. the team was lazy and uninspired, not fraudulent), do we really want to be backing a team which goes out to investors to raise 70m but can't even make fully custom assets?"
77,"10/ This doesn't seem to address the whole issue. Some CT sleuths including @V1zhual have found instances where Unity assets bore a striking resemblance to finished Pixelmon - suggesting that certain assets may have simply been reskinned and shipped.
https://t.co/utOxQCFNLI"
78,"9/ Regarding the use of Unity assets - one of my fellow @OriginsNFT members queried this in the @Pixelmon discord server and received a reply that ""the assets were used to demonstrate [Pixelmon's] voxel engine."" https://t.co/V9oGlR8rfz"
79,"8/ And clearly, we have seen this already with the reveal. The assets were clearly unfinished, and it certainly seems from the outside looking in that some basic level of quality assurance (read: just checking the damn things) before shipping would have avoided this whole issue. https://t.co/cU72zKd53E"
80,"7/ I have also previously detailed the major risk factor with an investment based on future potential of a project - when things are so far from finished, investors bear the massive risk of any mishaps or fumbles by the dev team along the way to get there. https://t.co/L0CFnsUXbH"
81,"6/ It can certainly be argued that investors are investing in the ""potential"" of the project - but the issue with this is that it is an immense ask to have retail investors lock up 3 ETH for such a long time, in a space which moves this quickly."
82,"5/ But with @Pixelmon, I think the floor price drop is indicative of an issue in a huge fundraise when the product isn't yet finished. Shipping an unfinished product for 3 ETH (US$7,500-9,000 depending on market price) and expecting that price to hold is wishful thinking at best."
83,"4/ Let's talk firstly about the floor price. While I do like keeping up with statistics (including floor price) for projects that I am looking at, I'm usually not a huge fan of harping on about why the floor price on something is low, or calling for the devs to ""do something""."
84,"3/ Perhaps most alarmingly, after the reveal debacle, there was evidence which surfaced suggesting that the Pixelmon team used paid Unity assets as a base to create their voxel models. It then also came out that dev funds were being spent on various NFTs.
https://t.co/bMoq9L5bQI https://t.co/rnvDE6MPSO"
85,"2/ Since mint, the project has run into a number of issues. Notably, the price on secondary tanked, meaning investors instantly lost 40% or more of the value of their investment. The reveal which happened yesterday was also disappointing, to say the least.
https://t.co/eba9CmNOHS https://t.co/PJsKcXqTW3"
86,"1/ In case you are missing any context on the situation: @Pixelmon launched their NFT project off the back of some incredibly hype teasers and a gorgeous game demo.

The mint was done via dutch auction, starting at 3 ETH. The project raised approx US$70m.

https://t.co/8EN82UV6fs"
87,"As a big disclaimer, I understand @syber has been doxxed and is receiving death threats. Some may argue this is justified, but I personally don't think this should ever be condoned.

I am writing this not as an attack, but as a reflection on how we can do better in this space."
88,"Regarding @Pixelmon: Here are some of my thoughts on the situation as a transactions lawyer, framed from the perspective of the mint being a crowdsourced seed round fundraise marketed at retail investors.

I am not personally invested. I will attempt to be impartial.

91,@Warren_RJay @SneakyninjaNFTs @ZAGABOND @shanicucic96 @SneakyninjaNFTs would never do such a thing 👀
92,"@notalexlin @locationtba @Pixelmon It’s ofc difficult to deal with funds already having been raised, but agree that frugality/not buying NFTs is a start. Escrow with periodic release would be another option, and full transparency would help since the funds are effectively crowdsourced."
93,"@notalexlin @locationtba @Pixelmon Great take on the situation. I do think there is something to be said about going out to retail investors with fully fleshed out teasers/marketing for a 3 eth DA when in reality little to nothing has been done. In traditional markets, this would be fraudulent misrepresentation."
