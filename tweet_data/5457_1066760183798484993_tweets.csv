4,@doodles please remember that if you sell your #spacedoodles you sell the original NFT with it! This is not an airdrop. Someone sold their doodle for 5 eth earlier. Don't be that guy/girl!
5,"@notwarrenETH @doodles I don't know if I feel more for the guy who sold it for 5, or for the one who sold it for 7 and then bought it back for 9 (but well done for the purchaser who agreed to give it back, even if with a nice bounty)"
6,@NFTs_girl @ladywagmi 👀
7,@notwarrenETH @doodles good for who bought. I am sorry but in these cases I have little sympathy

20,"I miss when ""flip or hold?"" was my main concern in the day :("
21,"@jaynemesis @MatiGreenspan what about stuff like monero and zcash? shouldn't they be anonymous and privacy oriented?

honestly trying to understand if and how crypto can live in a doomsday scenario"
22,"@MytweetsDave @SecondLife It is! But I don't get why as being like the OG metaverse they haven't tried to move towards blockchain and decentralized economy, while sticking to an old and surpassed model. They have the user base, they have the technology, they have the currency... why not blockchain?"
23,"@jaynemesis @MatiGreenspan Honest question: the nature of Bitcoin and crypto isn't exactly why you should prefer them at this time? Who cares if you can't withdraw it for Ruble anytime soon, as long as the petrol station and the greengrocer accept it via decentralized wallets? Unlikely scenario of course."
24,not anymore. now I want to know who has been the cheeky one :P

34,@collector_chick I discovered a couple days ago that people on Twitter have other non nft pics as profile 👀 shocking
35,@jaynemesis @Kaomsebai I didn’t mean to start a flame sorry. But I imagine the US wouldn’t sit quietly if Russia was talking with Mexico to enter a defensive alliance.
36,@jaynemesis Isn’t this Cuba’s crisis with inverted roles?
37,"@Outsider_Fx_ @CRYPTO_TAG Again this underlies the fact that you need to rely on fiat money. I’m saying that if the people start to use crypto as currency, you would non more need to change it or sell it to fiat. If a car is worth 1 btc you don’t need to know it’s value in fiat anymore. 1 btc is 1 btc"
38,"@Outsider_Fx_ @CRYPTO_TAG If the recipient accepts it because his bank account is frozen too, if the car dealer accepts it, the green grocer accepts it and the tennis teacher accepts it, you don’t need any exchange or custody. That’s what decentralized means. You can’t ban it or block it or stop it."
39,@Outsider_Fx_ @CRYPTO_TAG Exchanges are not the crypto currency if I need to pay for stuff I just send them if fiat money becomes worthless o unusable a decentralized wallet is all you need.
40,@Outsider_Fx_ @CRYPTO_TAG you can't ban BTC that's how decentralized works

55,@Cryptotyrion This is risky
56,@scottmelker make yourself an etoro account and get copiers :P
57,@scottmelker Russia has been accumulating gold for years and likely also cryptocurrencies. How long can they finance themselves is the real question.
58,@OxNukem @scottmelker Not talking sides I’m just drawing a scenario I know the responsibilities of the west upon most of the world.9
59,@scottmelker lots of buy orders triggered on that level?
60,"@OxNukem @scottmelker When China decides to turn on Taiwan or North Korea decides to take over South Korea because they see the world doing nothing, that becomes an Asia problem too."
61,"@scottmelker Same identical pattern of Hitler in 1938-1939...

-&gt; Czechoslovakia - world did nothing

Where are we at now?"
62,"Watching floor prices today, or stock prices or crypto prices is distasteful and selfish. We are blessed if we can still open a Twitter page and write stuff in it pretending our lives are still the same. Is this what living in the Cold War felt like?"

68,@0xValent1n4 But even if you sell breaking even or at loss it’s your decision. Someone came after me on Twitter because I sold something under the floor a couple weeks ago! Just because I needed quick liquidity for a mint and I was in profit anyway 🤷‍♂️
69,@0xValent1n4 Sounds like the dream
70,"@0xValent1n4 I understand the sarcasm, and i think there is good in both approaches. I try to get in projects long term (aka years, not days) but I always have my flips to do as well. Perfectly legit to sell, as to hold. Only reason to sell at loss imho is to buy back cheaper."
71,@LDrahor Timeline never lies 👀
72,606 followers 👀🙏
73,@HollyGShore We need filters for nft pfp now
74,@Mladek_eth Nothing out of your discord and Twitter stream actually happens. Is the metaverse more real than the world outside? 👀
75,"@scottmelker I think most of the FUD has already been taken in by the markets (crypto, stock, nft, bonds, everything).
Also, after 2 years of only up arrows, profit taking kicked in as well pretty much everywhere, mostly from tech related assets.
Some downside still imho, and WWIII of course."
76,@ScottyMac101 mine is more a hope lol
77,@ScottyMac101 aren't we not in it? most stuff down 50% from the highs how big will this bear be?
