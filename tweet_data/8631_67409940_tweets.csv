1,Wonder how much of the Bitcoin pump today is Russia getting out of western banks/swift.
2,@veteranwhite @WSJ @WSJopinion I agree. Inviting World War III isn’t an option and it’s really not our fight at all. The hatred for bullying makes me wanna put troops on the ground but I think we’re going to wisest direction for the world on this.
3,@RealCryptoFace1 haven’t dusted off my Market Cipher skills in a while but pretty sure I’m seeing money flow rounding up and and anchor/trigger wave. #Bullish https://t.co/YlTxzbwzPu
4,@PirateApe @BoredApeYC Looks like OpenSea is the reason for the most part but I do like that site. Good info.
5,@h0ppa @PirateApe @BoredApeYC I can’t tell you what price to buy an ape I just know my eth supply increased significantly when I did and there are plenty of catalysts coming to continue its run.
6,Russia makes some Vodka that comes to the U.S. but I learned that it was only 1.2% and most brands we associate with Russia are made elsewhere. What are the most direct ways we can help protest this war with our wallets?
7,@dabo_eth That’s a better view.
8,Just looking through 5 year periods of the Nasdaq (technology sector). Follow the orange line and it’s parabolic nature recently. What’s your take? Cool-let’s ride? Unhealthy-look out below? TLDR? https://t.co/BBz4d3eP6E

35,@adamchernoff Everything entertainment will be VR. A lot of it’s already in the works. Grab an Oculus if you haven’t.
36,"Wanted to give a shout out to https://t.co/AfNzUFJ7cU. Not only is it super effective to quickly identify nft deals on @opensea, you can also easily sort nfts in whale wallets there to see what your favorite nft buyers are hodling."

42,@cryptobrickz @BoredApeYC Yeah they are definitely doing everything to set this thing up for the long-term.
43,@cryptobrickz @BoredApeYC Tried again. Turns out the delete button works. 🤣
44,@cryptobrickz @BoredApeYC Good point but I hate that thing being in there. Tried to remove it a couple of times but failed. The album pic is the worst too.
45,"RT @BaycStudios: Meeting in The Metaverse: Fan animation ft. two of your favorite APEs, who can't stop talking about NFTs.

46,@DegausserFtW @etienneshrdlu @jimmyfallon You could be right my fren. We are so early in this space anyone that says they know exactly how it will end is wrong. It’s pretty interesting tech when you do some unbiased research though. Good luck on your journey fren.
47,@DegausserFtW @etienneshrdlu @jimmyfallon That’s where you buy nfts (there are other sites by the way) just like you might go to zillow to look at houses or Ameritrade to buy a stock. I was in your shoes for about a week before a friend sent me a cheap nft. Then I bought one for fun. Then I got it.
48,@randomfrankp Welcome a bored @justinbieber!!
49,@DegausserFtW @etienneshrdlu @jimmyfallon Do some homework fren. You don’t have to buy one but at least try and understand before spending so much hate on it. https://t.co/BGJxuD1VIV
50,@DegausserFtW @etienneshrdlu @jimmyfallon Do some homework fren. He can go online and sell his in under a day for over 100 ethereum.
51,@DegausserFtW @etienneshrdlu @jimmyfallon Try and sell yours.
52,@TenaciousEth There’s a lot of sayings about haters being a good thing. If it’s good we are right on track.
53,@stoolpresidente Nice! (Not Neat @AltcoinDailyio ) only better play was sweeping 4 apes. Just saying.

57,@crispylines @BoredApeYC Same. It came too fast.
58,@cryptosamy1 @kchryssafis I’d use your brain to get a decent job. Most of us didn’t get rich on nfts. We got rich then bought nfts.
59,@chadgelina Talent no doubt! How do you move that fast?

69,Same would hold true on the scalping before the show.
70,Since the ticket also becomes a collectible you can gain royalties on the secondary sales of the tickets after the show forever.
71,@WidespreadPanic you guys should start using nft show posters as your tickets. You could then verify attendance with your fans to create early ticket buying opportunities and merch drops based on attendance.
