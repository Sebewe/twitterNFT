2,"@ron1ndoteth @ZAGABOND @doodles Agreed. Also from a collector point of view, they like matching traits. If collectors can mix-and-match to find matching traits across collections (e.g. same chroma or accessories), that drives value for them. More custom pairing options. Still, really cool ships implementation"
3,"@ron1ndoteth @ZAGABOND @doodles I think the idea is to have non-dilutionary tokens. Theoretically the value of the genesis token will increase. In practice, Clonex has proven that cheaper entry points for people priced out does not necessarily decrease the value of the genesis collection."

27,"@ape4007 @AzukiZen That’s a 1/1 right there, blue with spirit hair. Wild bro. No other non-spirits have spirit features. Azuki fam is glad to have you :) yeah Azuki community is one of the best in the NFT space, it’s one if the top reasons I invested so big"
28,"@thekinggully @AnnieFauv @NadavAHollander I’m still waiting to hear what actually happened. The crazy thing is nobody knows, which is scary for the entire NFT community."
29,@0xbellemere @AzukiZen That sucks that this is happening. That is not the Azuki way. Every project that people pour their time and love into deserves to be successful.
30,"@DonFungible @AzukiZen @BernardNakamoto @javitoshi @susuki1220 @0xMakase @anhek_ @NFTdivide @GoshfatherTV @eranthe_eth Bro are you kidding me at 90E? People are buying non-goldens at 100E+. What a pick, congrats!!!! Welcome it's good to have you in the garden"

38,"@JackSitt That one is such a vibe, one of the top spirits by aesthetics in my opinion. Congrats :)"
39,SCAM ALERT @KarafuruNFT got hacked please do not mint guys 🚨🚨🚨
40,"@nairb621 I buy aesthetics, but valued traits can have a big impact on sale price even in spite of rarity."
41,@kartrud_eth @AzukiZen Welcome to the spirit fam :) what a beautiful pickup
42,@ron1ndoteth Sandbox has a lot more opportunity as they’re not tied to Minecraft pushing out new code to support Web 3 implementations.
43,"@ron1ndoteth I don’t get the allure, yeah it definitely seems to have a competent team and solid tokenomics and land implementations, but why would I want to play a wrapped version of Minecraft? Price is pumping but mostly because supply is massively lower than sandbox"
44,Wonderful work done by @xrathore_eth ! I love the details captured in the fan https://t.co/4CvIa8vNI4

58,"@juniverse_nft @discord Discord got a lot of flak for dipping their toes into NFTs. Strangely enough, gamers aren’t sold on NFTs yet, and they’re a big customer base for Discord. Twitter and Meta are verifying PFPs though. Discord will come around soon :)"
59,"We can talk about all the amazing things coming like Merch, Bobu, Airdrops, but what is amazing is not these “roadmap” features, but the Metaverse we build together. With integrity, certainty, and community. GM and see you in the Metaverse fam. IKZ"
60,"Azuki team found us, and inspired us to dream of community governance, brand building, and raw creativity. Azuki challenges us to be better. To stop the tunnel vision on price pumps and start imagining a world where the builders and the community come first."
61,"The Azuki team knew that the NFT community was looking for more. They saw innovators, builders, and trendsetters. These are the people that buy in early to emerging trends like NFTs. We all hope deep down to prove something to the world."
62,"People may ask why this project? What is responsible for its stratospheric rise. The truth is there are many reasons. But what really sets Azuki apart is an ambitious vision, backed by flawless execution and a true connection between a brand and its audience."
63,"Spirit #4666 just sold for a staggering 204e. This historic sale was closed by @Arthur_0x, marking the highest ever sale of an @AzukiZen at almost $600k USD. All this for a collection that launched a month ago. https://t.co/L6h30YURtD"
