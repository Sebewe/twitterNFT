34,3/ This project immortalizes these everyday moments that we take for granted by combining two processes that have led to major advancement in relation to photography and archives: digitizing film and NFTs on the blockchain. 🎞🌐

59,@jeffexcell Feel for you — had a phase where I was rly upset I couldn’t onboard ppl I KNEW would grow well in the space; ppl I thought perfectly aligned themselves w/ core web3 values but couldn’t get past their own poorly researched “knowledge” of the space.

73,@KristynaArcher 💞 It was really well put together. Loved all the references you made in the beginning and questions asked were really thoughtful - allowing for really in-depth conversations to happen.
74,"7/7 this thought brings me back to the final statement in Archer's interview by @miaforrestphoto 

""To silence authentic stories of motherhood is to damage and disconnect from our roots."""
75,"6/7 Think of Dorothea Lange ""Migrant Mother"" -- one of the most iconic images of the great depression. Can the hardship and labour of motherhood not be tied to global events and universal hardships shared by all genders? Are we threatened by the mere raw moments of motherhood? https://t.co/KM6TToiDzD"
76,"5/7 When reflecting on the depictions of mother and child throughout history there seems to be a disconnect to what is praised and what is shamed - why is it that we deem the images by these artists to ""violate"" what is acceptable?"
77,"4/7 Hatten: ""We are not going into communities where we have a structural advantage over them in some way and extracting their stories, we are connecting with our families at home with them.”"
78,3/7 @KristynaArcher raised an excellent question with regards to the ethical challenges in photojournalism vs ethics and censorship in motherhood --  the response is nothing short of being powerful...
79,2/7 Just finished reading an absolutely incredible interview done by @KristynaArcher w/ @miaforrestphoto @lilycallisto  and @amy___woodward  regarding the pain and conflict of motherhood gaze censorship in photography.
80,"“our work is not the not the problem here, our children are not the problem, our photographs are not the problem. If they aren’t safe in our photos, they are not safe anywhere, they're not safe in real life and we are not the ones that are making them unsafe.” TRUTH 💣 https://t.co/BOOxtcasg1"

82,@louisiruela @fellowshiptrust This is amazing!! I've only known combination printing made in this era from photographers like Henry Peach Robinson and Oscar Rejlander - both who used it for narrative tableaus. Interesting to see Sander use this technique for advertising.
