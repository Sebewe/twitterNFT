9,"@Scamart_0v0 Your right, I would say exactly that but they blocked me 😂 Artificially trying to pump a floor is too common these days."
10,The creator of an #NFT project messages me saying I destroyed his project because I listed #NFTs on the floor.... I was holding for 6 months and wanted some of my losses back. I didn't do or say anything about your #NFTCollection. https://t.co/wTHa5hoJ7G
11,These registrations are the HNS community betting on SLD's future. When $HNS SLDs are completely decentralized because of @Namecheap they will be just as sought after as a TLD because of how many quality domains will be available. https://t.co/MdbQK7F4wt

28,"Some of my favorite ENS Names I own
UHG.eth (United Health Group #8 highest MC in world)

29,"ENS domains are more profitable than Unstoppable Domains for one reason. UD has corporate trademarks reserved for companies. If a company wants name.nft they just claim it, but if they want name.eth they have to pay a premium on secondary."
30,0xApes are the Phunks of BAYC. So much so that 0X is now the Phunks of everything else.
