3,RT @sadgirlautumnx: Hey @opensea I think it's time you verified @CryptoMories
4,@CryptoMories lol still not verified though.
5,Let's go #famorie fam. This just strengthens the collection in a way that other #nft projects haven't. They have been tested and made it through the storm. https://t.co/1oCiWWrh9j

10,@BobbyBananasNFT NFT passive income is a farce.
11,@DiscoverXnft 3ETH in no time. Maybe today.
12,@AshleyDCan I see that as well. A very small portion - maybe 2 out of 100 don't dip.
13,@TypicalFish_NFT besides twitter*
14,"best sources for #NFT news? 

go!"
15,lol this is the best F you I've seen in years. https://t.co/azmrgHDlas
16,"@itsdanataylor Respectfully, hoodie and joggers is a bad comparison. 

The equivalent for a guy dressing the same way would be low-cut, tight-fitting booty shorts with a defined d*ck imprint. 

Folks would recoil instantly to a man wearing that in a business setting."
17,@azuma_eth awesome combo

19,@JeanSchlemaan @burgandySean @Karnage420x @selectedwisdom I imagine russian air strikes took out a lot of the power and communication networks.
20,"@GoTrillaGorilla I saw Mfers drop to 2ETH and was shocked. So I grabbed one immediately, not realizing it was because of war breakout news. 

Purely luck."

27,@cryptoein Silver is a dead investment.
28,@ApeStackin @RealSupDucks Also utility is mostly vaporous anyway. The only useful utility is that which generates money. Anything else is noise.
29,@ApeStackin @RealSupDucks Mfers are starting to reach Veblen good status while supducks are not at the moment.

37,@CrypdohBot @SoapBoxCar If you go into your NFT stash on the left hand column are the collections you own. There is an organg flag  next to each collection that doesn't meet the requirements.
38,"Pro tip. Don't get attached to your jpegs. 

Be practical with your profits. 

If an #NFT represents a good chunk of networth for you. Sell it and move on.

Note to self."
39,@domenserg @KosherPlug nice!

44,"@lynn_jennfer Well done, and keep going! Great accomplishment."
45,@dougboneparth this is actually really cool
46,"Here's what I mean in regards to the @themetroverse #NFT.

A large portion of new investors end up grabbing 4-5 Metroverse because boosts compound passive token yield.

It makes sense to invest in 3-4 instead of just 1.

Go through the activity and you'll see what I mean. https://t.co/Q89DhNaTp9"
47,"RT @crypto__kermit: NFT Token Yield Rankings🏆:

48,"The great thing about @themetroverse #nft is that you can never buy just 1.

The collectability attribute is off the charts.

I own 5.

91,@stellabelle In the US you can write your mortgage interest payments off to reduce your taxes. disclaimer: Not accounting advice.
92,"@stellabelle Going further from an opposite analogy.

Let's say your house costs 100k.

Yearly inflation is 7%.

Your house will closely appreciate at that rate, so at the end of the year you now have a house worth roughly $107K.

But you only paid 4K in interest which you can write off."
93,"@stellabelle ""gone down"" in quotes. The number is still 100K you owe, but 100K is now only 93K in purchasing power this year compared to last."
94,"@stellabelle So while you paid out 4K at the EOY, your initial loan balance has essentially gone down because the purchasing power of 100K has decreased 7%."
95,"@stellabelle Yes - let's say you bought your house last year for 100k at a 4% interest rate. You paid 4K in interest at the end of the year. You can write that off. 

But if inflation is 7%, the 100k you owe basically has become less because the purchasing power of 100k has gone down 7%."
96,"@0x_fxnction bought a bunch between 2,200-2,600"
97,"@stellabelle Not sure if you are USA or not, but currently my mortgage rate is 4.3%. Inflation rate is 7%. I'll keep the mortgage - free money."
