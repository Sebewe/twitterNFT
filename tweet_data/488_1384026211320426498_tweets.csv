14,@NFT_Only @dheavyside @nftworldsNFT Yeah refer to the original tweet. Unless I'm understanding that wrongly?
15,@dheavyside @NFT_Only @nftworldsNFT I’m interested in getting in on this but the only concern is isn’t advertising not allowed based on Minecraft’s EULA agreement? I’ve been trying to find answers around this but it still seems like it’s not allowed?
16,@StellaCat4 @GGboi_22 @GiancarloChaux I tried searching before and again today. A bunch of people talked about selling advertising and some questions about it (seems like advertising is not allowed). The team can't control what people build and some will definitely put up billboards which may put the project at risk.
17,@GGboi_22 @StellaCat4 @GiancarloChaux Genuine question: What happens if some owners decide to charge other companies money to put up billboards / advertising which contravenes the EULA agreement? It's inevitable that some owners will try to do this (some already talk about it). I think most don't know about EULA.
18,"5/ In this web3 space dominated by text-based conversations, it is often difficult to read emotions. It is a reminder for us to acknowledge possible misunderstandings, which could be amplified by cultural differences. Nuances of words can change based on our personal experiences."
19,"4/ He was ""right"" in a logical sense but he had failed to convince the team to take action on it, possibly because his ego lead to his constant insistence on being right. But other people were turned off by this behavior and could not take him seriously."
20,"3/ He wasn't taken seriously back then and possibly felt aggrieved to take action against The DAO, by exploiting the vulnerabilities to net himself millions of dollars worth of crypto."
21,"2/ An Austrian software developer was allegedly revealed to be the hacker behind the 2016 The DAO hack. Before the hack he had tried to warn the team about security vulnerabilities but his communication was ""obnoxious (and) was quite insistent on having found a lot of problems."""
22,"1/ Fascinating story on the alleged hacker behind The DAO hack in 2016. I think this highlights the importance of cultivating emotional intelligence in a space full of talented and smart people. One may be ""right"" in logic but without consensus, situations cannot be made ""right"". https://t.co/wdv8VycLAD"
23,Two of our core Indonesian community members will be speaking here in Bahasa. Klo org Indo Kamis bergabung dengan Spaces ini ya. https://t.co/Gk6Cu2MNVL
24,"@indigo03 You are right. But scarce land has value because it is self selective (through capital) to have the greatest likelihood to create content of value. Again, doesn’t mean that abundant land has no value but the value is more in self-expression of the creator."
25,@nft_and_coffee Very good point. Scarce land helps to concentrate attention on a smaller area so it’s more likely to create or foster social experiences in a way that is meaningful. Otherwise you might as well create a console game or an app.
26,@indigo03 There will be platforms providing unlimited land to give people a place to express their creativity and private events. And there is value in scarce land due to the benefit of “curated” content (people who bought expensive land will more likely create content of value).
27,"4/ Metaverse land can be infinite in theory, but people's attention is objectively scarce. You can build on infinite amounts of land but if no one visits it (or stops visiting after the initial novelty), are there other values beyond that of self-expression? Scarcity has value."
28,3/ The ability of NFTs to attract constant attention from the public is arguably one of the biggest contributors to NFT price. Projects that constantly execute and try to create value for holders may not necessary hold their value over time (especially with poor marketing).
29,"2/ Biggest benefit of NFTs is to scale up communities rapidly to tap into strong network effects to collectively contribute to value growth, although other benefits like easier fundraising and greater market access for artists are also noteworthy benefits."
30,"1/ Some shower thoughts on the following questions.

What's the biggest benefit of launching NFTs?
What's the biggest contributor to NFT price?
Should metaverse lands be scarce? 

These are my thoughts, summarized. If there are other opinions, I welcome people to challenge them."
31,@danielgothits Yeah just stay safe. Better not get into fights on Twitter.
32,"@danielgothits Yeah indeed it has caught on especially in Chinese circles. I'm not seeing much outside of Chinese communities in Asia yet though, but let's see how it develops."
33,"RT @Nesotual: Seen confusion about the OS thing so.

34,"RT @dfinzer: I know you’re all worried. We’re running an all hands on deck investigation, but I want to take a minute to share the facts as…"
35,@JungleGoat Language and cultural experience is my unique advantage in this space
36,"It’s extremely hard to build language-based communities. You can open a channel for specific languages but without managing it closely, it often devolves into everyone just saying “hi” or “gm” or other conversations without substance. https://t.co/pGBUt0wfT9"
37,"@muzkmuzkmuzk Why not throw an event in @asiaverseworld ? Check the recent tweets. You’re a musician, we can easily showcase talented musicians in the metaverse to a global audience. Why restrict to Hawaii? But let’s do Hawaii too in future just for fun. Miss the sun and waves."
38,@NFT_Clydesdale 가즈아
39,@NFT_Clydesdale Thank you! Come and hang out with the Korean gang now! Many new people but they are starting to know each other.
40,"I’m so happy that after many months of trying to build a Korean community, it’s starting to come together. I remember going into Korean channels and people there ignoring me all the time. We have now built six dynamic communities in Asia based on different languages!"
41,@HappyCow1234 Personally I don't share the same opinion. If the team is new to NFTs or just want to focus on art they can always start with a much smaller collection to experiment. Otherwise a lot of people's investment is at stake. I say this after seeing a lot of such projects underperform.
42,@HappyCow1234 I take your point. But what if its no roadmap and don't plan to figure out. Main point is to sell 10K art pieces?
43,"What's up with recent NFT projects that have no roadmap or even any plan? It makes me think that the founders either don't know about the benefits of NFTs to accelerate community building efforts, or they just can't be bothered. And yet they keep selling out."

74,2/ Suddenly someone DM me that one is listed at 2 ETH. Of course I went to buy it to try to flip it but naturally someone else immediately fulfilled the 0.1 ETH listing and I lost the NFT. When I realized in horror that I fell for the exploit I woke up. Be careful of this method!
75,1/ I was taking a nap when I dreamed that I fell for the OpenSea exploit. The situation is that I moved an ERC 1155 NFT to another wallet without cancelling the listing (0.1 ETH). I forgot about it and some time later it went up to 3 ETH floor.
