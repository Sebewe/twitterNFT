35,@jaearesnfts @InvsbleFriends Best advice i can start out with is to learn how to revoke access too smart contracts as if signing a bad one you could end up losing nfts &amp; do not sell nfts that were airdropped too you for free as that could cause signing a bad smart contract. Always be weary of scams.
