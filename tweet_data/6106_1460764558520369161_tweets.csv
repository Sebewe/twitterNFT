1,@DeItaone This is a pleasant surprise
2,"@biancoresearch @long_solitude @ddittman You framed it as Russian oligarchs being better off today than they were yesterday, when all they got was a rebound from extremely deflated prices"
3,@DeItaone Feel like I’ve seen this tweet every day for a year now lol
4,@stevekmd1 @DeItaone Obsessed much?
5,@DeItaone After the market close obviously…
6,"@BTC_Archive Nice, now Russia will back off!"
7,@DeItaone If they could just buy crypto instead that would be cool thanks
8,@DeItaone Just because they can’t day trade stocks anymore
9,"#Bitcoin exchange balance is about to break 2.5 million for the first time since November 2018... 

Get yours while supplies last 👀 https://t.co/2Dr46koOIz"
10,@DeItaone What’s this hidden gem he’s talking about?
11,"Excited for the comeback that, at one point, I didn't think was possible... $WGMI"
12,"@Jacobs84062658 @CNBC They’re two ranges. Originally estimate: $4.4-4.8bn. 

New estimate: $3.7bn-3.8bn"
13,@JACStradnShack They should have never hired this many people in the first place. Poor demand forecasting led to excessive bloat and unsustainable costs. But they should maintain their employee base out of solidarity until they have to file for bankruptcy?
14,@JACStradnShack Because they’re losing money hand over fist and can’t afford to keep those employees. $400-500m quarterly loss expected to be announced today…
15,@DeItaone BULLISH
16,"@ThePortugueseI2 Seems like a short squeeze, catalyst being BTC pump."
17,"@InveLimit @DeItaone Mark to market on the way down but not on the way up? You’re right, not outdated - they never made sense to begin with"
18,"@DocumentingBTC @elonmusk No, it would still be worth $1.5 billion…"
19,@DeItaone Outdated accounting principles
20,@jw_invest5 @Ehrls15 @investvoyager It 100% moves the needle. Most buyers don’t use OTC or Canadian exchanges so I don’t see why he said that.
21,"Am I the only one who thinks this can only be bad for the NFT community?

Why raise outside capital and direct that value away from community members? @BoredApeYC https://t.co/VkzjjWAWyt"

25,"Bought my first NFT on the Solana chain, s/o to @samoyedcoin for this cool pup https://t.co/SjtEr300KF"
26,@DeItaone Where the bears at 🥱

28,"Can an on-chain whiz explain to me how these two charts aren't contradicting each other? Pic 1: Bitcoin exchanges have net outflows. Pic 2: Bitcoin exchange balance increasing during that same period.

29,Don’t take it personally if I don’t follow you back 😢 https://t.co/h5s1PSPIib

31,"Just bought another @fishyfamNFT on @LooksRareNFT. I think I’m addicted. 

Say gm to this little guy. https://t.co/7nhmIE9tOn"
32,@fishyfamNFT Gm
33,RT @bizserk: We are a amazing NFT project who has and will continue to donate a portion of all the sales to helping save the Ocean. Please…
34,@RamiroMenne @ZeroFeeYacht @OGDfarmer @opensea I have the same question - if it’s non custodial there’s no way that OS can prevent you from transferring. Did you find an answer to this?
35,"I’ve been staking $LOOKS for a while but now I’ve finally done a transaction on @LooksRareNFT and damn it felt good! 

Looking forward to the trading rewards from getting this little guy @fishyfamNFT https://t.co/cu4tVtTzIn"
36,@MarketRebels LOL
37,@charliebilello @ycharts The crazy part is this includes their outsized gains from $TSLA.
38,@BeltwayGreg @hblodget Wow what an incredibly unique and genius call to make 🤯
39,@LooksRareNFT Gm
40,@litcapital Heard this story a million times 💤
41,Alright enough I need $100k #Bitcoin NOW.
42,@StockMKTNewz @keylargofoley give them a call
43,@CNBCnow Dear lord thank you. I promise to stop using leverage. Thanks again.
44,@MarketRebels I got rekd
45,"@mprau88 @Randy070707 @PeterPanhehimh1 @p_ferragu By your logic if they issued more debt, end change in cash would be higher. Same if they issued shares. 

FYI, operating cash and free cash flow are positives. The reason total cash flow is negative is because they’re prepaying their debt. That’s not a bad thing."
46,"Heavily long $STEM today. Best stock entry I’ve had in a while. 

Definitely oversold. Earnings February 8th. Let’s get it."
47,@wenweb4 @fishyfamNFT https://t.co/Thpk1aSGVL
48,"@elonmusk @bespokeinvest @POTUS Presidential gaslighting, but like really poorly done"
49,Down 50% on my $VYGVF investment. Can someone do something?
50,@fishyfamNFT Lfg
51,What’s up @fishyfamNFT 👀
52,@DeItaone https://t.co/jcWYwPkocX
53,@moodgooru @scootdart @WClementeIII Except for the fact that stability is literally part of their mandate
54,@scootdart @WClementeIII It creates uncertainty and uneasiness which isn’t good for stability
55,@DeItaone I don’t get it. Are they banning it or soliciting investment? Or both lol?
56,@grimacecoineth @McDonalds @Tesla @McDonalds Ray Kroc would have wanted this.
57,@MarketRebels I’m a #Bitcoin bull but this analysis makes me second guess myself
58,@DeItaone Futures traders keep FUDding
59,"@elonmusk @DeItaone @McDonalds Didn’t pump that much, you’re losing power. You must up the ante."
60,"@LooksRareNFT You don’t want your users auto selling their NFTs at 90% below market value? Wdym? 

@opensea lol"
61,"The bottom is in #Bitcoin 

(No reasoning whatsoever)"
62,@_dmda_ @PeterCoinPan (Past 24 hours)
63,@_dmda_ @PeterCoinPan Lack of users is my primary concern https://t.co/dHU0fV4eSq
64,@galaxyBTC Power transfers to the strong
65,@MarketRebels Don’t worry I have a long term (10 year) price target at $21
66,"@searthur2200 @SquawkCNBC @GordonJohnson19 I don’t think anyone, let alone hedge funds, trade based on his opinion."
67,@SquawkCNBC @GordonJohnson19 Do they keep bringing this guy on so we can dunk on him?
68,@ItsMe_Randy @RL00xx Just stake and chill
69,Can’t say this is a surprise. $PTON https://t.co/tYpza1IYJ6 https://t.co/OqBz5gjqkB
70,RT @LooksRareNFT: Has anyone called Vitalik yet?
71,@crypto_bitlord7 Okay but this time it’s actually the bottom
72,@DeItaone He took “fuck you money” literally
73,@DeItaone Great timing
74,@investvoyager Ok cool now buy your shares back
75,@mohitmadaan @LooksRareNFT Why do people keep doing this?
76,"John Foley might be the poster boy for corporate mismanagement. 

@onepeloton would be a lot better off without him. That said, I’m buying at these prices 😳"
77,@sannSD @LooksRareNFT https://t.co/OvmTuUBva9
78,"@Chris_Gillespie @LooksRareNFT 34,200 $LOOKS and counting"
79,"1.02 WETH ($3175) payout from staking my $LOOKS today. Wow.

Thank you @LooksRareNFT 🙏🏽"
80,"@MongooseCoinDev Shameless rug. Prove legitimacy by itemizing all expenses, accounting for all $9m+"
81,"At this stage they have lost any and all credibility and it’s clear as day that they’re scammers. I’m not suggesting that anyone goes to V2 (I personally won't), only that you stop trading on V1. Stop pumping the scammers’ bags."
82,That spokesman tried to rectify this glaring lie by stating that the figure actually stands at $6.3 million. How would someone integral to the project (and who now claims he’s leading the marketing efforts) not know how much funds were available? At 5:15 https://t.co/y0msANVnKK
83,"In reality, they’re pumping their bags through a royalty that’s disguised as a marketing tax. While the marketing wallet should have over $9 million, they initially claimed to only have $3 million, at 7:35 of YouTube video linked.
https://t.co/CRRb5dQb2Q"
84,"As we all know, very few funds have been expensed towards actual marketing so far, so the wallet should still have close to that amount. The marketing team has stated multiple times that they’re holding off on using the funds in order to “grow organically.”"
85,"From the onset, the tokenomics of the token directed 6% of all volume towards marketing. Per Dextools, the Mongoose-ETH pair has done over $154 million in volume, which implies that the marketing wallet should have generated over $9.2 million (6%) to date."
86,"To everyone who still believes in V1 of $MONG and stands by the original dev, you’re being gradually rugged and I have proof. 

A thread:"
87,@DeItaone English please?
88,@evantan Right behind you at 58 ETH worth!
89,@LooksRareNFT So ur saying load my bags up more
90,"@DeItaone Yeah let the insider traders self regulate, because they totally will."
91,@davebrevere @DoxedBoyDev He’s a rugger beware
92,@RexInuOfficial Mindlessly aped into this right now
93,@RexInuOfficial can you release tokenomics details?
94,"To everyone buying the $MONG dip, stop. The contract has been renounced and you’re continuing to feed the Dev’s marketing wallet. 

There is no community takeover, at least not on this contract. 

@mongoosecoineth"
95,@crypto_bitlord7 it would still be a problem as we were all told that the contract was renounced since inception
96,"@Smatt01319194 i haven’t been following up since i sold out, but it looks like the devs dipped with the marketing wallet. me and another mod discussing it around a month ago: https://t.co/zOtf5bNsdl"
97,"sorry to my $mong fam. i had some suspicions but didn’t want to FUD anyone’s bags when i was modding the discord, so i left quietly. i guess that was a mistake."
98,@LooksRareNFT wen sorting?
