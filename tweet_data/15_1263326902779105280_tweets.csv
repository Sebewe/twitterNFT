5,@allthatwecarry @Eclipsecoffeeca @PeteOHaraPhoto Did you replace something else with it?
6,@ryanadrift @Eclipsecoffeeca @PeteOHaraPhoto They must rotate with fresh roasts. I surely didn't go pick it up although I wish I did!
7,@jaimedelpizz0 @Eclipsecoffeeca @PeteOHaraPhoto (You should still def try the roaster if this lighter roast is any indication)
