1,What projects are the web3 moonshots?
2,"web3 is so amazing yet much of it is so cringe. I think I think that because I was all those people less than 6 months ago and realized that all the hype is fun for awhile, but unsustainable even just in terms of your own attention.

Better to find smthg meaningful &amp; go for it."
3,@shiraeis Uh hell yeah.
4,@cobie lmao weaponized influence
5,A major government straight up arming their civilians who've never even shot a gun before is so intensely never something I thought I'd ever see.
6,"Are there any types of ""good"" types of cyber attacks?

Like identifying all political organizers an authoritarian govt is afraid of and crowdfunding them all a ""ConstitutionDAO"" worth of money along with instructions on how to hide it from the govt."
7,This will likely wind up being the most recorded invasion ever. Some deeply terrifying combat footage is probably already on the TL.
8,"""Every little thing is gonna be alright"" by Bob Marley is stuck in my head after hearing it in a commercial.

Having that stuck in my head while watching news of this invasion is just clearly my psyche going into denial, right?"
9,@twobitidiot Fuck
10,Why do we live in a system where one fucking dude can just up and decide to make the entire world stand still.
11,Is staking an NFT a... security feature? Is it possible to steal an NFT from someone OS phishing style if that NFT is staked and thus not actually in the compromised wallet?
12,"if this Russia thing gets even worse, you're going to have wanted to have taken your wallet and basic cyber security seriously."
13,@Psymbol3 lol very true
14,"Wait has Russia been implanting and socially engineering neo-nazism into countries for years just so they could use it as an excuse to go into a country and ""rid them of nazis""?"
15,@MasterTimBlais This is honestly the thing that fucks me up most about VR
16,"Nothing like a bunch of white dude Karens in the replies of a SaaS company virtue signaling by saying ""Extremely disappointing, I  WILL be reviewing my subscription CAREFULLY""

Like lmao no you won't, you're lazy like the rest of us. Just want something to complain about."
17,@MOOMANiBE @1Password @phantom @solana What will you do when they inevitably all have integrations like this? Go back to life without a password manager like some kind of barbarian?

19,"People get weird about how tokens ""hyper-financialze"" even though they're literally obsessed with tracking air miles, hotel points, and credit card rewards points."
20,"Someone, somewhere in the future will have their 22nd birthday at exactly 22:22 on 2/22/2222 and to that person, if you are reading this out of some morbid curiosity of the past I just want to say -- happy birthday!"
21,"It's 2's day, gm all"
22,Is democracy just a large scale DAO vs DAO game?
23,"@itstimconnors Been thinking about DAO vs DAO as an interesting concept for awhile, but this is the first legit implementation I've seen. Great work!"
24,OK this is extremely cool https://t.co/0hqOCpZENX
25,Is there a whole niche music industry of people who make songs that sound extremely similar to old popular commercial songs that they can then license for far cheaper to ad agencies/commercial producers?
26,"@shiraeis Have you read Seveneves? It explores a similar scenario and the ""orbiting in space"" option in extreme detail."
27,"@shiraeis Like a generation ship scenario, or trying to give Mars a go?"
28,Me when both twitter and reddit take more than 10 seconds to load https://t.co/vrOB9vEmF2
29,"Why does everyone with absolutely awful takes on crypto spell it ""Etherium""?"
30,@0x_fxnction Them degods tho
31,Got a new hardware wallet. What do you guys think? https://t.co/XoBNboIRAt
32,@bryanbrinkman @Greekdx Westworld? I'm in.
33,Searching for a new career is kind of like searching for a new thing that interests you enough to get radicalized opinions about.
34,A web3 DnD livestream show where every time a nat20 is rolled everyone watching gets 100 coins.
35,"I don't think small sleek form factor is the right way to go for hardware wallets.

They should be the size and weight of a refrigerator and maybe double as a literal safe. Really drive home the point that self custody is important."
36,"Wondering about if it's possible to track instances of specific opinions on reddit, including frequency of times that opinion is expressed, and where. Eventually being able to track back to where an opinion originated, took root, and spread."
37,"Like ""oh shit, sorry bro I didn't mean to steal YOUR apes. Here, have 5 of them back. Here's 50E as an apology."""
38,"Crypto opens up some extremely interesting dynamics like hackers choosing to give back portions of what they stole to specific people they stole from.

The ease of transacting exactly how and when you decide makes this extremely easy to do even while actively exploiting."
39,Imagine being at a party full of nerds but not really knowing anything about crypto or NFTs and then all of a sudden you see a mass exodus of all the nerds leaving the party checking phones and freaking out for some inexplicable reason.
40,Metaverses are just the information bubbles you're in.
41,The real blockchain social graph is going to just be everyone's tracking of wallets which they monitor specifically to avoid the things that wallet invests in.
42,"@ppcbz 1000% agree. It's insane reading comments from people saying ""they deserve it"" or ""it's fine I've got nothing to hide""...like, it's just not about that."
43,"@drewcoffman Maybe these people don't even actually hate NFTs, but instead just *really* love having the opportunity to virtue signal by posting memes in the replies."
44,A DAO where every decision is determined by the outcome of a chess match.
45,"@jemgold_ @js_horne @balajis @dwr We really do need a phrase for ""connect the specific parts of your digital identity which are tied to this string of numbers and letters""

Wallet addresses are more like blockchain profiles now."
46,*before you even get the chance to talk to someone
47,"It's kinda crazy that in the process of buying something like a home service, you could potentially go through 2-3+ different auctions before you even talk to somebody.

- Google ads auction
- Leadgen site auctions your data to high bidder
- Bidder who buys may run own auction"
48,"The worst part about millennials/humans is that we want every newly proposed solution to be absolutely perfect.

It takes being on the other side of a solution to see that solving a portion of the problem now is better than never solving it, but always complaining about it."
49,"@web3rambo Agreed. But that feels...dangerous, kind of? Like taking the fun out of it or taking yourself too seriously for some creators. But also definitely see that mentality working well for many others."
50,"@web3rambo This is interesting. Honestly feels like a lot of responsibility to take on as a creator. Especially creators early in their careers.

Responsibility as in when creating &amp; selling something you're taking on the burden of people potentially looking to you for their financial gain."
51,"People who *want* the ""Second Life"" feel might wind up actually wanting to use them."
52,"""Bank joins the metaverse, opens location"" sounds like a ridiculous headline at first but it actually...kind of isn't?"
53,"@Cosmic_ape1 @iamDCinvestor Almost my entire IRL friend group has gone from mostly indifferent to ""cryptobros are weirdo scammers and I resent the implication that crypto is even important""...all in a span of like 8 months.

It's mostly them conforming to recent ""extremely online progressive"" opinions imo."
54,@mikedemarais in web3 D&amp;D stands for Dweebs &amp; Delinquents
55,"BattleBots sports anime.

That's it, that's the tweet."
56,"@cleoabram @alexisohanian This was so good! Clear, consise, but also explains the details thoughtfully. Awesome job."
57,"RT @cleoabram: ""Why can't I just screenshot an NFT?""

This isn't a thread about how the blockchain works. It's about art, and the mind-bend…"
58,"@MidCapNFT Agreed. I'm always torn by now much I want the space to grow, and how not really ready for growth it is."
59,"It's not just crypto, either. These dynamics play out in startups too, but to a lesser extent."
60,"Crypto scams exist because crypto itself isn't mature enough. It's still relatively easy to get your hands on large amounts. In that environment scams thrive. As crypto adoption increases, scams increase, then fade as it becomes more difficult to acquire larger amounts."
61,"""could they not just..."" is one of the most intellectually lazy ways of thinking yet also one of the most common formats on twitter"
62,"imo a lot of the crazy swings we see in crypto are really just spikes in excitement about a project and excitement dwindling/sustaining over time.

If regular startups had shares available to the public from day 1 of their launch we'd see similar volatility in those shares."
63,"@adamscochran I wonder if a system could work where your staking rewards are locked and only unlock if you vote in XX% of proposals over a pre-specified timeframe.

Could potentially encourage ppl voting who don't really care, but that can already happen anyway."
64,"Everyone is like ""if cryptocurrency is money then why does it need ads? USD doesn't have ads. Checkmate.""

Reality is crypto ads were for exchanges, not specific currencies. Just like Fidelity, Schwab, RH, Etoro all have ads."
65,@hexagonxyz @metavatar_app definitelysomething.eth
66,"RT @twobitidiot: Difference between https://t.co/n42OWLxYAY ads and crypto ads in the Super Bowl:

67,"@mdudas Don't know if their brand marketing teams are just idiots or if they just dgaf, or both."
68,These peacock commercials made me want a Fast &amp; Furious x Jurassic World crossover.
69,"@SahilBloom Yep, 100%"
70,"Football games in September: FLAG, HOLDING, PASS INTERFERENCE

Super Bowl: no flags ever

Maybe we should just...let teams play through the whole season?"
71,@nlw @FTX_Official Great ad
72,Holy shit that Larry David FTX commercial was based
73,"If I was Coinbase I would've made sure our site crashed after that ad so we'd be able to say ""oh wow the ad was so successful it crashed the site!"""
74,@sweatystartup Now this is top tier engagement farming
75,Super Bowl LVI https://t.co/Dscgv3hqDk
76,@andy8052 The Leftovers was so good! Hard to find people who really enjoyed that show.
77,"If the box scores are 3,3 at halftime I think the universe is trying to tell us something."
78,Imagine Coinbase launches their NFT marketplace with a superbowl ad.
79,"@0xAllen_ If BAYC wants to become a big brand, apes need to be OK with people wearing BAYC merch for the brand without calling them posers imo."
80,"@0xAllen_ This got me thinking, maybe they should fractionalize a single ape and tie tokens to merch, so any time a hoodie is purchased, they're actually also purchasing like 1/100,000th of an ape as well."
81,"@th_graeeb_07 @CoinersTakingLs No one actually says any of those things, except that NFTs are the future and yes banks are indeed bad. Are you really out here being an apologist for banks?"
82,"@chriscantino Tomorrow is going to be insufferable with ""I can't believe these cryptobro psychos are promoting a SCAM during the SUPERBOWL"""
83,@CoinersTakingLs Damn this is like buying a ton of skins in a game and then the game gets shut down.
84,@Alenonimo @p0008874 @CoinersTakingLs Kinda weird that you're writing speculative fiction about another person's money.
85,The Olympics are kind of amazing. It's crazy that every 2 years we just get a global display of the extremes the human body is capable of.
86,Curling needs miniature golf style obstacles
87,"$LOOKS won't ever go to zero because people love tweeting ""$LOOKS like..."" memes too much"
88,"1. make an NFT pre-programmed to change it's image to a new one every day

2. make that NFT your hexagon pfp

Boom, new pfp every single day."
89,"@ComplicatedIsOK @FrankieIsLost Essentially applying additional info to txns. If you know a wallet minted X &amp; Y NFT they might be likely to buy Z.

Public txns &amp; on chain actions are a dream for future marketers. If you think companies can create a profile on you rn, imagine how they'll be able to pinpoint soon"
90,@FrankieIsLost Whoever can categorize public blockchain data first with a relatively high degree of accuracy wins.
91,@LynAldenContact Honestly whatever place has the least amount of mosquitoes has my vote

93,Adidas new brand identity: NFTs and boobs
94,"The phrase ""dry run"" implies the existence of a ""wet run"". Wtf is a wet run?"

98,ok hear me out - fidenza art style but all the lines are spaghetti
99,"@anthsydney @barnabicue @Picolas_Caged @HenryTheBlasian @justinkan @Twitch Tbh interoperability like that is a fantasy for big games. It'll happen is some limited form but it'll take huge effort to make it real in big games. Totally fair game for smaller indie games though and experiences though, especially passion projects."
