38,"@LoganOP_gm Of course, this all fails to address the elephant in the room. How do you quantify the college experience? Most people lack certainty in field of study when they apply. They want to live on their own, or play sports, cheer sports, join a Greek org, student govt."
39,@LoganOP_gm Have tackled this same question before. I think to provide a compelling argument you need strong alternatives. Trade schools are a great option. It/vs certificates can also be pursued through self study or classes/an associate's degree from a local community college.
