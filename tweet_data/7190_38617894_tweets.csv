1,"@OBSRATEGALOSE @ZssBecker Competent, not industry level. The point is we all know skills are actually learned on the job. Basic foundations can be learned cheaply. Then we get the real education in entry level positions. Why pay $100k or more for college when we still need to learn the job anyways"

3,@playlostark My daughter wants to join the server I am playing on since the headstart but it is locked. Will she be able to join me in the future or can we never play together?
4,@The_Lazy_Peon @counter_econ Yeah Id say about an hour of entry level “learn how the combat and skill tree works” quests. Then give us the end game with lots of pregression options we can change every week or whatever.

10,"@JasonPlaysItAll Is she Sicilian? If yes, is she connected?"
11,@verses_crypto @FantohmDAO This. Until the government offers the same protections and insurance for crypto that they do for stocks or fiat then they should not tax it at all until cashed in for fiat.

53,@feeswtf Wish I could get back my donation.
54,@feeswtf Good job charging for your “airdrop”. This is where you take the money and shut down. Rugpull complete.
55,@SwishFrame True. Personally I am rooting for looksrare even though I didn’t qualify for the airdrop. Their model is pro community
56,"@SwishFrame 5 years from now is probably a marketplace that doesn't exist today. Google, Meta, Apple one of those will take the crown most likely."
57,@GuyReyes81 @NTMole @elliotrades Yep its a cash grab. The is the only way they make money. If they wanted a real business they wouldn’t limit the number of customers. They will just keep releasing limited mints to the same group till the money runs out.
58,@buller_rik @NTMole @elliotrades Exactly what kind of game only has a couple hundred players? Exclusive access makes no sense when you need customers. They are just making their marketing team pay to be a part of the team. Only way to make money is to shill  after mint
59,@UncleSPAC That my daughter’s b-day. Gonna be a good day.
60,@FantohmDAO That was a little scary since I am used to seeing a bigger number each time. But 9 out of 10 days is better than most!
61,@jf_nft You got this!
