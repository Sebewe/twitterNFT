69,Doubled bonusly points for team to acknowledge each other more in a remote environment
70,In the end humans need connection for intellectual stimulations. The hybrid approach may create gaps and the mindset remote-first makes hybrid more enjoyable.
71,"We still get together in person at office and do offsite but operating  as a fully remote has its advantages to tools, systems, processes, communication, etc."
72,More communication is written down because consumption is across the time zones.
73,Embedding DEI as foundation in a remote first environment beyond physical spaces
74,Standardized slack channels and organized freelancers into multi channel guests for consistency.

81,Luckily we discussed what we could do. Following many ODS companies we decided to bootstrap fully as remote company despite a few come together to office.
82,"The space helps as a common means to fulfill the need of in person conversations. 4-6 consistently showed up. This while strengthened some areas, relationships with this who were remote stayed flat as those coffee talks were not happening."
