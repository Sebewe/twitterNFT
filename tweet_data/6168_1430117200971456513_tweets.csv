49,"Every NFT derivative that just catches onto the hype says shit like:
 
‘The difference between us other derivatives is that people are just looking to flip those to make money’
 
Nope. You’re getting flipped and you’re not going to recover once the novelty dies off."
50,"Maybe I’m just starting to accept that outside of an extremely bullish market, you’re going to get most long term value long term in buying proven projects when they’re dipping, not by constantly taking new risks."
51,Anyone else feel like minting things just isn’t as fun as it used to be?
52,"Did you know there’s value projects out there that are actually delivering on their promises?
  
Crazy right? …Anyway these guys have a lot of Twitter followers so ima give them a few Eth and hope it’s good and complain when it’s not.

73,@Dreuseff Thanks for reading!
74,"Don't mint until you are ready. Don't buy until you are ready.
    
You might not always win, but you'll never make a loss by not making a snap decision."
75,"When people say to do your DD or DYOR, these are things that can take you a long way. If you think you don't have time to read up on all of these things because either a) you don't have the time, or b) the project is rushing you to buy and not giving you the time, then..."
76,Are they experienced? Who are their support networks and connections? Are they a diverse team? Are they even real people or are they just pictures next to fake names? They are essentially 'giving' you their CV and you have the opportunity to tell them whether they got the job.
77,"And remember, doxing isn't an automatic safety signal. Doxing gives you the opportunity to DYOR on the founder's/team's backgrounds. Use this to your advantage."
78,"You need to use discretion here. If a project or a founder starts marketing or interacting with a community i.e. Twitter, to promote that they have begun developing an NFT project, they may not have this all ready just yet. These are questions you can ask &amp; they should consider."
79,"Regardless, you should keep these in mind when thinking of purchasing an NFT, particularly if looking to buy into long-term projects or projects that you might consider a 'potential blue-chip'."
80,"Not everything will fall into this category and require all of these things, such as small artists releasing 1/1 collections or people who have no intention of building a continuing project, e.g. you agree to the terms that you are only purchasing a piece of art, nothing more."
81,"Keep in mind, many of these things apply to what we currently consider large (i.e. 10K) NFT collections, projects, brands etc.."
82,What are the terms of sale? Can you actually (legally) buy and sell these NFT without breaking the terms? Are you putting yourself at risk? What is that risk and how can you mitigate it? What happens after you sell your NFT? What are your rights and what can and can't you do?
83,"In that regard, what kind of license do they issue to the owner of the NFT? What do you actually own and have the rights to do? Is it royalty free? Do you care? This is up to you. It doesn't necessarily matter to all. Some see NFTs as simply investments that will move in and out."
84,"If they don't own the intellectual property, how do you expect them to protect you if someone takes their 'brand' from them? Being granted the rights to use your NFT for personal or commercial use is great, but it doesn't mean squat if they down own the IP themselves."
85,"Are you protected? Has the project, brand, name, website, NFTs, goods, services, Intellectual Property etc. been registered? What is protected by copyright law? What isn't? Can't find this information, check the bottom of their website. Still can't find it --&gt; question it."
86,Terms of Service/Use/T&amp;Cs: What are the legal agreements between the entity providing the service and the person using that service? What can you expect and what do they expect of you? If they have a website they should at least have this basic information. No terms --&gt; bounce.
87,Privacy Policy: Do they have (or are they going to release) a publicly available privacy policy? What kind of data are they collecting from you? What are they doing with that data? If there is no sign of this and they aren't willing to answer that --&gt; bounce.

I remember reading an article about when I did my PhD but it’s been a while, I’ll see if I can find it"
