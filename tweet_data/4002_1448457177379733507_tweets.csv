7,"@cipher0x @smolaliensclub Hey fren, thanks for supporting! Welcome 👽❤️"
8,"@Diamond_Cruiser Those were the questions I asked myself today and felt frustrated. I come from art/graphic design background, I reckon we lacked in marketing team/strategies, but working on hiring people who can help the project in these aspects is my top priority. Thx for CC and support ❤️❤️"
9,"@Diamond_Cruiser I am probably in top10 most active users in Doodles discord, fren. Active since mint day. https://t.co/0SqCoVQtaQ"
10,"@RhysKent93 yooo❤️ I just see you're founder of Drop Bears, I've been holding one for 5 months haha never listed, love mine. Thank you for supporting, ser!"

12,"@bweearg Thanks for the kind words, keep building, always ❤️"
13,"@Kenn1k_Nguyen U're just fudding at this point my fren, many projects mint out everyday with only 2-3 items on the roadmap ""launch - merch and charities"", or meme with a stealth launch. Market would mint if I filled discord w 100k bots and wash trade the first 1k mints, but I am not that person"
14,@nicdejean thanks for your kind words fellow dood ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
15,"@Kenn1k_Nguyen I am an artist. Might have failed in some aspects and already spent ~5 ETH with my humble project, not even thinking about profit, in fact I am ~$20k down."
16,"@Kenn1k_Nguyen Millions? Our intentions launching this project is to build amazing stuff, not a cash grab. And that would take the vast majority of the ""profits"". I might have failed in some aspects as marketing and etc, specially when starting with low capital, but our intentions are good."
17,"@chapmoney713 This!! In the end of the day, the ones with good intentions gonna win! WAGMI fren! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️"
18,@AyalaJonathan We going for 5k supply :) Hopefully we'll be seen soon
19,"@Ghost___x0 Thanks for the kind words, really means a lot ❤️"
20,"@gosmz_ I love to draw and love all kinds of art. I am an artist I make a living from my art for the last 5+ yrs (not NFTs). But I'm definitely not a good marketer. Even launching this project with low capital, already spent 5eth+. Feeling overwhelmed, but gotta trust the process ✨"
21,"@gosmz_ https://t.co/KtegcOERt6's sad when you see memes stealth launching overnight and selling out and the project you developed with love and care starts really slow. But I believe it will get traction at some point and I have the eager to build amazing stuff, I'm here and I'm ready⚡"
22,@PokeyNFT Thank you so muchhh for the support ❤️ I am down! Let's do it!!!

25,"@GirliesNFT Wow I love girlies! I am so humbled for your comment on my profile! This thread is making my day better, definitely! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️"
26,"@chroniccartoons Its tough my man. Literally spent so many hours working on it, gave up other jobs, gave up moments wifriends, weekends, then it feels like nobody wants even to see what you created, thats the worse. But I have faith things can change at any minute and I will be here to deliver ❤️"
27,@eyeshutterunot thanks fren ❤️❤️❤️

29,"@febhoney @uncoloreddood Thanks frens, I tweeted this after having a really rough day full of bad thoughts, and the replies on here are really helping me a lot ❤️❤️❤️"
30,"@sourceonemusic https://t.co/nn1zO6sDfv
Mint at 0.01 for the first 1000 ❤️ then gonna up to 0.05. Reveal starts Friday, no matter how many mints."
31,@Wintek_NFT @uncoloreddood I think the link was wrong (without httpS) on the bio. Fixed it now &lt;3
32,"@robmos_ I'm not aware of those/what happened! In fact I picked up the name ""smol"" months before any other collection existed haha it was just a weird coincidence, but it's a trending word it was just a matter of time to see projects using it."
33,@cozywyatt :dance: :dance: :dance:
34,@LoganAbnr is it? what do you get? it works for me and the few ones that minted so far haha
35,"@VirtualPizzaMan Thanks, it's been a little overwhelming, but there's always lessons to be learned ❤️"
36,"@SullySchwartz &lt;3 Thanks fam! I won't give up, hopefully something can spark and I will be there to execute all my plans, if the market choses so ❤️"
37,"Launched my project this morning after 4mo of dedication, and just had 18 mints (7 people) so far.  Web3 can be pretty frustrating. I have the best intentions and put so much energy on this and today feels like I haven't really made any friend in ~1 year in the space :("

56,"@LogueMonster Kinda hard to determine a criteria for claiming a Metamask token. You can't know what wallet was used to do any transaction. Maybe if it was related to the times you used the built-in swap function, but then I'd get screwed because I never used it, lol"
57,@dnwh_nft a degen move that finally pays off.

95,@itsmechase I think about that. When I reach a certain amount I would definetely put at least 50% in the stable coins that have a good yield. Some 25% for degening. And maybe 25% fiat.
96,@itsmechase When you think you can multiply that profit into other things
