18,"9/ Educate yourself and your peers.

A lot of these incidents can be avoided by taking your time to learn best practices and being careful. Spread the knowledge to others.

@gemxyz Discord is open for any questions. We’ll continue building products with your safety in mind. 💎❤️"
19,"8/ Limit Smart Contract Approvals

Most apps and marketplaces require you to give them approval for moving your NFTs. A hack can strike at any moment, so it’s best to prepared. Limit your exposure by removing these approvals regularly. I recommend https://t.co/PCzad0ICMu."
20,"7/ Be Skeptical of ALL Cold Contact

Bad actors are out to get your stuff. The weakest layer of security is you, the person. People will try to scam, phish, and deceive you. Always double-check and verify when someone contacts you on Discord, Twitter, or email. See below: https://t.co/gSwS41AWAU"
21,"6/ Avoid Get-Rich-Quick-Schemes

If it sounds too good to be true, it likely is. Engaging with obscure applications and their smart contracts is likely the highest risk of this list. They can let you approve or sign transactions which give them access to your NFTs."
22,"5/ Get Support via Official Channels

When engaging with support, always check if they are not impersonating mods. Credible support will help you out in public channels or ask you to DM them first. Never give anyone your seed phrase or private key - not even @VitalikButerin ."
23,"4/ Avoid Phishing  or Scam sites.

When using Web 3 apps, always double-check if it’s the real URL. Check for missing SSL (HTTPS) certificates or misspelling of the URL. Opt to use official twitter profiles of projects to visit URLs, instead of Googling them (malicious paid ads)."
24,"3/ Never give out your Seed Recovery Phrase.

Wallets come with a 12-24 word phrase, which allows others to access your private key. Leaking it = GAME OVER. Never share this phrase with anyone or input it in any application. Store it in physical form (paper), never on a computer."
25,"2/ Move your NFTs to a hardware wallet.

It’s important to keep your NFTs in cold storage, like a @Ledger or @tezos hardware wallet. This keeps your keys offline, which greatly reduces the chances of being hacked. A software wallet like @MetaMask is not recommended for storage."
26,"1/ 🔒On keeping your NFTs safe

The NFT space has a ton of awesome people in it, but its exponential growth also attracts opportunists and hackers who are out to steal your stuff.

It’s important to educate each other on simple rules for securing your NFTs 🧵"
