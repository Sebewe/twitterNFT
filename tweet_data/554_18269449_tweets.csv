Even the utility requirement is abating.
6 months from now, it'll be an entirely new set of demands from spectators who think they know best.
They don't. 
You and your true Community do."
23,"My top advice for anyone theorizing an NFT project right now: Do whatever you want. Much of what we were advised against, fudded over, or critiqued about with our collection is normalized if not widely practiced now. Do what's best for your NFTs and change the future."

58,"@RonnyyGuyy @AdamBombSquad @veefriends @BenHundreds @garyvee There are different ways to approach this.
Some people are day-trading for a quick flip and some ETH.
Others are investing in long-term plays, building projects that theoretically play out bigger in the end, plus there is a more meaningful journey.
I've always been the latter."

90,@Simon_Goldberg @farokh @DentedFeelsNFT @WeatheReportNFT Uhh YES 😂 it’s so streetwear. But it’s a part of any burgeoning subculture. This is life.
91,@coffeehustler @DentedFeelsNFT @WeatheReportNFT Yup. They’ll both crush. 💪🏽
92,"@farokh @DentedFeelsNFT @WeatheReportNFT Would love it if it was intentional, an elaborate marketing ploy where both sides reconcile a beef and everyone wins. Hope."
93,@_jeffnicholas_ @DentedFeelsNFT @WeatheReportNFT Always best to mind our own business 🙏🏽
94,"Over time, we’ll see what this tells us about cancel culture in crypto, the weight of branding/marketing (one has been promoting for 7 months, the other for 7 days), the power of community, and even IP confusion amongst projects. Good luck to both. Market is big enough for all."
95,"This entire @DentedFeelsNFT vs @WeatheReportNFT saga is one of the strangest corners of NFT history thus far. I’m curious to see how it plays out, and hey, maybe it’ll somehow result in a net positive for both parties. Maybe they join forces. Who knows? It’s Web3. Anything goes."
