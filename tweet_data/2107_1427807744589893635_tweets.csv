26,3/ All retweets to get this far and wide is very much appreciated – thanks in advance for your support.
27,2/ There are five pieces left – four at 0.15E and one at 0.3E - so if all sell that’s 0.9E.  As a call to action the sales need to happen by the end of March 2022. The collection is here: https://t.co/jQgLWsIdX6
28,1/ It’s always difficult knowing how to respond to such massive geopolitical events. One feels so small and helpless. But small things can make a difference; that’s why I’ve decided to donate 100% of any further sales in my “Winter” collection to @RedCrossUkraine. https://t.co/vnXYWhWg50
