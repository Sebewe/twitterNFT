7,"@shad0wbits It's a fair question - I haven't seen enough info about the likely leakers here to make an assessment. There is precedent for leaked data to be altered though...I thought I recalled a good roll-up of that somewhere, but can't find it. Maybe someone knows what I'm thinking of?"

10,"Yes, the Conti leaks are interesting and analysts should look at them. But remember we don't know if the info was altered before leaking or if it's completely accurate. Intel analysts consider multiple sources before reaching an assessment. I highly recommend that approach."
