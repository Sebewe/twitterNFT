32,i vote for $Ape
33,wgmi state of mind. $Ape
34,just like you can do absolutely good by just hodl-ing #Bitcoin and #ETH. You can do bonkers with just #BAYC and #MAYC.
35,"@popvape yeah but the burden security always falls on the one holding the keys, self custody comes with the burden of responsibility and accountability for what you do with your keys."
36,"opensea was not hacked, if it was we would be more screwed than you think."
37,stop confusing scams for hacks. a ‘hack’ that involves social engineering is not a real hack. it’s a scam.
38,you don’t need to be a coder and/or understand solidity to implement this simple strategy; never click/sign things with this machine/wallet.
39,"RT @BlackAppleArt: @WizKingNFT The alpha is everywhere..👀

40,@DEXXADNFT @GoTrillaGorilla @BlackAppleArt Yes indeed. https://t.co/hi0l6mwAND
41,"@jdiamo91 Lol yeah except that, ions ago. Let it go already 😂"
42,@jdiamo91 Ethereum’s layer 1 is impenetrable. Scams have nothing to do with the protocol itself.
43,@GoTrillaGorilla It is there in the script 😂

50,"@BoredApeGazette @boredape8677 its a pleasure, thank you for all you do for the community."
51,"@BoredApeGazette @boredape8677 yes. you are fine. even with just revoking approval you are fine, i was just being thorough in case you list again in the future. if you did not delist, revoking does not delist. you have to do individual delisting."
52,"@BoredApeGazette @boredape8677 Yes. and Yes and No. But if you listed some items before and did not delist them, they are still listed even though the listing can not be executed."
53,"@BoredApeGazette @boredape8677 yes. but this is the wildwest, noone can give the assurance. as long as you did nothing wrong on your end, contrary to popular beliefs, hacks rarely happen, in most cases, its scams. and if that be true, it's impossible for even OS to sell your items without your signature."
54,"@BoredApeGazette @boredape8677 yes. what you see there, is all the contracts that have approval from your wallet.""ownable delegate"" is fancy for OS. if you don't see it there it's not approved. another way of being sure is trying to list an item from a collection. you will be prompted to approve. https://t.co/9iBMpslBq1"
55,@BoredApeGazette @boredape8677 make sure you are turning on contract in the far right corner. this will reveal all contracts that have approval from your wallet. https://t.co/xpDRjBuuni

63,@The_DevinWills https://t.co/hEgM1NSfRI haven’t used this one in while but it’s pretty cool too.
64,@The_DevinWills https://t.co/ECZuJmsOXY is pretty cool
65,@smems_ i should think so. but OS UI is not trustworthy. so i’d check manually.
66,"@smems_ good plan, but i’d advice to use a brand new one or delist all listings individually in addition to revoking. otherwise it’s very easy to forget that there are listings that are executable and end up loosing down the line."
67,"revoke approval is a blanket aproval on the entire collection, it does not take care of individual listings and for that reason. it will not bring your address to brand new status, because a brand new address has no listing or approvals."
68,"because listing requires it, so think of this scenario, you have 7 apes, 3 listed, #6, #4 and 1#. you revoke approval because you no longer want to sell all of them, but down the line you want to sell #7. the moment you list #7, all the Apes ever listed are executable. 2/3"
69,"ok. Long answer No. NO mostly because of this part of your question, ""wallet as brand new"". Token Approval does not cancel listings. so can never be as brand new, because those listing will be executable the moment you list any other item in that collection... 1/3 https://t.co/9gpBYCnUR8"
70,Every Ape derivative project will be buying $Ape on launch day😂 it’s gonna be a circus.
