5,"@GratefulApe_eth @ShortsHoward @0xQuit Hey man it’s okay. People deal with things differently, and sometimes it’s by talking about other things. Some people can’t mentally handle this type of stuff so they talk and focus on other things. Nothing wrong with it. We all have our ways with dealing with things. 🙏"
6,@Jon54989749 I know a lot of people that literally avoid any type of news cause they mentally can’t handle the negativity in the world. We going to attack them for their mental health? People are just hypocritical that’s all. Just be compassionate towards others feelings that’s all.
7,"@Jon54989749 @osf_nft I agree with this take too. Some people deal with things differently and no one can judge people for that. Just cause I’m not tweeting about it doesn’t mean I don’t care, doesn’t mean I didn’t donate to help others. Just means I decided to not talk about it. It’s kinda ridiculous"

24,"@ForTheBux @RDM_41 @GoGalaGames I also have seen it way too many times in esports and now the NFT industry so many people raise x amount of capital and when things are not delivered or expectations not met,  it drives valuable people out of the industry."
25,"@ForTheBux @RDM_41 @GoGalaGames /2 pressure on people that respect him and you guys especially knowing the NFT and your community are the targets. We are so new and need to do things correctly and not many people know who BT is, so they see the numbers."
26,"@ForTheBux @RDM_41 @GoGalaGames /1 First I respect everything you and @GoGalaGames are doing in the space. When I say over ambitious I mean defending that the 8-11 eth was worth it.

44,"@GratefulApe_eth Literal FUD. Apparently a start up that turned into a billion dollar evaluation in less then a month can’t pay salaries to unpaid workers, and taking out money to turn into USD to run a legitimized business is wrong too I guess."

53,@edyy98MC @orangie @LVNnft @ChangeLamer @JackedApeClub You guys do understand that when you get “paid” for work that money is now owned by the worker. You don’t get paid to work to then donate that money back to the company that paid you to work to help build that company.
54,"@JackedApeClub This is terrible for not just ur brand, but now you put @BradleyMartyn own brand at risk especially if this fails. Smh. Work with the right people!"

61,"@0xHustler @elgaetr I respect that, and what you have done. Have a good night my man."
62,"@0xHustler @elgaetr You don’t, but your questioning why you think you should follow people that own an NFT you own, and if everyone had ur mindset these NFT’s would be worthless. Anyways I get it you are a influencer or whatever so you going to do you regardless. Have a good day."
63,"@0xHustler @elgaetr I think you are missing the point about how these NFT’s sell out. It’s not just about the artwork, or utilities. It’s about the community behind it and the engagement from that community. No community, those NFT’s you own become worthless."
