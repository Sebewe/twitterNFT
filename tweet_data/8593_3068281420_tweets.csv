17,"@KOBESYSTEM143 @KingBlackBored @GutterCatGang It’s sad that people feel these disclaimers are necessary the moment anyone mentions a political affliction. Agree with BlackBored or not, he is entitled to his opinions and in no way should that impact a project that he or anyone else holds. Cancel culture is dangerous"

19,@Mincashftw Same here. I jumped in head first b/c I saw it in gutter picks. Unfortunate that it was a verified member of the gang. I’ve minted at least 5 straight up rug pulls from “alpha” in gutter picks. Seems like the only good plays are white lists these days. Lots of manufacturers hype

31,@TheNFTPunisher Interesting take. I couldn’t disagree more. The developers and building something bigger which takes time. It’s definitely not a cash grab when they have a bigger paid team than any other project. Just out of curiosity - do you hate all NFTs or are there any projects you like?
