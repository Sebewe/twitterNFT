10,@andrwwang Talking about Wonderpals?
11,@arzum_tak @michaeleosada @WonderPals Can I connect my wallet to your website and mint a few more?!
12,"@428MKH @WonderPals There are some fake Wonderpal accounts messaging back to back, be careful of those!"
13,"@lnjks Thank you, would you like my seed phrase or the Ledger itself mailed to your address?"
14,"@michaeleosada @WonderPals Base fee: 153.5 GWEI
Priority Fee: 9.1 GWEI
Lol"
15,"@428MKH @WonderPals You have to set it yourself to avoid the gas war, but I paid only 35 bucks for gas!
It was all luck, I would say!"
16,"@WonderPals Thank you guys, can't believe I got the #9999 one!"
17,"Hollllllllyyyyyyyyyyyy Sh***********t!!!!!!!!!!

18,"@DrifterShoots @SuperRare Haha!
🤩🤎"
19,"@DrifterShoots @SuperRare Is this the “Where My Vans Are?”, your new collection that I am allow listed for?!"
20,"@WonderPals Although it is difficult I wish instead of a public mint, you chose a raffle extension to avoid a gas war, but that might be too much at this point for your devs!"
21,"@KPMG_Canada @worldofwomennft That is a brilliant choice!
I hope you cook some solutions/tools that improve the NFT community’s experience with dealing with accounting and bookkeeping stuff, and maybe even DAOs!
Here is an advice, though, please do not launch an NFT (PFP) project; thanks!"
22,"@farokh I agree, I assume they have some plans since the Big Four (I.e., KPMG, Deloitte, EY, PWC) are those who could help with both legal and accounting aspects of NFTs, Metaverse, etc.! 
More than a million potential customers are ready to use a proper tool for their Web3 accounting!"
23,"@farokh Dude!😂
But seriously, they can help you with the Rug Radio’s legal aspects and its DAO requirements to decrease future potential issues!!!"
24,@CryptoJuanS @robotosNFT @buenonft Beep Boop!

26,"@ohhshiny @AlexMasmej @tryShowtime @7Surfer7Silver7 @apaley13 @MiniNations It seems that the community has asked for a Shiny's Proof of Hug(s)! 
Should we build a POH to compete with @poapxyz ?

83,"Early 2021 NFT projects dealt with the whole Gas War issue, while now the Allowlist/Whitelist war has made it even more difficult to get into appealing projects, and you have to extra miles to get in! 
However, having a big pocket does not determine the winners anymore!

95,"RT @punk6529: 1/2 

My understanding so far about the opensea hack/phish

a) You would have had to sign a malicious transaction from a site…"
96,"@DrifterShoots @WMVGSalesBot @VANS_66 That is an extremely wise strategy to determine and take control of your own art, instead of letting some collectors who do not necessarily believe in your art manage that!
Wen WMVG sneakers btw?!🤩"
97,@ohhshiny The latter is neither in the best interest of the “community-&gt;fanclub” nor the company since it depreciates both values!
98,"@farokh WLY,F!💙"
