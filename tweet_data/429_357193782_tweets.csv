36,"@stack__sats @farokh @MichaelTant3 @infamousXBT @nicksdjohnson @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains the virtue signaling permeating web3 i accept, as it is their right, but the asinine arguments supporting intolerant action to silence intolerant speech, i do not."
37,"@stack__sats @farokh @MichaelTant3 @infamousXBT @nicksdjohnson @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains after that, revisit freedom of speech: a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction."
38,"@stack__sats @farokh @MichaelTant3 @infamousXBT @nicksdjohnson @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains i think it's appropriate for anyone taking a hard line against free speech to first read the definition of intolerance: unwillingness to accept views, beliefs, or behavior that differ from one's own."
39,"@RienzoKennedy @rebekah_bastian @ensdomains intolerance: unwillingness to accept views, beliefs, or behavior that differ from one's own."
40,@Satoshis_Mom @cryptoadzNFT !vibe
41,hating intolerant speech is fine. taking action to silence any speech is not. you do not get to hide behind the rationalization of “making web3 a safe space for everyone” by threatening the job of a single one because you disagree with what they say. that makes you a hypocrite.
42,@rebekah_bastian @ensdomains popper was specifically addressing violence to suppress debate of those unwilling to have rational arguments. he was strongly against those who refused to debate ideas.
43,@betty_nft cope
44,"@YouSoFancy @rebekah_bastian @ensdomains irrelevant. my statement was responding to her statement. everyone in web3 should act like they're in web3, not web2."
45,"@rebekah_bastian @ensdomains the toxicity is intolerance of opposing viewpoints. if your belief was the minority and you faced losing your job for speaking your mind, you wouldn't make such an insular statement. web3 is about freedom, including freedom of speech."
46,"this is your opportunity to exercise tolerance and open mindedness, to demonstrate that web3 is where everyone is free to speak their fucking mind. don't go web2 on @BrantlyMillegan."
47,"freedom is the bedrock of web3: freedom from centralization, freedom from censorship, and freedom of speech are all integral to our space. he should be allowed to speak his mind, however repugnant that may be, just as you should be allowed to speak yours without losing your job."
48,@karsendaily @BrantlyMillegan how did I get left out of this between vibrators and ethical porn? clearly an oversight
49,"@0xsussboi @BrantlyMillegan you know that's what he likely wants, right?"
