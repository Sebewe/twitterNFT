2,@CaseyJScalf You should do both make a meta thread that holds all your threads. Then make your threads a synopsis of your articles/blogs. Make each thread fragment a small little preview of a bigger paragraph from the longer form with featured images when needed. Then each tweet is a hook.
3,@CaseyJScalf just said medium as a verb. I feel like mediums kinda shit tbh. Twitter threads honestly is the best option. That games the twitter algo and gets you like minded followers  especially if your a consistent threader. Best to learn in the open. Reminds me I am due for a thread.

https://t.co/7yLg7YMLOb"
25,"The best way to protect yourself from all this as a user is to setup your MM wallet to point to the Flashbots RPC.
Dont be a noob and use the public mem pool.
Its the same method you do when your adding a new L2 into your wallet. 
No more sandwhiched trades. No more failed trans."
26,This is mostly all done on the Flashbots network. Flashbots is a private network where you can send transaction bundles directly to miners and not publicly show your trades in the public mem pool to get exploited.
27,You would then sell this bundled transaction of yours and the apple farmers to a miner. The miner will typicaly take like 80%-90% of the profit from the bundle. This is where the term miner extracted value comes from.
28,You notice that this apple farmer wants to trade for 10 oranges. What you would do as a MEV (seeker) is arbitrage trade in the same block as the trade is happening. You would bundle the first transaction the farmer +10🍎 then you bundle your aritrage trade -10🍎 right after it.
29,"Lets say your an arbitrage trader waiting for those poor apple farmers to make a huge trade causeing large slippage for you to gobble up. 

What you would do is observe the public memory pool (mem pool) where everyones transactions are gathered before they are put into a block. https://t.co/vQATXIUIv9"
30,Yes he basically did. That is what is refered to as slippage. In this example the farmer traded 5% of the pool which cause the price to drastically change and created that arbitrage opportunity. Now that you understand Dexes like uniswap lets bring this example back to MEV
31,"The beauty of uniswap is notice how we never even refered to a USD, BTC or a ETH price we only priced them relative to each other. The outside world via arbitage is what determines the price. 
So you may be wondering well didnt the apple farmer just give away some of the apples?"
32,This will almost instantly happen because the current market rate is 1:1 so anyone buying those 10 apples stands to profit. This is what is refered to as an arbitrage trade and is the main mechanic that drives uniswap price discovery. Also refered to as front running.
33,"Remeber how from earlier the 1🍎 = 1🍊
Well the pool now is showing 1🍎 = 0.81 🍊
This is where the magic happens. Uniswap now needs another trader to do the opposite of the apple farmer and buy up those 10 extra apples to get the pool back in balance."
34,"So now your the apple farmer you just farmed 10🍎apples. You put 10 apples into the pool and receive back 10 oranges 🍊
The pool balance is now as follows:
110🍎 + 90🍊 = 200 (🍎/🍊)
Notice the constant stays constant. https://t.co/b4vSksEa5E"
35,"Notice how there is no reference to any other currrency besides oranges and apples. When you add them together you get a constant value of 200 (🍎/🍊)

That is what the constant product market means. Both units will add up to always be the same constant amount."
36,"Lets say that you are an apple🍎 farmer and you want to trade for oranges 🍊
The current conversion rate is 1🍊 = 1🍎

Now some nice person offered to put 100 of each into a community pool so any person can come and swap for the other one.
Pool:
100🍎 + 100🍊 =  Constant (200) https://t.co/MrlO6BtqSN"
37,"You may be wondering ok what does this look like in practice? Well lets use a basic example of Uniswap. Uniswap is a decentralized exhange that uses a constant product market maker model.

Ok you may be asking wtf does that mean?

Let me explain that with a fruit analogy."
38,"MEV stands for (Miner extractable value). 
Ok cool now you get it.......

Basically thats kinda it. Miners in addition to getting transaction fees and the block reward can also earn extra value outside of the main consysus. Lets dive in."
39,"You probably heard a lot about MEV or flashbots. You may have heard about bots extracting money out of your trades on uniswap. Or bots buying an entire block to sweep the punks floor. What is this MEV and wtf is going on?
MEV for the laymen a🧵"
