6,@TakisUSA Definitely more than 1
7,@Dougdesautels @FPSaddiction I second this ^ I hate being high but also hate prescription pain meds. Care By Design offers really low % gummies/tinctures that don’t get me high but offer pain relief
8,@Rickochino No it’s a power move.
9,"Some mornings the light shines through this window in a certain way and it looks so sick. Anyway, gm https://t.co/eXGHFI72XP"

19,"@Andreas29335238 In my 3 years of ownership, never paying for gas, never having to change my oil, never having to worry about my transmission giving out, etc, has been very nice. If I had like $100k to blow, I don’t think I’d get a Tesla, but it’s EXTREMELY practical as a daily for me"
20,"@Andreas29335238 That’s always been the point that interests me because my first model 3 was $35k, which seems preettyyyy cheap for buying a brand new car. I wouldn’t expect some crazy luxury interior for $35k. I don’t wanna sound like a Tesla fanboy, but I really do like them hahaha"
21,"@Andreas29335238 My friend and I were actually just talking about this. Obviously everyone has their opinions, but I’ve had a Tesla for almost 4 years now and I LOVE them. What do you hate about them?"
