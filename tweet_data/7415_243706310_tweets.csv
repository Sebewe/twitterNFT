0,@mensaisliterate Thank you Mensa ☺️ A little nervous and also excited to help with my work.
1,"RT @mensaisliterate: oh wow! a poem written with chocolate, to support black ukrainian refugees

check it out:"
2,RT @timlampe: Incredible work from Danielle for a good cause
3,"If you aren't participating in NFTs, that's okay, you can still help! Spreading the word or donating to these sites directly would be impactful. Help me support people on the ground!

4,"Everything is tempered, except the line ""ooze a molten victory."" Untempered chocolate is considered unfit for fanfare or decoration in the chocolate world. Much like war, victory isn't quite victorious. https://t.co/oRu0MeTvoY"
5,"The type style shifts from ordered and smooth to aggressive and chaotic. This mirrors the disruption of war to everyday life. 

The bottom lines attempt to return to normalcy, a paradox. Life continues while never the same. https://t.co/7MtgyNKdpT"
6,"On the day of the invasion I wrote a poem comparing chocolate and war bc #IStandWithUkraine. And I knew food type could add an extra layer to this story.

Tempered chocolate is a delicate balance. It snaps cleanly, stretches to hold its shape, much like peace between nations. https://t.co/23bLftRzR4"
7,"Help me out #web3! I am auctioning my first piece @KnownOrigin_io, a war poem made entirely of chocolate, for Ukrainian refugees.

9,RT @vukiledlamini19: It’s has been a difficult journey and the road is very long. Please donate what you can to support all of us stranded…
10,"@amber_vittoria Yes! We all know our current systems aren't working and I'm excited to explore other options in web3. Sharing process is interpreted as Creative Commons permissions, which doesn't work in marketplaces. I'm sorry you have to quit but do what you have to for your health/sanity!"
11,"If you can point to at least one of your pieces that is being used and especially if it’s being used to make money, that’s too close. 

It truly is that simple. I love that Amber is normalizing theft discussion in the open. It’s the only way things change. https://t.co/GC3bZUgrqP"
12,"Finished. This is the most complex piece of my career, a morsel of activism for those locked in a bitter struggle today. #IStandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 https://t.co/SRj8QB2nEa"
13,@RitaCVargas @ladygrey1111 I have migrated to looking up witch apparel on etsy 😅
14,"@RitaCVargas @ladygrey1111 The PLUM LIPPPPPP, RITA 😍"
15,"@jasonnaylornyc Even the chocolate means something. There’s a line about victory which is untempered chocolate.

Untempered chocolate dull and ugly, not fit for decor or garnish. You can eat it, but the mouthfeel is half-hearted and is better unseen.

That’s the power of lettering with food."
16,@jasonnaylornyc Thank you. I tried to capture the disruption of every day life by the frantic reality of war and the fight to return to “normal” though a forever-altered one.
17,"@jasonnaylornyc Thank you, it was a meditation in love, war, and how much I want to detangle the ties between both."

24,"@zaingaziani Thanks, I was on the raw end of it and had several years to form a counterpoint 😬 But that said, @amber_vittoria is right, I love that web3 is willing and able to discuss these ideas. The rules are changing because we are so interconnected."
25,"@zaingaziani It’s natural for markets to produce offshoots, derivatives, etc. However when we see incidents like this, the community decides if it matters. If it’s left unaddressed it becomes the glass ceiling for the entire industry."
26,"@flynnkristina @amber_vittoria Too dangerously for my blood but YOLO, frens 🥲"
27,"@amber_vittoria @flynnkristina 1000% Also asking myself if this project was for me. If the hype didn’t grab me, it wasn’t! 😅"

37,@jaimederringer gm!! So cool!!
38,"Community building fascinates me, as many of these conditions are agreed upon subconsciously. As web3 and world events unfold in tandem, we are asked to define how we unite and what tears us apart."
39,"I’ve been guilty of saying “why does this need a law? Why can’t we teach people to be decent?” in the past. But laws allow for min. protections. 

I enjoy shaping culture organically because I unite with others over shared values. And yet we need codes of conduct."
40,"Of course there are always counter movements, like the introduction of US human rights bills because the culture keeps failing protected classes. 

Or in a place like web3, if you don’t grasp the vibe but have cash, you can form a board."
41,"Generally, progressives change the future via culture, where conservatives use legislation.

I see this irrespective of political alignment. If you have no cultural foothold, you’ll form a committee. If you have no political sway, you’ll take to the streets."

45,"@p_x_studio @myk31 Of course, doing my best in any small way!!"
46,"@ladygrey1111 Yes! Disinfo campaigns seek to muddy any clarity the truth brings to light. The object is to see less clearly and stall action.

Misinfo campaigns work the same way. So glad someone said this."
47,@leesteffen If not I am ✨upset✨
48,"@joshhemsley Pretty sure @MatVoyce could handle it, but be warned, he’s brilliant and expensive 🤑🤌"

70,"@jasonnaylornyc Thank you my friend, same to you. Currently I’m safe, but this will impact my ability to see my partner. He’s in France, but Europe is slowing some paperwork processing in preparation for refugees. 

This is part of my war, but not my battle. And yet we are all connected."

72,@andynewman gm my fren 💙
73,"In the year I’ve spent consulting a climate NGO, I’ve learned peace is not passive.

Peace is an active battle we must wage for equilibrium and calm. 

This is not a right sadly, it is earned through boundaries and pushing back against oppressive forces."
74,"@jasonnaylornyc Jason I love how you’ve worded this, acknowledging reality and determining to find hope. This is how we survive. 💙"
75,The battle for survival became a war. Do whatever you must to win your health today.
