20,@Loopifyyy I will not and would not recommend to touch the new OS contract until they have provided a 100% transparent &amp; easy to digest description of what went wrong.
21,"@Loopifyyy If it is an issue with the new contract as reported by some already a month ago, and this vulnerability has lead to the exploit, OS has a whole lot of explaining to do. 

At this point I am unsure, but I doubt that many Degens would fall for a phishing email scam."
