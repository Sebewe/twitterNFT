23,"@AGreenDCBike @kbilletz @crypto_coven nope! we evaluated the options, and chose S3 in the end, mainly due to performance

but as xuannü mentioned, we would consider switching to IPFS one day, if it meets our needs 🙂"
24,"@kbilletz @crypto_coven but no need to fret 😉
- we store our metadata on IPFS
- we have multiple backup copies of each art asset layer
- if something happens to S3, we would be able to rehydrate the witches based on the metadata, and upload their visages to another service ✨"
