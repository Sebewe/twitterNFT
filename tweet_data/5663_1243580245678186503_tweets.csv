4,@harshrajat @EthereumDenver @sandeepnailwal @epnsproject @Riijo @rahilla So glad you came to the screening! Hope we can meet soon!

6,@POVdocs @NotGoingQuiet @lizjaff @AdyBarkan @PBS @BeaHero @rachael_scar @ryderhaske @AmandaR0ddy @traceyecorder Sometimes we would show @AdyBarkan footage but we wouldn't always listen to his feedback 😂
7,Couldn't leave our @POVdocs #TwitterChat without sharing some exclusive behind-the-scenes moments from filming @NotGoingQuiet ♥️ #NotGoingQuietlyPBS https://t.co/1vIOYYdeiB
8,@AmandaR0ddy @POVdocs @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder 💯💯💯
9,"Final question in our #TwitterChat with @POVdocs about @NotGoingQuiet! Check it out to hear what myself, @AmandaR0ddy, @lizjaff, @traceyecorder and @rachael_scar had to say about @AdyBarkan and making this film together. #NotGoingQuietlyPBS https://t.co/Jp5FdMIB9e"
10,"@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder @BeaHero @AdyBarkan The movie documents an important chapter in @AdyBarkan's life, but I truly believe his best and most impactful work is ahead of him."
11,@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder Our democracy is at stake. The first step is to retain democratic control of the house and increase our majority in the senate. I think the most important step people can take to protect health care and our democracy is to get involved with @BeaHero and join @AdyBarkan's fight.
12,@lizjaff @POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @traceyecorder Who is here for the Liz Jaff spin-off documentary coming next? 🙋🏽‍♂️
13,@lizjaff @POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @traceyecorder This story is so good we almost included it in the film 😂
14,@rachael_scar @AmandaR0ddy @POVdocs @lizjaff @traceyecorder Seems like we can all agree that hope is a 🔨
15,"Our @NotGoingQuiet #TwitterChat is flying! Question 4 is up. Check out the answers from me, @AmandaR0ddy @lizjaff @traceyecorder and @rachael_scar! #NotGoingQuietlyPBS https://t.co/YqGhMRUevi"
16,"@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder 3/3 I’m so grateful to @AdyBarkan, @rachael_scar, @traceyecorder, &amp; @lizjaff for bringing @AmandaR0ddy  and I on this journey. ♥️"
17,"@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder 2/3 It’s a message that transcends politics. I also hope that all the activists already using their stories as a weapon to fight for a better world, feel seen and represented by Ady’s story on screen."
18,"@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder 1/3 On the ground level, I hope that every audience member who watches Not Going Quietly leaves feeling uplifted and energized, and takes Ady’s message to heart–that hope is not a state of mind, hope is a state of action, and hope is a hammer that we use to build a better world."
19,Question 3 of our #TwitterChat with @POVdocs about @NotGoingQuiet! @AmandaR0ddy @lizjaff @traceyecorder @rachael_scar #NotGoingQuietlyPBS https://t.co/DHfGQFb9O0
20,"@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder @NotGoingQuiet 3/3 And that's what I think Ady does through his work, and in the film you understand that those moments of him being with family are made possible by the healthcare and the providers that he's fighting for other people to have."
21,@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder @NotGoingQuiet 2/3 The approach to making Not Going Quietly was not so much about balancing the personal with the political but rather erasing that line or erasing that boundary as if those things are separate.
22,@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder 1/3 I think that all storytellers have great privilege and responsibility. I think that it's possible to make movies (and I hope @NotGoingQuiet is one of them) that entertain while engaging with social issues in a real way.
23,Question 2 of our #TwitterChat with @POVdocs about @NotGoingQuiet! Check it out to hear from @AmandaR0ddy @lizjaff @traceyecorder @rachael_scar &amp; myself in real time :) #NotGoingQuietlyPBS https://t.co/BnrRkfVHnZ
24,"@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder 3/3 In the ensuing years, as the US waged successive wars based on lies and xenophobia, I felt that I wanted to use my skills as a filmmaker to build bridges and create empathy.  There is no better medium than documentary to do that."
25,"@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder 2/3 As a Manhattan native, I remember skating down to ground zero on Sept. 11 with my video camera, seeing if there was anything I could to help or document."
26,"@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder 1/3 I’ve been making movies since I was a little kid with my mini VHS camera, and growing up wanting, like any teenage filmmaker in NYC, to be the next Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry."
27,"Question 1 from @POVdocs for us about @NotGoingQuiet–check out the answers from me, @AmandaR0ddy @lizjaff @traceyecorder &amp; @rachael_scar! #NotGoingQuietlyPBS https://t.co/bkAeJl9Lc1"
28,@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder @BeaHero @AdyBarkan 4/4 I believe Ady is one of the great civil rights leaders of our time - I wanted (and want) to be a part of helping him be remembered.
29,"@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder @BeaHero @AdyBarkan 3/4 There was urgency to start filming bc of his ALS progression. Ady only had about 6mo left to speak from the day I met him, so we needed to capture all of his words. Little did we know he would have so much to say–and on such a bigger stage–after he lost his physical voice."
30,"@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder @BeaHero @AdyBarkan 2/4 Not only was he an amazing activist father, but he had such a great sense of humor about his own journey with fatherhood, life &amp; legacy. The whole crew was crying/laughing when he described his, let’s just say, candid feelings about Republicans opposing expanding health care."
31,"@POVdocs @AmandaR0ddy @rachael_scar @lizjaff @traceyecorder 1/4 In 2018 I got a call from the one-and-only @lizjaff to film a short promo video for @BeaHero, the healthcare org she and @AdyBarkan were co-founding. I flew out to Santa Barbara to meet Ady, and was immediately drawn not only to his story but to his personality."
