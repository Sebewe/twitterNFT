4,"@casseodigital @OGDfarmer Haha of course, more meant if there was a specific event given we were a few days in before the jump"
5,@OGDfarmer Just the price jump or did I miss a trigger?
6,@kurtybot Will be sure to wave as I fly past on my 97 jump 😂

12,@Mezmon1 @economist What interview? Got a link?
13,@heroku is there a way to transfer something hosted from one account to another without changing the url? Thinking about changing ownership of an api listed with you specifically.
14,👀👀👀 https://t.co/twnNv6OPoq
15,"@BabyCoby_ @opensea Really interesting. So a Collection creator can just invoke the owner() method to attribute ownership, control and future royalties to a new address? Assuming the platform implements properly?"
16,@Ape7068 @Apple @BoredApeYC Bravo!
17,@dredVonZepp This actually looks really damn good!

19,@BabyCoby_ @opensea Do you mean like a collection ownership as a whole? How do you do that?

21,@BlueBadger2600 @nice_jpeg Ohhhh gotcha. Good to know my full time job of staying on top of the NFT space is going well 😬
22,@nice_jpeg @BlueBadger2600 They haven’t minted yet? So what did people buy… am I being stupid?
23,@BlueBadger2600 Wait.. what did I miss?
24,@NFLALLDAY marketplace is super interesting - some crazy low pricing when you look at series 1 pricing across @nbatopshot
25,Wen @Coinbase_NFT ?

32,I finally hit the pack drop collector score needed to get the more high end @nbatopshot packs. Now I'll have the chance to queue up and buy $999 packs. Now I'm here I'm scared that isn't a good thing! Any insight on the +/-EV people normally see from these packs? #NBATopShotThis
33,💎👐 since 0.3... but feeling an unexpected struggle today. They've come and passed before. Any #BAYC got some words of encouragement?
34,Who are the 16?? Show yourselves!! #web3 #twitteraudit https://t.co/e17ulCFWwz
35,"I’ve managed to rip 26 moments in the @NFLALLDAY open beta. If the market place holds current levels at open tomorrow, they are worth more than my 400+ @nbatopshot moments combined. Is this what it’s like to be early?"
36,@dubz0922 Timmy McKimmy?
37,@bottl_rock Sweet mutant!
38,I feel like things are flat... what we minting this week?? #nft #web3 #mint

52,@pmouratoglou Welcome brother!
53,@BobbyBananasNFT Brilliant question
54,@RiceFarmerNFT Haha such a good question
55,@NFTsAreNice Feels weirder when you tell people that then tell them you have no interest in selling
56,"I can’t remember the last time I sat and thought about buying something real. Like something physical. Striking me how weird life has become. 

Anyone got any recommendations for some cool IRL stuff?

63,@U_B_L how does one get their baller I got he league?
64,@BoristheApe1481 Definitely can’t throw a full car at something I’ve never heard of! 🤣
65,@BoristheApe1481 Where?!
66,@wiseleopard1 @BoredApeYC Another great thread… can’t wait for the next one - want to binge them like a Netflix set 😂
67,@0x_Ramen @_kingdomacademy This is a huge find IMO. Founders are writers - I bet there are loads of clues in here.
68,@_kingdomacademy Love to read this stuff! Thanks. For putting it together - followed 🤝
69,I love seeing successful drops saying they broke OpenSea. Got to be the least impressive claim to fame ever 😂
70,"@davidbankless @Desigg @wolfdotgame Ahh that explains the price difference. Now I wish I bought farmers at 0.6 when instead I bought land!! 

MUST DO MORE RESEARCH!!"
71,"@davidbankless @Desigg @wolfdotgame Oh right, I hadn’t realised the difference in supply"
72,@davidbankless @Desigg @wolfdotgame Interesting. I’d argue land has all of that except the PFP element which I don’t see as much of a draw here. We’ll see soon enough I hope!
73,@davidbankless @Desigg @wolfdotgame Why so?
74,@BonnieLass88 @BoredApeYC First Scottish ape I’ve come across! Good to see another Brit!
