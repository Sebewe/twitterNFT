3,"@kfilll @HeuristicLineup @BSWest5 It’s all just really strange. Rug pulls happen in NFT land, but Fox 1) has plenty of money 2) will face public backlash for rug pulling and 3) seemingly could have just hired someone to keep the project going."
4,@HeuristicLineup @BSWest5 Incorrect read. He promised supporting a long term project and just closed up shop. Most NFT owners won’t get the jersey.
5,@HeuristicLineup @BSWest5 That’s only for a small subset of NFT owners

78,@calebwait Niners didn’t make the plays that they needed to win down the stretch. The rams did. I don’t think it was about willpower. Niners battled all season through a ton of adversity.
