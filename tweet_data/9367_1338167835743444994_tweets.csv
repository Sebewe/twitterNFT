3,@dystopiabreaker Well there's cnbc reporting on this given patreon shut down the thing that was being organized there just for them to pivot to using btc instead. Media can't make up their mind on if crypto is good or bad. https://t.co/QbRZxItCO3

7,@mikedemarais It'd be so slow in rollout that you probably wouldn't see the fallout all at once so it wouldn't be a mass displacement. Approving let alone implementing that level of restructure would see still be impacted by the heavy bureaucratic shenanigans it's trying to replace.

11,@0xMerquise Ope forgot sauce for this one. Segregation is still very much alive and it lives in gerrymandering and school district boundaries. https://t.co/bFWTGiIkyy
12,"@0xMerquise But there's also another Dayton municipality that was segregated until about 1965, post-Jim Crow, and they didn't end their Sundown Town bs until the govt built an air force base there and forced the town to quit their shit. They just moved instead and built new invisible walls."
13,@0xMerquise There's a perfect example of that within a large city close to me in Ohio called Dayton. Oakwood is a predominantly white municipality within Dayton that has segregated itself to where all their money stays with the one mostly white school in a city where white ppl are minorities
14,"@0xMerquise Engaging in local politics makes that very very apparent, ngl. I'd ve in my son's school and delegate to a board member of my choosing, or even just opt to direct vote without delegation, if most board issues were thrown up on commonwealth/snapshot. Could open rev streams too."
15,@0xMerquise I'd argue nearly all votes in democratic systems have a dollar amount attached when you consider campaign funds/time spent at acquiring those votes. Especially with an 'attention economy' like current web2 practices. There's even a price tag associated w/ engagement.

21,"@EtheriaChan If they're not sound of mind, contact their doctor, namely the prescribing physician. Better if an immediate family member does it. They'll likely need to be taken off of it or given it in a cocktail.

But always always always tell the doc when weird shit happens that shouldn't."
22,"@ExistentialEnso Do it! There's been a boom in queer authors the last few years reaching mainstream publishers, oddly enough (given reactions to queer books in libraries and schools across the US) especially in the Young Adult fiction area. Seems like a great time if you can find a good editor!"
23,"@ExistentialEnso My spouse and I have spent the last few months collecting fat stacks of queer fiction (mostly fantasy, some sci-fi, and a lil contemporary) if'n u want some recommendations! Like House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune is wonderfully heartwarming tale about found family."

27,"@damedoteth Seeing you in your position also convinced me it was okay to just be openly queer without being full anon, along with a plethora of the trans devs in this space, when I was trying to figure out where to start.

31,"@EtheriaChan Super convoluted plot, pretty much Butterfly Effect/Inception/Memento mashup with FF and Disney characters. Not as plot thicc as Drakengard/Nier Automata but fuckin close for a 'kids' game. Def recommend Birth by Sleep (best game imho, darker plot, good trio), KH1 and 2."

51,"@GRITCULT @ameensol @bitcoin4bernie Decentralization is also about reaching consensus, beit algorithmically or socially via governance. Yknow. Cause everyone's voice matters. Welcome to decentralization.

If this bothers you, you're not ready for mass adoption. There's harder conversations to be had than this."
52,"@Nakamotolisk @ameensol I mean yeah but my biases are things like I don't like ketchup and prefer bbq sauce, not rejecting fundamental pieces of people's humanities and identities."
53,"self care is knowing when to step away from twitter. I've been followed home from school by church vans (good ol Irish catholics) shoving mass pamphlets at me, I'm set for life on ""love the sinner"" hot takes.

54,"@ameensol @bitcoin4bernie Well here comes the political aspect of delegation voting. How many people delegate and forgot, what is web3 campaigning about to look like, etc. Honestly it's a tough question but it's gonna put governance mechanisms thru a social stress test. There's at least that positive."
55,"@ameensol Up to governance/delegatooors honestly. I think the point of open source is open dialog. I'm sure he doesn't think what he says is filled with the vitriol it carries, but that's kind of the running effort of that god ponzi. Package bigoted views in shiny pious righteousness."
56,@ameensol But that also ignores the political work done by this God ponzi that leads to legislation that directly impacts those social groups. Just because he's not actively pushing that rhetoric in web3 doesn't mean he doesn't carry those biases with him in meatspace politics.
