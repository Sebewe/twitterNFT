21,"@InsightRh Definitely. Two things to consider:
- Bots scale much faster than people, and we're onboarding way more bots than we are new people. 
- Not all friction is bad friction. For some, getting into your first project that then rugs may cause you to leave forever."
22,"@InsightRh For sure. There is no mechanism that solves every edge case and problem! You just hope each experiment leads us closer to a better, more scalable NFT ecosystem :)"

24,"@InsightRh Oh I'm not being prescriptive on %s or categories! I'm giving an example of what projects can decide to do. This is simply a tool, part of a long set of mechanisms to help bootstrap early ecosystems."
25,@InsightRh https://t.co/4pnhNQkhrx
26,"@InsightRh That is a very real risk that you'd balance out with moderation. 

For example, out of a 10k project, one possibility:
- 30% allocated to any wallet, but you need to first go through a free NFT security class
- 50% to allow listed wallets via community
- 20% to high hodler scores"
27,And @BrennerSpear is building something here https://t.co/0g8J3aJI95
28,@BrennerSpear That is right! How did I forget @BrennerSpear
29,"And we can write contracts that allow list different categories with different mint limits, so you can balance giving newbies access while still maintaining a health community."
30,"We need on-chain verifiable wallet scoring. 

Enables artists/projects to allow list wallets that have:
- gone through an NFT security class
- been active with NFTs for more than 3 months
- been holding a top tier NFT
- not engaged in excessive flip behavior"
31,@V1Zhual 💎👋 aka the “@richerd index”

46,"@joshqharris Oh yeah for sure. I think more experienced investors avoid (or can yolo) but it’s the newer folks that get caught up and lose $.

I’m a huge proponent of building — and sorry it came across as non-supportive of that. 

But you know, “great power”…”great responsibility” etc etc"
47,"@joshqharris I’ve made a lot of assumptions based on your original tweet ofc, so let me know if those are wrong. 

The biggest concern I have is aiming to make a collection “go viral” after 24 hours of building and the origination not from the team that will carry it long term."
48,@joshqharris I hope people / teams that launch NFT collections stick with it long-term. Projects that are built by an third party team (ie not sticking around) and “go viral” have a high likelihood the average collector.

You sound very passionate on this topic and I respect that. Maybe we can have a call to discuss? Or just consider it differing opinions."
51,"@ethereumdegen @PopWonderNFT @DrifterShoots Isn't the point here the entirety of the argument around artist choice?

You compare a future custodian making a decision for a piece of history VS an artist making a decision around his art. It's treating the art more as an object of value rather than an expression of the artist"
52,"@ethereumdegen @PopWonderNFT @DrifterShoots WMVG collectors have gotten access to Drift's edition work, his Nifty Gateway releases, and in the future much more of his life journey.

You get there from being part of the journey, not holding out because you're trying to close some arbitrage."
53,"@ethereumdegen @PopWonderNFT @DrifterShoots This is a tough statement to agree with, because it shows so little faith in the artist's ability to bring value to collectors. The follow up tweet treats every piece as a commodity.

If Drift stopped working today and if each piece were the same, then you would be 100% correct."
54,@yungwknd @ethereumdegen @PopWonderNFT @DrifterShoots 💯
55,"@ethereumdegen @yungwknd @PopWonderNFT @DrifterShoots You're absolutely right. Artists are not in control of their tokens. They control journey of their art, and what the future of their art looks like. 

And it isn't black and white, just as @muratpak makes creations that ask us to question the nature of ownership and creation."
56,"@ethereumdegen @PopWonderNFT @DrifterShoots I'm not here to speak for Drift, and FWIW there's been regular discussion. I'm just speaking from my own opinions on this topic. 

Personally I think wrapping is great for collectibles, I think it's not a strong statement for art. Regardless it is however a choice by the artist."
57,"@ethereumdegen @PopWonderNFT @DrifterShoots Sure, and again -- I get that. I'm sure there are collectors that feel that way, just as I'm sure the best artists are saying to their collectors: ""Trust me and my art""."
58,"@ethereumdegen @PopWonderNFT @DrifterShoots Ultimately the discussion around losing the peg on a collection treats the artwork as commodity - that there would be collectors that disregard the intention of the artist, in search of value from holding the last few pieces that aren't migrated."
59,"@ethereumdegen @PopWonderNFT @DrifterShoots Nothing but respect for you @ethereumdegen. 

I think the question here is artist choice. And the choice here is one made around ownership. If it were a temporary measure, nothing would be risked -- and the act of wrapping it would make the ownership decision almost meaningless."
