Shouldn't it be just ""Tweets"" and ""Replies""?

Maybe there is a UX reason 🤔?"

2,"@gocholive Estos son el tipo de cosas que deberían ser automáticas a través de un smart contract sin intervención de Sky Mavis. 

Debería ser la comunidad eligiendo a su creador favorito, y si este cumple con los votos requeridos por el Smart Contract, automáticamente se le da el código."
3,"@gocholive Eso me parece más justo, que la comunidad pueda votar por su creador favorito y que a este se le dé un código. Si la cantidad de votos es mayor a X numero, sky mavis debe darle el código a esa persona. Me parece una buena estrategia."
4,"@gocholive Aunque si te pones a ver, un código usado significaría que una jugador nuevo entro a Axie. En teoría no estás dañando la comunidad, la estás haciendo crecer. 

Ejemplo, yo tengo mucho tiempo en Axie, y no soy influencer, pero si he traído a varias personas al mundo Axie."
5,"@gocholive Entiendo. Si, todo esto se puede tornar un poco conflictivo porque si se escogen los creadores a dedo, Axie será “Corrupto”, pero si se deja libre (que todo el mundo tenga su código) puede pasar lo que dices."
6,"@gocholive Yo no estoy de acuerdo con el aumento de la tarifa, pero si me gusta la idea de los códigos de creador. 

Podrías explicar por qué no estás de acuerdo con darle códigos de creador a algunas personas?"

55,"That's it for today friends! 

Leave a like if you found it interesting  ❤️

Happy coding  😉"
56,"So, the key takeaway here is to:

1. Check if our function calls or tasks depend on each other.
2. If they don't, let them be called/executed first and then ""await"" for the data.

Concurrent &gt; Sequential."
57,"Taking into account that both calls take 10 seconds to complete...

By doing it in this way, it will achieve us that getOrderStats() will return its data in roughly 10 seconds vs the 20 seconds it would take if we had to do it the other way."
58,"Here, we are calling both getUserStats() and getOrderStats() without one waiting for the other.

So, both functions are going to fetch their respective stats practically at the same time.

Then, we ""await"" for their data."
59,"We definitely can do this by not ""awaiting"" for getUserStats() immediately (making concurrent calls):

Solution: https://t.co/LIt86iByeb"
60,"If getUserStats() takes 10 seconds to resolve.
And getOrderStats() takes 10 seconds to resolve.

Total time for getStats() to return its value = 20 seconds (10 sec + 10 sec).

What if we make that getOrderStats() doesn't wait for getUserStats() 🤔 ?"
61,"If the call to getUserStats() takes 30 seconds, getOrderStats() needs to wait 30 seconds before it starts fetching the order stats, which is not ideal because user stats don't depend on order stats."
62,"But, even by not depending on each other (theoretically), we are creating a dependency.

By calling AND awaiting for getUserStats(), we are making getOrderStats() depending on getUserStats() without realizing it."
63,"In this second example, we have getUserStats() and getOrderStats().

If we think about it for a moment, userStats and orderStats are two completely different things that fetch different data that don't depend on each other."
64,"But, there are cases where functions don't depend on each other and they can be called without one waiting for the other.

So, let's get back to the first code snippet of the thread: https://t.co/safXkqlevD"
65,"In this case, we have two async functions: createUser() and createOrder().

createOrder() needs a user to in order to function properly, so we can say that createOrder() depends on createUser() to be called and resolved first."
66,"All of us have been in a situation where we need to make wait for multiple promises to receive data we need to make something.

Take this as an example: https://t.co/JbPZouNPT1"
