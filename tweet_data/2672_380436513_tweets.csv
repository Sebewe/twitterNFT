88,"@lauren_zb there’s so much more offer in terms of giving you access to a community that might be giving back to something that you’re passionate about, connecting with likeminded people etc I think there are too many headlines that focus on how much a crypto bro has made by flipping an NFT"
89,@lauren_zb that’s totally a perspective that I understand! I believe in the tech behind smart contracts and definitely think we’ll start seeing NFTs be much more than just art. I also think that there’s a misunderstanding around it being an investment just for the sake of making $$$
