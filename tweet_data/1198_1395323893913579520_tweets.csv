46,@claggs_eth Man has too much money and needs help
47,@bec_eth @Pixelmon :( no moving out
48,@Howard27836449 @Pixelmon NFT space is unpredictable :(
49,@Michaelccfd @Pixelmon I hope so. WLs don’t do good these days :(
50,This was 100% my mistake but I told people not to buy @Pixelmon and then fomo-Ed 10 min before mint. I gambled with rent money and now it’s gone. Ended up postponing moving out. Huge lesson learnt for me personally- and I hope it’s a reminder to everyone else
51,So is syber doxxed or what? We need a police agency to chase aft the guy who took millions of dollars and delivered this lmao ill just write off my losses
52,"10/ Like seriously, this is just AMA alpha you won't get on their site etc, everyone at the AMA was sold and Grant is just an amazing speaker. Just hella honest. fully doxxed. btw ps5 and console are compatible.🔥 ??!! https://t.co/EtiHzIZhbB"
53,"9/ They have plans to do tournaments and all that as well which will boost marketing. They've also partnered with the 'steam' of blockchain gaming, and they can't reveal who yet but have already hooked up with illuvium. 👀They are going to be the first FPS featured there 🔥"
54,"8/ Weapons is going to be a good thing. You wanna be better at the game, you wanna get weapons. The tokens which will be used to upgrade the weapons are going to be in demand. NFT will get you those, with the tokens. Free players can still play the game, but now they want the NFT https://t.co/9w1GApROti"
55,"7/ Grant, founder (who also absolutely killed the AMA) said candidly that it doesn't make sense  for everything to be on-chain. It adds security risk, and gas. Now there's gasless armory, vault, and the lending program"
56,"6/ So, you're sick of the game? You can lend it out. Yeah, typical you've heard of lending programs - but now the cool thing is that someone asked about gas fees/ onchain things affecting the smoothness of the game https://t.co/poG8KFNXbp"
57,"5/ Obviously, he says if you wanted you would go play COD and Valorant etc, but why not play a similar game which is Undead Blocks if you get to earn money anyway? There are also 3 modes, and if you wanna, can play with your friends. Have a pizza party,play together, cover pizza$"
58,"4/ To earn tokens, you play the game. You saw the game trailer and it looks great. You essentially earn money playing a game that's not gonna have the token go to 0. Now, the founder has been extremely transparent ' THIS IS NOT THE MOST FUN GAME OUT THERE' https://t.co/0PDeLLL1G6"
59,"3/ pockets for $ZBUX. The stablecoin essentially solves the 'who gets left bag holding problem because now its pegged to 0.10. There is also massive utility to both coins, which makes it valuable. You essentially won't be buying into the game only to mint and flip"
60,2/ First off - the one thing I'm so bullish on. They have a dual-token ecosystem. $ZBUX is pegged to $0.10 from the get go and Undead Blocks says that they operate like an 'insurance company'. NFT royalties from Undeadblocks will go back into the treasury and not the team's https://t.co/KmPAOezZDa
61,"1/ FYI the game play video is not even just some blender type of teaser, that's actual gameplay of the beta version and should be more than enough to tell you that it's not some noob game, or that the team is actually going to take eons after mint to develop."
62,"I hosted the AMA for @UndeadBlocks and let's just say i have never been this bullish. Check my thread below for why 🧵 - including some extra info from AMA
