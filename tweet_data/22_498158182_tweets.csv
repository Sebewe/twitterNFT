If you are an nft project and think that Station can help enable your community, my dms are always open :).

1,"I feel that using @0xstation is the first step for nft projects to empower their communities to run their own initiatives which can eventually lead to these media-empires that @janehk originally suggested.

16/x

https://t.co/EsidCCvl2T"
2,"For @tombilyeu and @impact_theory, this would help community managers broadcast all of the initiatives proposed by the community to have a better overview of which ones are ongoing.

15/x https://t.co/2PX0AbswAf"
3,"For @starcatchers, the team would be able to publish the ""alpha proposal"" initiative, and community members would be able to start applying for it.

Using endorsements, the core team would be able to signal which community member they want to onboard.

14/x https://t.co/GkKWkH1Kko"
4,"For @Doodles, if ever @austin_hurwitz needed project managers or maybe translators for his proposal, he'd be able to signal this as well.

Same thing for @0xshub's LearnJPEG project.

13/x https://t.co/P4DJQFQMKr"
5,"Similarly, once the @bobubeanfarmer DAO is launched, the community will be able to publish the initiatives that are currently being worked on and require help from other bobu token holders.

12/x https://t.co/ShnG5DF33H"
6,"For @AzukiZen, we'd be able to see @iFlaxson's [REDACTED] project as well as any music project that is on-going.

If @iFlaxson was looking for help, he'd also be able to broadcast it through the [REDACTED] initiative.

11/x https://t.co/ILmBikO5s2"
7,"Core members and designated community members would also be able to use endorsements to signal the talent/candidate they want to vouch for. 

This could help project leads make better decisions on who they 
want to onboard to their project.

8,"Using our Initiative Board, communities will be able to publish on-going initiatives and designate which ones are looking for help.

9,"This is why I'm super excited for what we've been building at @0xstation as I believe this could help out a lot of nft projects solve this exact issue.

8/x"
10,"The problem I'm seeing is that there is not a good solution out there that provides visibility of all the community-led initiatives and if they require help.

As we've all experienced, Discord is good for sync messages but terrible for organization and coordination.

7/x"
11,"Finally, there's also @TomBilyeu's @impact_theory that has a community initiatives channel where members can either post a project they are working on for the community or ask for contributors to help their project.

6/x"
12,"@StarcatchersNFT created an alpha proposal channel that will be eventually expanded to community members who want to volunteer and share projects.

5/x"
13,"In @doodles, they have a forum where members can submit proposals to the community.

@austin_hurwitz recently made a proposal to send 100ETH for Ukrainian Humanitarian Relief.

@0xshub also made a proposal to build LearnJPEG, an NFT education platform.

4/x"
14,"Azuki is also leading the biggest community-led experiment through the @bobubeanfarmer fractionalization.

This will also create a bunch of new proposals and initiatives that other beans will be able to help manage. 

Ex: Bobu's Beans (a potential coffee brand).

3/x"
15,"First, let's start with a few examples of community-led projects:

In @AzukiZen, @iFlexson is currently working with a few other community members on [REDACTED].

There are also musician channels where fellow beans help each other out and create music together.

2/x"
16,"*disclaimer* 

I want to mention that I own most of the projects I'll be mentioning and that I'm also a contributor at Station, so my opinion could be biased.

Now that's out of the way, let's get back to thread."
17,"Community members want to help out because they not only have a *sense* of ownership but have actual ownership in these projects.

But, as @janehk mentions, the tools to support these initiatives are lacking, which I believe @0xstation helps solve.

19,@LoganOP_gm Im down to chat whenever!!
20,@andrwwang is this alpha ser?? 👀👀👀
21,"Kinda interesting that every big brand is partnering up with nft projects to enter the space.

Nike x RTFKT (acquired)
Adidas x BAYC/Punks Comics
Puma x Cool Cats/Gutter Cats/Lazy Lions

Who's next?"
22,"@kolahonn gm! 

Hope you are well rested and had a fun vacay ✨"

24,"@angelaliu22 Im so sorry for the spam. Never type out metam*sk in it's entirely if not you'll get spammed (lesson learned the hard way).

Yeah I feel just because I use metamask so frequently, it probably doesn't make sense for me to switch even though it's so laggy 😭"
25,@angelaliu22 Forgot about the metam*sk bots lol
26,"@angelaliu22 Any issues with wallets (i.e metamask) on Safari or other chrome extensions?

Been trying to find a way to have 20 tabs open without having my computer get stuck every few hours 😅"
27,@sonofalli Now imagine when you’re 30 😩😩😩
28,"Ok I have to call this out.

Twitter account created yesterday, no website, no discord, using Azuki as signalling while we dont even know who is behind the project.

Was interested at first, but won’t mint because nothing more screams “cash grab” than this. https://t.co/WA3NnPuypM"
29,"Something I've been thinking recently is how important it is to have an opinion/thesis on nft projects that you buy into.

Doing this is scary because you'll often be wrong, but when you're right, you're gonna be very right. https://t.co/cAOPZAHQ0w"
30,"Feels pretty good to see that Azuki has maintained it's 50%+ unique owners and has only 12% listed right now.

Still not as low as other projects such as BAYC, Doodles, CC and CloneX, but a lot better than when they started.

Floor however, has gone up significantly ;).

IKZ! https://t.co/TDKeAtPtF7"

33,"Loved this thread by @InsightRh on the @GENESIS_SENSHI project.

Most threads I create discuss only the positive side of projects.

I like that he also made sure to highlight some criticism while still remaining bullish. Just shows how he wants to remain as objective as possible. https://t.co/KdJM66SrJ7"
34,"We have to start making this the norm.

90% of the time teams don’t stick to a roadmap. 

It happens in web2 companies and wouldn’t change for nft projects either. https://t.co/gaWE6z7qFX"
35,"@lylemckeany @bigheadhq @staringispolite Thanks for sharing! 

Parallel’s issue wasn’t the gas, just mainly that there was a lot of hype and demand so the site just crashed. 

Would love to hear from @staringispolite if he has any good ideas on how to solve this!"

Being home alone doing market research for nft projects and @0xstation while browsing which other @StarcatchersNFT I should buy next ☺️"
40,"Is there anything that web3 teams can do to prevent bots from destroying their sites?

If websites can do it for sneaker releases, surely we can do the same for nft mints, no? 

This is no fud. I'm actually curious."

88,"@0xMagik Don’t think this is controversial at all though. 

Most merch released by nft projects have always been for all, but has little advantages for holders such limited edition merch or just a few hours more to shop prior to public launch."
