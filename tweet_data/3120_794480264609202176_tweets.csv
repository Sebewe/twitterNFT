26,"@d1460_nft I think it's beautiful - tho I think it works better for B/W than for color. Did a B/W print once on Baryta &amp; I really liked the outcome. 

Haven't tried Baryta yet on colour because I was happy with Pearl so far. Maybe I gotta try it at some point. ;)"
27,@d1460_nft Love using Hahnemühle Fine Art Pearl as default paper for my prints - it has a fine glowy coating &amp; was my favorite when I tested all the different HM papers. :)
