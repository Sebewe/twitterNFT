75,"@Hantao from the article:

""For transactions that involve a creator code, the Community Treasury will receive 4.25%, while 1% will be shared with the creator. For transactions that don’t involve the creator code, the Community Treasury will receive the full 5.25% fee."""
76,"@Nashs_Axie_Farm @AxieInfinity agree with you, wish we could vote!"
77,"14/

P.S. 

300000 players will be earn AXS for the Arena leaderboard this season. Over time, AXS ownership will dramatically increase within the community as we unleash AXS rewards through various game modes.

If you aren't an owner of Axie Infinity yet, that's ok."
78,"13/

As a final note I think marketplace fee is a subject that should be determined by governance once that is enabled.

The marketplace fee can be adjusted again in the future and as always, if we find a better solution and source of funds for this, we can adjust."
79,"12/

As always, thanks for the awesome feedback so far. We will continue to assess the impact of this update on the ecosystem in the months to come. Stay tuned for more details on how to get involved with the Creator program!"
80,"11/

The data below shows that 5.25% is well in-line for the NFT space. + the fee in most of these examples are going to the core developers/marketplace owners rather than the community.

Remember, the Community Treasury belongs to the Axie community. It belongs to all of us. https://t.co/wzZcI50Isg"
81,"10/

Can the ecosystem sustain a 1% increase in the marketplace fee to pay for this program and does this new fee put the Axie marketplace at a level of fees outside the norm for an NFT project?"
82,"9/

Higher volume and use of the creator code could have created a massive and unsustainable bill or forced us to somehow put an upper level limit on the program.

There were similar related options that all suffered from the same basic limitations."
83,"8/

Could Sky Mavis have paid for this out of pocket? Perhaps, but only for a limited period of time and this could be variable based on marketplace volume."
84,"7/

Using the Community Treasury to fund this did not feel right and is something that I personally believe is should be voted on. We don’t have voting functionality right now so this was not an option."
85,"6/

The money to pay for this program needs to come from somewhere and it needs to be sustainable. It can’t be paid for by a one-off subsidy."
86,"5/

Ok, so now we understand why the creator code was necessary.

Why did we raise the marketplace fee to pay for it?"
87,"4/

The creator code offers a new path where creators can earn their keep in the ecosystem based on their measurable impact.

This is a path towards sustainability for creators to focus on Axie and Ronin related content without having to sell out or take sponsorships."
88,"3/

However, creators have been driving a lot of growth but their main way of capturing this value has been by either buying their own stake in the ecosystem or by selling out and promoting other projects."
89,"2/

First, it’s important to state that our creators are a key pillar of our community. They create so much value by making educational and cultural content that makes the game more fun and rewarding for the entire community."

There’s been some interesting discussion and feedback around raising the Marketplace fee to 5.25%. This is an important decision that will affect everyone in the ecosystem.
