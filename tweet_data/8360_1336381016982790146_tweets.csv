3,"Thinking of sharing invoices, bank statements, and proof of payment from all the funds we’ve made from NFTs and spent on game development aside from what’s on the blockchain.

In a sea of fake ass projects feel this could help people recognize how rare and real @PlayColony is."

8,"@schoboat I agree. It’s eye opening though when you really look at the type of rug pulls that are being pulled off and the type of buyers coming in really just looking to flip.

I feel like it won’t last much longer but at the very least I genuinely believe @PlayColony is in a safe spot."

Gives such a bad look to the space. Honestly devalues real projects just by being in the same industry."

14,"I feel 90% of “successful” NFT projects are slow rugs or have become “blue chips” through wash trades and market manipulation.

The more I see, the more I realize I don’t fuck with half the ppl in the NFT space. Lotta fake shit going on.

Seems rare to be building something real."
