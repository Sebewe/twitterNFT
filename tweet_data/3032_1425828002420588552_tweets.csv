5,"end/ 🙇 finally i'd like to thank you the previous owner of punk#6227

105Ξ is a steal for this lovely lady 🥰 

💰 my offer to buy any 🟦🟥 3D punks at 120Ξ still stands. dm me and i'll make offer for your punks on-chain.

https://t.co/IkpJc3cXUN https://t.co/DSabp3sCur"
6,"12/ now let's recap

⭐️ wealthy people buy arts
⭐️ punk is similar to $BTC as store of value
⭐️ punk owners aren't buying to sell which makes it even better than $BTC
⭐️ you simply can't be in crypto without some cool pfp 

punk is THE holy grail asset for crypto citizen"
7,"11/ this characteristic of not buying to sell is found in multiple luxury brands

🔑 it's the KEY contributing factor of why they retain &amp; multiply in value

case in point, patek phillipe has a great motto for the brand https://t.co/SoU8oP9ngT"
8,"10/ however, the most important thing isn't in all those reasons above

📈 it's simply the fact that most punk owners aren't buying punks to sell, at least not in their generations

this is what differentiates punks from currencies like $BTC 

it's BETTER than bitcoin"
9,"9/ similar to how $BTC has managed to hold its market domination regardless of thousands of more advanced crypto being built

🤖 punk is the original art on-chain long before NFT is even a thing

let that sits in for a bit. it never gets old."
10,"8/ as the citizens of crypto realize more and more they need meanings beyond profits in this space, most will understand

💡 they'll realize sooner or later that what need is arts
💡 they'll realize not all arts are created equal
💡 they'll realize they need punks in their lives"
11,"7/ owning punks is THE answer

✅ punks are original, similar to how $BTC started (store of value)
✅ punks soothe your soul and mind. on bad days you can just stare at punks all day and everything will be fine
✅ punks are better for you than lambos - trust me, i've tried"
12,"6/ i believe citizens of crypto who's been in the space longer than 1-2 year are all tired of:

❌ chasing yields 👩‍🌾
❌ finding new gems 💎
❌ watching their portfolio 📉

life has more to offer than just the numbers everyone's been chasing

🥺 we need sth better than shitcoins"
13,"5/ the science of art collecting / buying / flipping has been studied for ages

a good read 👉 https://t.co/52GqM6uCwn"
14,"4/ 👬 wealthy individuals have strong desire to express themselves 👉 this often comes in form of ownership of luxury items to present as status symbol

maslow's theory supports this view. people's do whatever they can to feel connected (love) and gain status (self-esteem) https://t.co/sIEt4O2Vcj"
15,"3/ prices of contemporary arts have always been increasing, and will continue to increase and outpace inflation

🤔why? my hypothesis is that as time goes the number of people who're well-off financially and stable in life will increase, especially in crypto

they'll turn to art https://t.co/Fjpmv5wROp"
16,"2/ throughout modern history, arts have been an integral part of mankind's evolutions

from van gogh's ⭐️🌜 starry night to andy warhol's 🥫🍅campbell soup, the iconic arts from each era represents what's important to people

🖼 arts = window to human history"
