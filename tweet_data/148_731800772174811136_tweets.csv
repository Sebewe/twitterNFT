these people have 0 interest in community, innovation, or grassroots movements.

been receiving so much love and kind comments lately but it’s triggered my social anxiety and terrible imposter syndrome, it’s an ongoing journey

31,"@Loopifyyy @3LAU @KosherPlug @AntonymNFT @x0rart @HYPEBEAST Also the same thoughts. A digital copy of the physical isn’t enough, you need an inbuilt way of authenticating the physical products connected to the digital. But when digital changes hands and the physical doesn’t? Who owns the product anymore.
