0,"IMO no one wants to ""own their data"". 

People want financial upside, convenience, security, delight etc. Anyone building web3 products to help people own their data needs to ask how they help people get what they really want. Human needs and problems don't change much."
1,@cdixon How do you think about the perverse incentive this creates for users to game usage metrics to try and extract ownership out of the network without contributing value? And the resulting inability of builders to accurately measure product-market fit.
2,@FurqanR 👋🏽👋🏽

4,"@dwr 💯

Onboard them first. Allow them to connect a wallet later, or spin one up for them if they don’t have one."
5,@pzakin Could argue the exact opposite too: user-owned networks attract speculators who try to game metrics to extract ownership without contributing value. It’s a double edged sword and I’m torn. Want to believe the optimistic story but evidence supports the pessimistic one so far.
6,"@BrendanEich @AcquiredFM @1Password @Web3Auth Totally. Hard to predict end state, easier to make incremental improvements. 

I’m a fan of Torus. We’re working on building something better (we think) along those lines"
7,"@BrendanEich @AcquiredFM @1Password Do you think people needing to secure their life’s savings with a piece of paper stored in a safe is the future of money?

To me that seems like a step backwards, not a step forwards. Especially when the tech exists to allow self-custody without storing seeds (secure MPC)"
8,"@BrendanEich @AcquiredFM @1Password I hear you - passwords backed by passwords is turtles all the way down. 

I tend to agree that auth app is enough, but then wouldn’t you agree that auth app + memorable pw is Pareto better?

Regardless, my initial point was that seeds will go away and be replaced by secure MPC"
9,"@BrendanEich @AcquiredFM @1Password What about the password you use to login to 1password or your Apple Macbook? Eventually your unmemorable passwords boil down to something you KNOW right?

Seed phrases are security by what-you-have, which we already have - authenticator apps on your phone."
10,"Heard @BrendanEich on the @AcquiredFM say that seed phrases are like the new passwords. 

I think this is the wrong mental model bcz pws are something you KNOW but seeds are something you HAVE. Most ppl can't remember a seed. 

IMO seeds will go obsolete.

Great episode overall!"

15,"@AmitMukherjee @GradyTeske Yeah. I would add that “what is” is up to us to shape. We don’t have to play by others’ playbooks if we have different goals, which in my case is long-term impact and value creation"
16,@GradyTeske @AmitMukherjee Early liquidity is part of the problem here. It makes playing long term games quite difficult and promotes short-termism. Big things that affect the world in positive ways don’t happen with short term mindsets. https://t.co/OXhmvYFRje
17,@AmitMukherjee Shouldn’t investors hold a long term mindset and have conviction *until* something fundamental changes? As opposed to a short term mindset from the beginning?
18,(11/11) I remain long-term bullish on web3 because the underlying ideas &amp; principles are powerful and worth pursuing. But we're currently stuck in local optima and need to recognize it + question assumptions that got us here. https://t.co/Lmckhl8Q7r
19,(10/11) History suggests that debt and money-printing-driven euphoric booms are usually followed by busts. The extravagant parties at NFT NYC/Art Basel etc. are clear signs of euphoria. I don't think this bust will be as bad as 2018. But it will clear out the chaff.
20,(9/11) Worth noting that the $BTC narrative is somewhat different from the web3 narrative. It has no fundamentals but is the OG technology and has proven to be lindy as a store of value.
21,"(8/11) The role of VC cannot be ignored here. VC's primary goal is to generate returns. When there's an opportunity to pump prices based on narrative, get early liquidity and dump on retail without regulatory oversight - that opportunity will be taken."
22,"(7/11) Fundamentals = business models that are not dependent on people buying a token so they can sell it to a greater fool at a higher price. Some call these ponzis. I prefer ""lack of fundamentals"". Either way, most web3 projects today lack fundamentals."
23,"(6/11) It's no surprise then that most web3 companies with true fundamentals don't have a token, because they don't need one. They recognize the value of illiquidity for long-term thinking. And they remember the YC motto - build something people want."
24,"(5/11) Similarly user adoption is driven largely by speculative behavior, not based on actual utility of products. As a builder, when users are gaming your metrics to get an airdrop, this distorts the signal you get from them and makes it harder to build something useful."
25,"(4/11) In traditional company-building - founders, employees and investors have no liquidity for 10 years in the best case. I used to think this is a bug, but now believe this is more a feature. It forces a long-term mindset and focus on value-creation."
26,"(3/11) The ability to drop a token and ""go public"" earlier in existence has created bad incentives for builders, users and investors. All are incentivized to hype/pump projects and attract speculators that they can dump on. None are incentivized for long-term value creation."
27,"(2/11) Most of them have unsustainable business models and non-existent fundamentals. The ones with real business models are more centralized, picks-and-shovels type - exchanges (Coinbase/FTX/OpenSea), developer infra (Alchemy), L1s and some DeFi protocols."
28,"(1/11) An upcoming crypto bear market is both inevitable and healthy for the long-term success of web3. A massive amount of money ($13 Trillion) was printed by the fed over the last 2 years. This has caused unsustainable overvaluation among early-stage startups, protocols &amp; NFTs."
29,@0xJ010 Possibly. Or they will turn people away from the space when they get burned.
30,"@0xJ010 IMO should be 0.

Netflix is entertainment, travel is entertainment. 

Buying memecoins is pure speculation driven by fed money printing zero interest rates"
31,"Memecoins with large market caps are a gross misallocation of capital. They're a bug, not a feature of the cryptoeconomy.

$SHIB and $DOGE have a combined mcap of &gt;$30B. Imagine if a fraction of that could be allocated to productive uses. Accredited investor laws partly to blame"
32,"Tokens are like grease in a car's engine. They can make the car go faster and smoother. But it's the car doing the moving, not the grease.

Value comes from creating products and services people want, not from dropping a token."
33,"@saxena_puru @BahamaBen9 This is the wrong takeaway. Social media network effects are some of the most powerful in the world. FB did not get ~3B daily active users by accident.

IMO correct takeaway is ""Moats can be eroded over time"""
34,"@AmitMukherjee Twitter is definitely not the best place to look for reasonable, constructive criticism.

But separating the vitriol from the substance, much of the criticism is warranted IMO"
35,"Web3 needs to listen to its critics and address valid criticisms instead of getting stuck in a wagmi echo-chamber

It's important to seek out and engage opinions/evidence that contradict your beliefs, not confirm them. Makes us all better"

38,"If you think $ARKK is overvalued, speculative tech, wait till you see seed-stage web3 startup valuations"
39,"@the_carlosdp Think it's important to separate positive v/s normative statements. 

I tend to agree that decentralized shared state is better than centralized (as long as performance is equally good)

But just because its better doesn't mean it'll play out that way"
40,"@the_carlosdp 1. Shared state does not necessarily need to be built on decentralized infra (see Solana). It just needs to be trusted. Is decentralized shared state better? Maybe. I'm 60/40

2. If providers don't like an RPC method and the market wants it, the market will create a new provider"
41,"@BobbySchmueller @the_carlosdp Not sure if impossible, but probably worse, and probably unnecessary!"
42,"@the_carlosdp Why not?

You can have multiple ""centralized"" technology providers built on shared state"
43,"Web3 has been critiqued because Alchemy, OpenSea and Coinbase are ""centralized"".

What matters is decentralization of power, NOT decentralization of technology/infrastructure. 

These cos are less powerful than web2 cos because of the user's ability to exit. Can't do that with fb"
44,"An under-appreciated driver of crypto/web3 is the $13 Trillion $ that has been printed since Mar 2020.
