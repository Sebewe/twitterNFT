75,👆If in Russia or Ukraine seems best bet is to convert as much money as possible into crypto but not financial advice.  If you go to Poland or America that crypto should hold the same value even if your currency locally crumbles.
76,In Russia the Ruble is going to lose value tremendously &amp; citizens who are against the war still lose that value for their money. If crypto was held instead of government backed currency the value would remain no matter what happens globally. #crypto #RussiaUkraineConflict #war
