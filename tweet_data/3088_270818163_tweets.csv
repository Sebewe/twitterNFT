65,@watashiarc @opensea I still have a few. If you want I'm willing to swap the one you bought with any of the ones I have left.
66,"@watashiarc @opensea I listed it high on purpose thinking the floor would pump a bit. This explains why it was bought up when the floor was so much lower.

I didn't bother to refresh metadata as I saw all the traits using the traitsniper extension."
67,"@convalytics @ABCDract @Loopifyyy I guess besides the cancel, the initial call to Opensea to approve a collection for transferring is also a write to the blockchain, but I wouldn't call that a listing. Thanks for posting that thread though! I'll look into seeing if there's any way listing data that can be pulled."
68,"@convalytics @ABCDract @Loopifyyy How can it be on the blockchain if you don't actually use gas to write to it? The only thing that gets pushed to the blockchain, as far as I know, is the cancel which invalidates the signature."
69,"@convalytics @ABCDract @Loopifyyy Rarible is just pulling listings data with valid signatures from OS's API and not their contract.

Looks like some of these recent cases may not even have listings on Rarible which means listing data was completely dropped from their API."
70,"@convalytics @ABCDract @Loopifyyy Listing data isn't stored on the ""ETH Blockchain"". These signatures that validate an order are generated by you and stored on OS's servers / DB."

72,"Listing for this hidden listing created using OS's order contract still doesn't show up in the newly ""inactive"" tab that OS just created. 👀 https://t.co/VRRKBOK8AV"
73,@jasvault @opensea A bug that hasn't been fixed with the way they pull listing data.
74,@jasvault @opensea The default on OS used to be 6 months
75,@digitalartchick @jasvault @ToastVirtual @opensea @BoredApeYC Yup and it can happen even if you never transferred out https://t.co/VRRKBOK8AV
76,"@Loans0x @opensea Yeah, I got rekt.  Trying to be as loud as I can so others don't have to go through it."
77,"@Loans0x @opensea Also, the listing isn't expired. They just don't show it in their UI."
78,@Loans0x @opensea I believe it's because they read and store listing data off-chain. Somehow all my listings got dropped one day from the servers / UI one day.
79,"For people that still don't understand the bug and feel like it's not an @Opensea issue. Listing was created on OS and no transfers were made to cancel.

NOT purchasable on OS:https://t.co/Jv4ZVMZmEA
Purchasable on Rarible: https://t.co/M5vEb7h1Xe"
80,"Actually, it's not even close to being decentralized."
81,@uponlyy I was explaining it calmly. Just wanted to explain the fact that Opensea using the blockchain for certain things doesn't rid them of responsibility.
82,"Opensea can definitely do something. They make 2% off all our transactions. Don't just roll over and say ""it's the blockchain"" because it's not. 

Opesnea is not completely decentralized"
83,green light as in pedestrian walk light
84,"No, it's a design flaw. This is like saying ""oh don't walk in front of cars because you can get killed"". The light turns green and you walk out and get hit by a car. 

Is the person that gets hit by the car at fault? https://t.co/AusrKF00nS"
85,"@Loans0x @Rodge_NFT @Loopifyyy @opensea @doodles It's only partially fixed. The main issue is that they read listing data from a centralized DB

I have a few listings created on OS that are purchasable on Rarible but not on OpenSea. This issue extends further than just transferring to cancel."
86,RT @Rodge_NFT: Gutted to be affected by the @opensea listing bug on my @doodles today. I bought doodle 8893 2 months ago and had it listed…
87,"@uponlyy @Rodge_NFT @opensea @doodles People need to stop saying it's not OS's fault. Just because they use the ETH blockchain as a public database does not rid them of fault.

There are design flaws as well as functionality flaws of their system that need to be addressed."
