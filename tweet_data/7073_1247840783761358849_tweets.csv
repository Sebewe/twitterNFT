5,"@CryptoSmooths Well, people always wait for influencers to tell them what to buy, and so far the influencers are focused on other things. We have to grind it out our own way."
6,@KillItKellz @SpaceCowboysNFT Lovely! ✅
7,"@TakeoffTone We surely do at @SpaceCowboysNFT 

You’re basically free to do whatever you want with any Space Cowboy you own"

18,RT @ausballin: Charmin fellow isn’t he? Definitely getting French vibes @OGCaptainSteel @saelorxb @SpaceCowboysNFT https://t.co/Q8nbjWG0jG
19,@ausballin Looks like his name is Pierre
20,@SwervoTrader Contract wasn’t vulnerable. We gave out the first few mints for free. You got 20. I guess it’s too much to expect you to be grateful and actually want us to succeed. But that’s okay. This is NFT Twitter innit?
21,@j1mmyeth Could have minted some @SpaceCowboysNFT instead. Just 0.02 ETH and definitely not a scam. https://t.co/DcmTSRohy5
22,@TookbyJonathan @SpaceCowboysNFT But I have built mobile games with a very little budget so why wouldn’t we deliver now with a community and a larger budget? Is it a bad thing to dream big?
23,@negamav @itstylersays @SpaceCowboysNFT @GutterCatGang @BoredGutterApes This guy gets it! Yeehaw!
24,"@TookbyJonathan @SpaceCowboysNFT All these links are readily displayed on our Twitter and our discord. Since you say because they’re not on our website then we are rug, we’ve instructed a dev to put those buttons on the home page now. Not a rug anymore eh? 🤠"
25,"@TookbyJonathan Why would I buy my Twitter account? Lol I’ve been trading NFTs for a while, my man. Our Twitter is @SpaceCowboysNFT and our discord is &gt;&gt; https://t.co/X7q1PdKw3E
Come vibe with us and you could like our vibe. Here’s our OpenSea &gt; https://t.co/hLFUq2Vu3P"
26,@jennifer_sutto @SpaceCowboysNFT That’s not even fair. You didn’t even give a second to review what we are building and you are making blanket statements like this. Twitter Outrage Police at its best. We have spent months working on this to deliver good value to our holders. “Cash grab”??? Lol wow
27,"@EasyNameX @jennifer_sutto @itstylersays @SpaceCowboysNFT Just like 3D glasses, vapes, and a taped mouth, these are classic NFT traits across several collections that we paid homage to. Just our way of showing that we love projects that came before us and would love to continue in that tradition."

36,@macomoroni Facts. At @SpaceCowboysNFT we debated doing a 5k drop to build buzz but it wasn’t going to achieve our community goals. So we have to slug it out with a 10k collection.
