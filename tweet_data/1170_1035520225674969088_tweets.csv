5,"@NFTCulture temporarily bad for the market, for sure. Also bad for those projects long term and a bad precedent to set. It's setting the market up to be exploited as opposed to participated in. Also, any royalties for a collectible project over 3% (not including OS) are just way too sus."

31,"@wsavas Yea, let’s go!"
32,"@BT @Pyrish325 @DrBitstein Agreed, there should always be civil discussion. No doubt your project can &amp; should succeed from this point forward and you still have reason to congratulate yourself on top of lessons learned. My main points are mostly at the other partners who also bear responsibilities"

37,"@DrBitstein @slywalrus1 @BT @GoGalaGames at 90% discount from the original and 10x magnitude less than ""the original valuation"" you said he felt was appropriate. Yes, the free market spoke. If he was properly advised, he would know this is entirely reasonable and expected, and happens in Art Blocks all the time"

40,"@DrBitstein @BT @GoGalaGames then he's a fool and deserves this experience as its clearly the market loudly rejecting his beliefs in regards to pricing. Completely outrageous 11.11 e 3,333 collection, is he the third coming of Art Jesus?"

43,"@CrazyRyuKun @GoGalaGames yes 💯💯 i didn't know what people were expecting, including the artist, the price was unseemly and unprecedented in all the wrong ways for what it was"

46,"@browntopink because those scammers know you are quite smart and will never fall for it, whereas we are quite stupid. Disclosure: i applied to all the 500,000 eth giveaways with my seedphrase, sadly haven't heard back yet"
47,@browntopink what's the link!
48,"not to mention a completely unnecessary and poorly-thought out partnership with ""888"" who delivers such little value and is being accused of questionable unseemly behavoir. Totally inappropriate partnership and someone should be held accountable at Gala Games"
49,"Gala Games @GoGalaGames should feel disgrace and embarrassed for having associated their brand name to such a foolish &amp; immature drop as this recent orbs experience. 11.11 e DA for a blob collectible at 3,333 supply is daylight robbery and rediculous on its face"
