5,"@BillSeitz @RobertHaisfield @tomcritchlow @flancian @clarityteams great question. there isn't a public directory of bases. we would need base owners to opt-into make their base discoverable in order to do that.

are you looking for anything specific?"

50,@vgr cool! appreciate the context and openness. i'll chat with some of our other DAO partners who are using Gnosis Chain and can reach out for your input on the spec when we have one.
51,"@vgr @viamirror yep, it can still work in Clarity, but you'll need to specify the specific Token IDs within the overall contract.

we support both ""all Token IDs within this contract"" and ""only [these] Token IDs within this contract"". https://t.co/a1rA5x1fmO"
52,@provenauthority @j4ckdamon happy to read drafts if helpful!
53,"@vgr we're happy to add support if we have customers who will use it. it seems like Gnosis/xDAI is becoming the favorite chain for operations, which is right in our area of focus. i would happily scope this out with you--we're very collaborative."
54,"@vgr @viamirror good news: the OS listing shows the contract ID

bad news: it seems like your contract ID is the same as other Mirror Editions projects bc it's the same Mirror contract 😕

59,@VicKalchev could be rolling/open ended funds ?
60,@divine_economy dude i have the same problem with these new @ecodao_ x @whoisbrux nfts
61,"@nnnnicholas @awkweb if off-chain actions are primary in your app, then SI should be primary.

on OS, on-chain actions (bids/buys) are primary so you connect, but then you need to SI to take off-chain actions like editing your profile.

2/2"
62,"@nnnnicholas @awkweb good point. C and SI both require you to Sign on-chain actions.

SI lets you take off-chain CRUD actions that do not require signature.

so i think the distinction in UX is more about on-chain v off-chain actions than it is Connect vs Sign-in

1/2"
63,@awkweb @signinwitheth this is awesome! 🔥
64,"@nnnnicholas @awkweb i think SI is accurate if you are authenticating a traditional web session. the wallet signature is playing the role of a password, similar to oauth.

siwe is a standard for the flow of signing a nonce and how that’s implemented. since everyone was doing it differently."
65,"@BryanPetes @divine_economy @provenauthority yeah @provenauthority put me on, and it’s been coming up in conversations more often. h/t to our call yesterday."
66,"@awkweb @nnnnicholas the engineer in me wants to be very clear about the distinction, but the designer in me says “the user wants to see the content/use the app and we just need to give them a button to do that”

and honestly i change my mind between the two all the time."
67,"@divine_economy yeah this is why we need more conversation around on-chain v off-chain reputation.

68,@jorndegen @spengrah @clarityteams @singularityhack sweet! let's chat about it. i'll send a dm
69,@balOShere looks like another point for tim apple 😅
70,"@BrantlyMillegan i would say “full vs lite”, then include the technical terms and feature diff in an info hover. similar to what you showed yesterday.

i think your decision as Full for default has the biggest impact on UX. love it."
71,@balOShere works this way on macOS https://t.co/rgWUazcOEm
72,"@FonsMans so dope. love that the S works as the mark

the S has a fun retro vibe, but still feels at home amongst the serif

this gives it a groovy 80s feel that is still somehow fresh and new."
73,"@byAnhtho @ljin18 great point, this is a common issue with plug-ins or extensions that try to token gate content. they don’t have full control.

you can do full token-gated documents on @clarityteams because its built-in rather than a plug-in.

plus, we’re 🍊 !"

76,"@adylon7 @ljin18 check out @signinwitheth . it’s a community supported standard. apps that implement it can check for nfts and other on-chain assets to grant access.

we were the first to implement it in @clarityteams

77,"@spengrah @clarityteams sweet, i'll dm!"
78,@BrantlyMillegan @ensdesigner @signinwitheth sweet! can't wait :)
79,"@BrantlyMillegan @ensdesigner @signinwitheth realized i was a bit unclear above.

my assumption is that *the persona who would opt-out* has an a priori preference for dApps.

so they mostly know why they would want to do that and are looking for it. you just need to inform them of the feature trade-offs."
80,@zen_bacon @clarityteams gee in that case i sure hope it's executed well :)
81,"@BrantlyMillegan @ensdesigner @signinwitheth the difference here is that opting out is framed as a ""pro-level"" decision that can be safely ignored by casual users."
82,"@BrantlyMillegan @ensdesigner @signinwitheth got it. if you're going Full mode by default, then the toggle could be framed as an ""opt-out"", citing the technical difference between the two as a benefit with less features as a trade-off.

my assumption is that this persona has an a priori preference for dApps."
83,"@BrantlyMillegan @ensdesigner @signinwitheth I love the idea to support tiers like this. UX-wise, this design may force a decision too far from the impact. I don't know if I value those additional features yet.

Could use Lite by default, and then prompt an upgrade to Full when I try to use those features in-app."
84,"@spengrah @clarityteams great question!

trad plan bills for all members, but not guests. 

but DAO plan is not seat-per-month so is unaffected

DAO plan isn't public yet. we've been working with DAOs to design the most aligned model and have been upgrading by hand.

i'd welcome a chat about it :)"
85,"this is exciting 🔥

i would love an HN for DAOs. it would be so much better to view a ""front page"" for the ecosystem than scrolling twitter for crumbs everyday.
