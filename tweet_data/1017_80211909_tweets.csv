2,"Here's a technical deep dive on recent events, from our CTO: https://t.co/2x2CBBCNtY"
3,"While the attacker stopped &gt;4 hours ago, our investigation is ongoing. We’ll keep you updated as we learn more about the exact nature of the phishing attack. If you have specific information that could be useful, please DM @opensea_support."
4,We’re actively working with users whose items were stolen to narrow down a set of common websites that they interacted with that might have been responsible for the malicious signatures. Huge thanks to the users that hopped on the phone with us directly.
5,Clicking on our site banner is also not a vector for the attack.
6,Using the listing migration tool on OpenSea to migrate listings to the new Wyvern 2.3 contract is not a vector for the attack.
7,"Minting, buying, selling, or listing items using https://t.co/TYuT1WACso is not a vector for the attack. In particular, signing the new smart contract (the Wyvern 2.3 contract) is not a vector for the attack."
8,"Interaction with an OpenSea email is not a vector for attack. In fact, we are not aware of any of the affected users receiving or clicking links in suspicious emails."
9,This attack did not originate on https://t.co/TYuT1WACso.
10,"We have confidence that this was a phishing attack. We don’t know where the phishing occurred, but we’ve been able to rule out a number of things based on our conversations with the 32 affected users. Specifically:"
11,"Another update: over the last few hours we’ve talked to dozens of people, teams, and projects across the NFT space. https://t.co/fB5r3cMA1r"
12,"Importantly, rumors that this was a $200 million hack are false. The attacker has $1.7 million of ETH in his wallet from selling some of the stolen NFTs."
13,"@EmilyAnne_AI Just ETH, as far as we can tell"
14,"If you are concerned and want to protect yourself, you can un-approve access to your NFT collection https://t.co/ifHod9EZZT"
15,"For more technical context, this thread (https://t.co/oHGgA3wLHP) is consistent with our current internal understanding."
16,"If you are an affected user, please DM @opensea_support so that we can thoroughly investigate — we’d love your help."
17,Always double check that you are interacting with https://t.co/GKLwAgML2x in your browser when you sign messages.
18,"We are not aware of any recent phishing emails that have been sent to users, but at this time we do not know which website was tricking users into maliciously signing messages."
19,The attack doesn’t appear to be active at this point — we haven’t seen any malicious activity from the attacker’s account in 2 hours. Some of the NFTs have been returned.
20,"As far as we can tell, this is a phishing attack. We don’t believe it’s connected to the OpenSea website. It appears 32 users thus far have signed a malicious payload from an attacker, and some of their NFTs were stolen."
21,"I know you’re all worried. We’re running an all hands on deck investigation, but I want to take a minute to share the facts as I see them:"

28,"@NadavAHollander is going to be joining as OpenSea’s new CTO, and @xanderatallah will step into a new, externally facing role where he’ll oversee our web3 and NFT ecosystem development efforts."
29,"Ultimately, we believe this union will be a force multiplier for NFTs and web3 adoption, and help us dramatically improve the experience of buying, minting, and selling NFTs on OpenSea — whether you’re a beginner, or a pro."
30,We share a vision that NFTs will be the cultural focal point of crypto’s adoption for years to come — and that vision can only be realized if it becomes easy &amp; delightful for the average person to use NFTs.
31,"@NadavAHollander, @brendan_dharma and the entire @Dharma_HQ team are among the most talented consumer crypto teams in the world."
32,"I’m happy to finally share that we’ve acquired @Dharma_HQ to help us scale our engineering, product and customer support! https://t.co/NnJdSFBzvo"

35,"If you thought 2021 was the ""year of the NFT"", 2022 is going to blow your mind.

We're so excited to keep building for this ecosystem. https://t.co/l8pDBsJ3II"
36,"It has been an unbelievable year. Thank you to the NFT community whose belief and tenacity has turned NFTs into an enduring force. It’s still so early, and I’m so excited to build alongside all of you."
37,"7/ In the last weeks of the year, we responded to community feedback on an array of small but powerful UX improvements: dark mode, connected socials, the collections tab, and the new photography category."
38,"6/ Speaking of, the OS team shipped huge improvements to our experience: we launched a mobile app for iOS and android, added support for additional chains, improved our trust &amp; safety practices, and started scaling our customer support team (more to come in 2022)"
39,"5/ Thousands of people participated in @NFT_NYC  https://t.co/crBz2PHCL4, a moment of arrival for the NFT space. It was surreal to see so much of the community in one place. And it was particularly fun for me to see most of the OS team in person for a change!"
40,"4/ We loved working with teams from @protocollabs, @ensdomains, @moonpay, @AlchemyPlatform and more to expand the NFT ecosystem. And it expanded: by Q3 the NFT space exceeded $10B in transaction volume, and OpenSea broke into the Alexa top 250 companies by traffic."
41,"3/ We saw a host of creators, artists, makers, and athletes advance the NFT space, bringing their talent, creativity, and energy with them. Beeple, 3Lau, Shawn Mendes, Christie's, Adobe, the Golden State Warriors and so many more."
42,"2/ The number and diversity of NFT projects grew exponentially. From virtual worlds to generative art, there was a Cambrian explosion of innovation. And the design space is still so underexplored!"
43,"1/ SNL explained NFTs to the world and listed their first NFT. We also took a stab at explaining NFTs but tbh Pete Davidson and the SNL crew probably win this round.
