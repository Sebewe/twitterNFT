16,"@CumbieroEth for contested names, whose txn gets mined first and therefore gets the name is determined by who pays the highest gas fee, so it's still an auction, just one that requires technical skill, lots of money, an opaque process, and all the money goes to miners (instead of the DAO)"
17,@CumbieroEth do you have alternative proposal for how newly released names that multiple people want should be distributed if not by who pays the most for them?
18,"@avsa that's why the default selected would be Full mode / Sign in, but for those who care they can just toggle to Lite mode / connected only"
19,@avsa lite mode is what the current ENS manager is. we want to also offer an option for people to sign in to a server so we can provide additional features that aren't possible if you're connected-only

23,"something ive learned from working on SIWE the last 8 months and then recently sharing our idea to offer multiple user states in the ENS manager is that there's massive confusion, among users and devs, what the terms ""connect"" and ""sign in"" mean, that they are different, and how"
24,"@yogicodes @avsa not with Full mode, the point of full mode is they are stored on our server (and hence can't be lost to cleared cache or changing devices)"
25,@WPMonty connect-only isn't read-only
26,"@Harrison_Kav that's what Full and Lite are (also, just to be clear, connect-only isn't read-only aka view)"
27,"@avsa with Lite mode, it's just normal wallet connect, they don't sign in to our server. they have fewer features but don't have to connect to our server, plus a forked version of the app will work without our servers"

41,RT @pedrouid: @ensdesigner @signinwitheth We are making SIWE a default built-in into WalletConnect v2.0 protoco
42,"@austingriffith @dannyryan also I think you misunderstand SIWE, its just a standard for authenticating with an ethereum private key that can used it any context in which that's necessary (could be a non crypto service)"
43,"@austingriffith @dannyryan so, this pops up if you click Sign in at the top right. if you visit the manager, nothing is prompted and you can browse in read only without connecting or inputing anything"
44,@yogicodes @austingriffith I still don't understand what you're proposing. lite mode is normal connect to submit txns for registering and editing names
45,"@austingriffith @dannyryan not sure what you mean, that's not what we're proposing with the ENS manager"
46,@TaylorGerring @austingriffith that's not what this is. read only is also available and doesn't require anything
47,@austingriffith I don't understand what you're proposing here

52,"@hishboy the closest we have to that is two options, injected provider (for browser extensions and mobile browsers) and wallet connect (mobile wallets). I only said three above because coinbase has their own connect protocol called wallet link, and they are big enough to also include"
53,@ryanalex_eth @ensdesigner @balajis @signinwitheth not sure what you mean

55,"@mg @ensdesigner @signinwitheth only way ultimately is to put it in the wild and see what ppl do. no matter what we do initially, I expect we will learn and improve over time. things don't have to be perfect right from the beginning in order to try them"
56,"@hishboy you're talking wallet choices? 4 is actually far less than most interfaces, and I don't see any way to get it down to less than maybe 3 given how wallets work. I'm any event, most users won't bother with the toggle (leave it on the default full mode) and just click their wallet"

58,"@ImFlub yep, this is how our current draft designs are"
59,"@BogDrakonov eh maybe, also longer. nicer to be clean"
60,"@sohrab takes more space, and also makes the decision required, whereas our design combines it and makes full mode default with no additional clicks, and only requires a decision to use lite mode"
61,@0xSoulFlex Full can have tons of good features but requires signing in to our server. Lite doesn't require signing in anywhere and still has the basic core functionality. different users will want either option
62,@admljhnsn read-only is neither of those and will also be offered (you just don't connect or sign in)
63,@willisxchung any proposals?
64,@MrRoflWaffles @ethleaderboard ah. you should just get another permutation. you might never get milo.eth but you still need a web3 username
65,@fabiogiolito Lite mode you don't connected to our server and have fewer features as a result. Full mode you connect to our server and have more features

69,"tech terms make it clear exactly how you're connecting, which you may care about if you know what it means. other users might only care about feature implications. I tend towards the latter, what you can do w/ it rather than what you're doing, but I'm interested in what ppl think"
70,"If the ENS manager app offered both a basic connected-only state and a signed-in state for additional features, should we refer to them with literal technic terms re how you are connected (Connected-only vs Signed-in) or the functional implications for features (Full vs Lite)"

74,"@mg @ensdesigner @signinwitheth because putting it into the same connect/sign in module is logically where it would go, and regarding it being a unique pattern yes we are trying to create a new pattern that hasnt existed before"
75,"@mg @ensdesigner @signinwitheth if you use lite mode, then that's how it would work. but having full mode available at this stage is much simpler if you already know that's what you want, some of the benefits can't be easily prompted to sign in, &amp; most users will just want full mode anyway"
76,"@JonRamvi @pedrouid @ensdesigner @signinwitheth definitely not a clear intent to me that you want to sign-in to a server, most dapps you don't"
77,"@Tomasswolf1 @danielgothits no names are reserved, ENS is decentralized"
78,"@pedrouid @ensdesigner @signinwitheth full mode will be selected by default, but you don't think some ppl want to be able to use the app without signing in to our server?"
