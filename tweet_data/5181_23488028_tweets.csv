1,i have a student frantically trying to make a deadline for her research submission. as she copied and pasted a figure into her manuscript i said “in nft world that’s called ‘copy pasta’” …she said “for a second my copy pasta wasnt working” 😂

25,@funghibull @winnynft is it true that your aunt’s husband’s stepsister in law’s best friend’s father’s  3rd cousin twice removed is actually mark cuban &amp; you have been allowing him to run NFT fantasy league under the pseudonym “funghibull” which he rents from you? ::shoves microphone in your face::

37,"how can you claim the moral high ground when you align yourself with  either party within a system that retains its power and influence through genocide (concealed as humanitarianism) ? did we “save” libya ? actually they are still in civil war, to this day."

44,instead it should have been controversial to let pharmaceutical corporations acquire so much power to begin with. but this is america; truly it is a plutocracy .
45,it shouldn’t be controversial to be against big pharmaceutical corporations having a monopoly over our freedom .
46,@eSatisfire i’d follow you again for this one if they let me. freedom is paramount. suffering and fear being leveraged to control people is not cool . and since when are the masses fine with all this power in hands of big pharma?
