0,To all the newcomers in the NFT space… something to keep in mind❤️ https://t.co/jmfcADnBdk
1,Happy birthday @randizuckerberg !! 🎉 You’re leaving an incredible mark on the Web 3 world and I can’t wait to see what you and @debsoon continue doing with @thehugxyz
2,excited to see future #NFT use cases by different podcast creators
3,"This! 🙌 Used to plan and build ideas around a roadmap, but our project was always evolving with us https://t.co/rsrS5n6YK4"
4,@Corso52 gm gm! ☀️
5,Really inspired and hopeful about the @reli3fxyz initiative... sending lots of love 💛💙
6,Some of the stories I will be sharing along the way are also very personal... so I'm hoping it'll help you get to know me more as a co-founder of @AmbodiXYZ but also inspire all of you to be more confident and to work on whatever makes you happy.
7,"Launching ""The Selformation Podcast"" 🎙️ tomorrow at 1pm GMT time! Posting an episode a week -- each episode will cover the different inner work/self concept messages behind the 1/1 art pieces I have created for my #NFT collection I am launching with @MatildaColman @AmbodiXYZ"
8,"The space definitely taught me to trust myself even when others keep telling me ""it's too risky"" or ""it makes no sense"", how to find my own balance, and being okay with not always being able to keep up. I also made some incredible friends through here... and that's invaluable"
9,It was exhausting to keep up with. We've seen some amazing creators like the @meta_angels team and @zaingaziani protect their community and team so they won't feel like they are on the verge of mental burnout. We want to be a part of changing this conversation too.
10,"Then I sold 1 VF, made some really good and questionable investing moves (but that's a story for another time), @MatildaColman and I decided we'd be doing 1/1 NFT pieces on Procreate... all while trying to juggle this with my other pre-existing commitments"
11,Started brainstorming ideas with @MatildaColman around late June/early July to see how we could bring #NFTs into our small business. The initial designs were animated trading cards.. so I learnt the basics of Adobe After Effects (which also changed a lot in a period of two weeks) https://t.co/8nWO8D3S6D
12,I definitely took a leap of confidence in myself and trusted my gut feeling... so I pulled the trigger and invested in 2 @veefriends in May 2021 (who remembers this crazy launch?! 😅) https://t.co/bdoBAwogfO
13,It's insane to think that it's been just over a year since I got involved in the #NFT space. I first learnt about NFTs after watching @garyvee talk about it (+ saw a few CH rooms on it). Here's how it has changed my life 🧵

19,"Re-launching my podcast some time this weekend 🎙More info coming soon — it’s going to be connected to my #NFT collection that I’m launching with @MatildaColman 👀

Been planning this for a while now. So excited to share this with you guys!"
20,@MatildaColman @IMBRAZEOFFICIAL Relatable ❤️🥰
21,"2/2 even if I wanted to give it my best, it wouldn't be my best since I wasn't energetically at my best. Beating myself about not helping @MatildaColman would also contradict the message behind our upcoming collection. Remember to take it easy on yourself today if you need it 💜"
22,"1/2 It's been a rocky 24 hours. I spent time prioritising some inner healing + being with people that make me smile. Nearly took it out on myself for not being able to work and help @MatildaColman yesterday with our upcoming #NFT launch, but I remembered that--"
23,@Corso52 Gotta make sure you hit 22 minutes and 22 seconds 👀
24,@Corso52 Did you go boxing for 22 minutes as well?
25,@Corso52 HAHAHAH legend
26,Added a @BossBeautiesNFT  in my collection! Been waiting for a while to find one that I absolutely love and this was it for me 🌸 https://t.co/luwwwusLAW
27,@kashviETH Awwww that's so wholesome 🥺
28,@debsoon @thehugxyz @randizuckerberg What an incredible story and journey Debbie!! 🤩 resonate deeply with all the lessons (especially Lesson 1 and 2)
29,@DCLBlogger This is so well worded!! Gonna be sharing this thread a lot to friends who prefer investing (in general) through data and numbers rather than just the culture or founders. Thank you!! 🙌🙏

35,"4/4: @charliemackesy posted “Happy Valentine’s Day” with the caption “to love in all its forms” on Instagram. That can be anyone, but don’t forget yourself too. To the person who gave me the book, I will always forever be grateful for everything you’ve done for me. Thank you. https://t.co/9zT6GQbQaL"
36,"3/4: Since the #NFT space moves so quickly, don’t forget to take it easy on yourself. Prioritize your inner world when you feel burnt out. Take time away from Twitter and Discord. Spend quality time with the people you love. There’s always time to check back in later on."
37,"2/4: Six months after doing a lot of inner work and healing, I decided to read the book again. This time there were tears in my eyes from realizing how far I’ve come from the person who didn’t have any self-love or self-awareness. https://t.co/nCw9Dch6Xl"
38,"1/4: When I first read “The Boy, The Mole, The Fox &amp; The Horse” 3 years ago, I was going through my version of rock bottom. A part of me felt like I was stuck, but reading this book was one of the few things that made me want to do better for myself &amp; the people I care about. https://t.co/HYvZ9Fyffs"
39,Wanted to post something a little different from #NFTs since it’s Valentine’s Day. So here’s a thread on one of the books that changed my life 📚👇:
40,"Got this beautiful piece from @amber_vittoria and love the little self-love reminder in the description 💎🌸

Happy Valentines Day everyone! https://t.co/R4qcGbA16c"
41,@Corso52 and boxing 👀
42,Couldn't be happier 🥺🙏 I absolutely adore this &amp; the description @AllysonDowney @aslanruby @acav @meta_angels https://t.co/CFVfp1duxz
