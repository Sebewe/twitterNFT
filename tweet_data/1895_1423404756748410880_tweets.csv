1,@OngoingStudy @ConvexFinance @Rocket_Pool The pool is live (factory 89) but very new and has fairly low liquidity since incentives aren't live yet. We are slowly scaling it up. It is safe to use as long as you deposit according to the pool's balance. It isn't going to be 50/50 rETH-wstETH but rather ~77/23.
