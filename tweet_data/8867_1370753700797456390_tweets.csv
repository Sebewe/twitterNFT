0,@SenTedCruz You don’t even know how supply and demand works. That’s sad.
1,@itskim_D Because I’m not looking at validation of my looks for likes or followers. I follow mfers for mfers.
2,"@SenTedCruz I just can’t with you anymore, Ted. You really do act like a petulant child on the playground. I honestly can’t determine if you’re really that much of an imbicile, or are you intentionally gaslighting us with misinformation. Which one is it?"

28,@SenTedCruz We’ve had enough of your absolutely dogsh*t rhetoric about Biden this and that. You’re such a terrible leader.

50,"@SenTedCruz We don’t need more police to stop shoplifting genius, we need to root cause it. Rising inflation and lack of wage increases caused by a global pandemic coupled with massive handouts to the wealthy. The wage gap has never been higher for top execs and their working class. 🤦🏼‍♂️"
51,@everydaymfer Sup
52,@BillionaireDAOs #Mfer @sartoshi_nft by far the most positive long term PFP you can invest in.
53,@SirRamboPhilthy @sartoshi_nft Nice cowboy there Mfer
54,@4jake @apemfers Agreed https://t.co/hTuGniByZP
55,"@SenTedCruz Spending on the needs of the American people, unlike the trillions given away to the ultra wealthy by your demigod. You really are in it for the gaslighting division despite you saying the contrary."
56,@xwwpp Would you say we have a…plethora of piñatas?
57,@WhipstheLatte Hey Mfer!
58,@wagmi__eth @sartoshi_nft Mfers fo sho.
59,@WSJmarkets As evidenced by todays hit piece…again. https://t.co/VpN4CgSxxc
60,"@heidiklum Indeed, but you need to get an Mfer. It’s the classiest PFP. @sartoshi_nft"
61,@letiskate And thennnnnn…
62,"@SenTedCruz Prices are higher because we printed trillions and gave it to the rich. Claim inflation is transitory and artificially jacked up the cost of living, as evidenced by farmers and ranchers not seeing a dime in contract improvements, but the sector sellers margins all increased."
63,@bielmike @SenTedCruz Naive to what exactly? The impending invasion of communists or the taking away of my guns? You’re the reason this country can’t advance and prosper. That’s ridiculous
64,"@bielmike @SenTedCruz You’re not serious right? China and Russia invade the US?!  What are you talking about take all the guns from the citizens? Nothing about his post suggest that, and it’s never happened. Again, absolutely ridiculous fear tactics."
65,"@WaqarSider @sartoshi_nft Jezus he’s gone off the rails! Wish I had the foresight in Dec. tried to mint, didn’t get. Let them cool off for too long and now I’ve only got 1. Shame on me. Great job mfer!"

70,"@SenTedCruz Defunding the police is such a fear tactic. We don’t need to spend an exorbitant amount of taxes on military and police, I would prefer education and healthcare. Your priorities are backwards."
71,"@willbehere Ahhh I just saw this reply! Now I’ve been called out. BRB, gotta get a 3D mfer."
72,@PhariseesHouse @joshbobrowsky Also my two favs. Nuclear are a great roadmap and true nerds with excellent art to support it. Of course Mfers are the GOAT and will be the NFT PFP standard.
73,"@SenTedCruz Let’s start with the insurrection that left them dead, shall we?"
74,"@Newenglandpiece I’m runnin’ out of of mfers to follow! I keep clicking … to find my only option is to unfollow. Guess I’ll unfollow, and follow again!"

78,@GoochieWay @apemfers Ape mfers are my favorite derivative of mfers.
79,"@SenTedCruz I’m sorry when have you ever tried to slow or stop crime? Putting up border walls is a joke. Crime comes from within. Again, what have you done personally while in office in the last 9 years?"
80,"@SenTedCruz Not even a month a log you chastised the administration for allegedly dividing Americans based on political views. Your efforts today are exactly that:gaslighting is with fiction. Stop being a dick, and start being a leader. No one likes a whiny puppet."

91,@WSJmarkets “Conspiracy theories”…why are they in the news every single day with some kind of paid article: “All of the investors sold so time to get out” fear tactic. Literally everyday. “Want 5 stock tips to invest in? We will recommend staying as far away from GS as you can”. Lol
