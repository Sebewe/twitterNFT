5,"5. To any stakers: you should start running a local execution layer (EL) client ahead of the Merge.

In the future, outsourcing this to third-party providers will open up stakers to slashing risk under the Proof of Custody game: https://t.co/C09C0HlJ8M https://t.co/lArUs3lHDa"

17,"4. The Merge/ Proof of Stake will not reduce fees on mainnet.

Smaller block/ slot times do increase available blockspace, but not significantly. Av. blockspace is only one input which influences fees, the other being demand

Near-term scaling &amp; lower fees will be on Layer 2s! https://t.co/3cOeu4B3qs"
