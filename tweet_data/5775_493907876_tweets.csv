7,"@Jarod40020 @DecentralGames @0xEthanDG @0xMiles @0xRyanDG @RaeonXO @NonFungibleGuys It's hard (nearly impossible) to mint a full set, and some really want full sets, so there's that. 

Also when a new set drops that tends to be the floor to sweep both for price and reason above. 

No desire to alter the floor and more about getting it for a deal, imo."
