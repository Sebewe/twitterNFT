4,@Wingerie Yes NFT’s in games is a tough topic. We don’t want games to turn into something you do for the money.
5,@Wingerie Haha it is indeed a wild west out there. And lot’s of stuff that is wrong or needs improvement. But just because it’s not perfect yet does not mean it’s just a den of scammers. I see a lot of potential.
6,"@mikker I'm not really good at consistently pushing through barriers.

3. Related to the above: I feel like I'm notoriously unproductive compared to others. If I put my mind to it I could really learn something new but instead I doomscroll.

Brb gonna look into microdosing for focus. ;)"
7,"@mikker Even when creating logo's I use other sources as inspiration. I learnt logo design by taking pointers from excising stuff out there.

2. I've tried to learn a bunch of skills in the past but always gave up. Calligraphy, realistic sketching, mastering Figma, playing guitar, etc."
8,"@mikker Dude you are too kind.

Think there's a few things holding me back:

1. I can collaborate and give feedback, and got a keen eye for design. But I’m terrible at coming up with stuff from scratch. I can only do it partially in the confined area of logo design."
