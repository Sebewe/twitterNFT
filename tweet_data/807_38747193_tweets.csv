58,"@mattimus_crypto @robtswthrayguns @flobots @KjSawka @SpeakerHeadsNFT @SpottieWiFi that’s simply not true on my end, I tweeted about it multiple times, retweeted every single relevant tweet of theirs, had the promo banner they designed in my twitter header for weeks and I even donated one of my own NFTs to the project so they could run a giveaway with it"
59,"@robtswthrayguns @flobots @KjSawka @SpeakerHeadsNFT @SpottieWiFi @abana_music @muxmool Yeah maybe I should have done more to help steer it too, I was just so busy with Synthopia and my album at the time that I just didn’t have the bandwidth to get properly involved or even pay close attention to anything else really😣 live and learn🙏"
60,"@robtswthrayguns @flobots @KjSawka @SpeakerHeadsNFT @SpottieWiFi Yeah that blows 😣 also, on the DSP side I thought they wanted too much however, so I asked to keep 50% of royalties there and they agreed, but yeah, it’s also very true that I wouldn’t have agreed to a deal like that if I was still struggling financially, that’s for sure"
61,"@robtswthrayguns @flobots @KjSawka @SpeakerHeadsNFT @SpottieWiFi Yeah I feel where you’re coming from, but I saw there was gonna be a bunch of artists on the lineup which meant a lot of people need to get paid and I felt like agreeing to 75% sold out was also my way of helping out the project and everyone involved in case it doesn’t do well"
62,@robtswthrayguns @flobots @KjSawka @SpeakerHeadsNFT @SpottieWiFi I also suggested to them they should just relinquish the rights to the commited songs back to the artists so we can release them ourselves in any way we want to
63,"@robtswthrayguns @flobots @KjSawka @SpeakerHeadsNFT @SpottieWiFi Damn, sounds like you had a much better deal than me 😄 Personally I thought it was fair for me to not get paid if the project is not a success, I don’t really like the idea of making money off of a project that fails"
64,"@robtswthrayguns @flobots @KjSawka @SpeakerHeadsNFT @SpottieWiFi I mean different artists having different deals is not really that weird to me, same as at a music festival irl for example, but I feel like the one thing we all have in common here is that nobody got paid lol"
65,"@robtswthrayguns @flobots @KjSawka @SpeakerHeadsNFT @SpottieWiFi Not sure what kind of deal everyone else had but I was the headliner and my deal was that I get paid only if/once the project is 75% sold out, last I checked it wasn’t even 5% sold out lol 😅 I’m pretty sure this was a miss for everyone involved unfortunately 🤷‍♂️"
