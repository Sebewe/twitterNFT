3,5.) I know stuff like this happens but i never expected it to be me or happen at this level. All i ask is to spread the word and bring some awareness to the NFT community. We truly are all in this together and i wouldn’t want anyone else what I’ve gone through
4,"4.) This morning my housemate @yoodinis account lost my bored ape. Ive moved my account to one of my friends @lucacs and he has stored them in a wallet for now. (God bless him)

Etherscan if the Invisible Friends Transactions: 
https://t.co/ugts1KfB5g"
6,3.) On the second day one of my top 10% azukis was stolen and one of my invisible friends was stolen from me. My safety precautions for this were to transfer them to a new computer ( in this case my housemates computer ) and hard resetting my own personal computer.

Etherscan of the 5 Weth Transaction:
https://t.co/uybKsORNnA"
8,2.) On the first day I was completely drained of 7.6 Ethereum and 5 Weth from my metamask wallet. My safety precautions for this were to transfer my eth and valuable nfts to a new account
9,"1.) Ive been trading nfts for around 7 months now and have made a decent living off of it. Over the past 4 days ive been running through safety precautions to keep my nfts safe and each day something has happened

49,anytime anyone ever asks me wtf nfts are i compare them to buying sneakers for retail ( minting ) and selling them secondary on @stockx ( @opensea  ). its just too accurate and if u think flipping shoes is easy you could easily flip nfts at 10x the roi
