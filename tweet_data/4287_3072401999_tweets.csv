22,@dustintaylor_ I listened to part of it because it blacked out a few times probably because I didn’t have the app open.  I’ll need to download the app on iPad.  Phone low on memory.  The part I listened to sounded good.  You talked about needing some quiet time before people got up.

You can take a video or 70-200+ photos using the Polycam app and processing.  This 29 sec video  took me weeks. https://t.co/ReHBiyJntE
