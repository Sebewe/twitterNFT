54,@crypto_geo_ @10______4 @TheGree53716841 @gsscott26 @cryptomanran @RemindMe_OfThis I hope so… but remember your freedom is being taken away lol so probably not right ?
55,@ccnl598 @cryptomanran I’ll ask ppl that I know who are in Paris about the video. I’ve seen lots of videos like this over the years
56,@crypto_geo_ @10______4 @TheGree53716841 @gsscott26 @cryptomanran your “ freedom “ will be taken away and you won’t be on here in 5 years right ?
57,@crypto_geo_ @10______4 @TheGree53716841 @gsscott26 @cryptomanran @RemindMe_OfThis in 5 years
58,"@crypto_geo_ @10______4 @TheGree53716841 @gsscott26 @cryptomanran There’s no war lol

Lets follow up on this in 5 years? 

Stay well"
59,@crypto_geo_ @10______4 @TheGree53716841 @gsscott26 @cryptomanran I didn’t say I support anything you can assume whatever you want about me. 😊
60,"@ccnl598 @cryptomanran Yes and the media makes it seem worse than it is. Then you have people on social media lighting it up because they dislike the government, etc"
61,@crypto_geo_ @10______4 @TheGree53716841 @gsscott26 @cryptomanran You only care because it’s affecting you now. Before covid all of these issues existed thoughout the world. We’re you concerned then?
62,@ccnl598 @cryptomanran That’s the problem. Instead of being happy for someone and thinking in a positive way you rather talk shit. You will be a victim of the government for life with that mentality 👍
63,@crypto_geo_ @10______4 @TheGree53716841 @gsscott26 @cryptomanran Have you donated any of your crypto gains to help people who need it?
64,@TRexTinyarms @cryptomanran If you think the government has access to your crypto then you have a bigger problem lol

66,"@10______4 @TheGree53716841 @gsscott26 @crypto_geo_ @cryptomanran What about people in countries that don’t have access to medicine, flying, jobs, essential needs. We’re you ever concerned for them?"
67,"@StingerZ69 @cryptomanran The situation will get sorted, hopefully more change and Canada will still be one of the best countries to live in."
68,"@TheGree53716841 @gsscott26 @crypto_geo_ @cryptomanran We need change to better everyone not “ freedom “

Wearing a mask at certain places is not your freedom taken away."
69,"@crypto_geo_ @84thebuz @INDUHSTREET @cryptomanran You’re right, but it’s not the end of the world. People will be heard."
70,"@crypto_geo_ @84thebuz @INDUHSTREET @cryptomanran Time will tell. All I know this is nothing compared to that, it sucks in the short term but long term Canada will improve."
71,@84thebuz @Nft_NrD @INDUHSTREET @cryptomanran 💯💯
72,"@crypto_geo_ @84thebuz @INDUHSTREET @cryptomanran My Family came to Canada from Congo during a time of war, and most of them were killed. My opinion is from experience. I don’t care what the government says."
73,@crypto_geo_ @cryptomanran I don’t want the news or care because it’s all BS
74,"@INDUHSTREET @cryptomanran Good luck bro, I still been travelling and living life as usual."
