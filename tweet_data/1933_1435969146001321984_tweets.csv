6,"Blockchain protocols have already disrupted traditional industries, such as finance, supply operations, and more, but at their core, blockchain protocols will transform how humans organize themselves, connecting completely disparate individuals through DAOs."
7,"• https://t.co/oP7Y00glfK a decentralized voting system that supports various proposals and voting types to cater to the needs of DAOs.
• https://t.co/UuyYU9o76o a data analytics site for DAOs that provides governance and financial metrics."
8,"There are also a number of tools out there made for creating and coordinating DAOs:
• https://t.co/SWxJVptiGt a no-code platform for launching and running DAOs that is owned and operated by the community."
9,"• https://t.co/yBkmG2Rzgt a for-profit DAO made up of experts and experienced builders in the crypto space investing in Dapps.
• https://t.co/9vfrtYzxZ6 an AMM DAO where voting power and revenue share are weighted based on the duration token holders have remained invested."
10,"• https://t.co/RchcHTTmEH a digital employment DAO that offers payroll, employment benefits, and shared services for its members.
• https://t.co/BctqNrwLLl a play-to-earn gaming DAO that buys NFTs in games and onboards new gamers into blockchain-based economies."
11,"Here are some interesting DAOs to check out:
• https://t.co/PQKy9BxbAN a service-based DAO with a decentralized community of builders and designers who are available to work in the crypto space."
12,"This creates an elegant alignment of incentives – it is in the individual token holder’s best interest to only vote for proposals that serve the collective DAO’s best interest, and as the DAO succeeds, the tokens that each community member holds also increases in value."
13,"DAOs are managed by decentralized governance rather than a centralized team. Community members in a DAO who hold a certain amount of tokens can create proposals about the DAO’s future operations. For a proposal to pass, the entire community of token holders come together to vote."
14,"Even though we are only just at the early phases of experimentation, DAOs that live on a public blockchain are already proving to be more transparent and more globally accessible than traditional corporations 🧵"

17,"To get funding, your team and market opportunity must possess all of the elements of a good bet. This all starts with knowing that you’re investing your own time in a good bet. If not, why are you even working on your startup in the first place?"
18,"Depending on the stage of the startup, VCs will also apply different standards. A Pre-seed startup only needs to be a promising experiment worth funding to see how it turns out. Whereas a Series A startup needs to show the experiment worked."
19,"Lastly, think about why you’re doing this right now. Why hasn’t someone else already done this if it’s such a brilliant idea? Ideally, the explanation would be that it just recently became a good idea because something changed or no one else noticed."
20,"Most startups that achieve significant growth also do so because of a specific external trend that they’re riding, so know if you are in or moving into a market that is growing by default, as investors will be worried if you are in a market that is stagnating or shrinking."
21,"While founders see startups as ideas, investors view them as markets. Along with a strong team, a startup worth investing in must have a plausible path to capturing a sizable portion of a sizable market, as measured by TAM. This is the maximum size you could grow into eventually."
22,"Finally, you must know confidently and truthfully why you are working on this idea, why your startup is worth investing in, and what milestones you will achieve if you get funding."
23,"Once you have a team of founders that genuinely like one another and work well together, what matters most is determination and flexibility. You can’t be a team that gets demoralized easily since you’ll face a lot of tough challenges and you need to be ready to change your plans."
24,A good founding team usually has two or three domain experts who have a strong relationship. This is because building a startup with only one founder is too difficult and is a vote of no confidence.
25,"The most important component is the team. Most VCs decide if the founders are winners in the first few minutes they chat, and it’s difficult to change their minds once their opinion is set."
26,"VCs look for sufficiently good bets that have a chance of being very, very successful, and while doing so, they often put the heaviest weight on the team and market opportunity 🧵"

31,"With decentralized money, we will also need decentralized finance. DeFi not only allows more people who are excluded from traditional financial systems to have access to financial products, but will also allow quantum leaps in what’s possible with money."
32,"I’m quite taken by the idea of DeFi Dapps with rules that are not controlled by institutions and its employees but are based on faith in code. Clearly, many others share this faith, too, with more than $70B locked up in DeFi at the time of writing: https://t.co/H7bCZBSQKl."
33,• https://t.co/VAN4zkCOOk for receiving yield and rewards by staking your crypto; this lets you tap into higher returns than traditional financial products.
34,• https://t.co/XOyQipJn3d for exchanging one asset for another directly from your crypto wallet; this provides you with 24/7 open access to the market.
35,• https://t.co/pupCxYDMXS for taking out a loan or lending your crypto to earn interest on it; this protects your rights to participate in economic activity regardless of your background.
36,• https://t.co/xsTK3SKYpE for generating Dai whose price is stable with respect to the US dollar and is collateralized with crypto assets; this allows you to hedge against volatility.
37,"There are many DeFi Dapps that you can already try today:
• https://t.co/rLB7g4ntEa for self-custody of your crypto funds, digital assets, and data; this gives you complete ownership of what is yours."
38,"The breakthrough of DeFi Dapps are that they are powered by code written on decentralized technology, rather than being controlled by centralized infrastructure that is managed by authorities, institutions, and intermediaries like the traditional financial system."
39,"For the first time in history, you don’t need to be interviewed by a gatekeeping banker for a loan or fill out lengthy forms with personal information to trade on an exchange."
40,"Why use DeFi? DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is the paradigm shift from traditional financial systems (e.g. saving, borrowing, lending, trading, investing) to peer-to-peer finance that is automated and removes the middle man 🧵"
41,"It is vital for startups to choose the right metrics that can be used to measure success and for founders to choose what to do based on what will positively impact them. For further reading on these metrics, check out this fantastic article from @a16z: https://t.co/ztKi2hIbEe."

50,"What metrics do early-stage VCs want to see? Founders will typically present metrics that go with the industry vertical they’re in, but a better approach is to prepare metrics based on your startup’s business model. Below are 3-5 key metrics each for 8 common business models 🧵"
51,"If you’re like me and have always felt that you were born too late to get involved in the internet during its formative stages, this could be your opportunity."
52,"I see a similar pattern playing out with blockchains, where there will be better user experience, usability, and scalability over time. I truly believe that blockchains have the potential to reshape the world as the internet did."
53,"In 2011, Evan Spiegel took advantage of the iPhone’s camera and founded Snapchat for photo sharing. The reality is that no computer by itself solves any problems. It takes a while for smart people to try things out and innovate. After all, innovation is a multi-step process."
54,"When the iPhone was first released in 2007, it was incredibly expensive and slow. It had very few applications, but it came with a GPS and a camera. A few years later, in 2009, Travis Kalanick took advantage of the iPhone’s GPS and founded Uber for ride-hailing."
55,"What Problems Do Blockchains Solve?
New computers don’t need to immediately solve problems. Most existing computers don’t directly solve problems either. Instead, they unlock new capabilities and enable a design space for application-level entrepreneurs to solve problems."
56,"@alive_eth beautifully encapsulates Ethereum’s potential in one sentence, “for the first time, we have the ability to program trust.”"
57,"This lets applications built on Ethereum to be also open-source and self-policing like Bitcoin, executing correctly every time without the need for mediating authorities."
58,"Ethereum’s decentralized and collectively owned software guarantees that the applications deployed on top of it are also decentralized, collectively owned, and can make guarantees."
59,"Ethereum
Ethereum is a more complex blockchain computer. It unlocks third-party developer creativity by supporting a general-purpose programming language – Solidity, similar to how the iPhone has a programming language, Swift, that lets developers build iOS apps."
60,"Bitcoin was just the beginning, soon other people came along and realized that blockchain computers could guarantee more things than just money and transactions."
61,These guarantees make Bitcoin valuable like precious metals that are scarce in the natural world and perhaps even more credible than fiat money as governments can lower interest rates.
62,"Bitcoin’s decentralized and collectively owned software guarantees that there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins, there can’t be double-spending, and users can have genuine ownership of their Bitcoin."
63,"Bitcoin
Bitcoin is the simplest possible blockchain computer. Its whole stack is optimized for just one application – to be a global store of value, similar to how a Fitbit is made for just tracking exercise."
64,"Different from older computers like mainframes, personal computers, and smartphones, blockchains’ open-source and self-policing software guarantees that its code will continue to run as designed without relying on a centralized corporation 🧵"
65,"Growing your primary metric proves that you’re a valuable startup, one that is actually building something lots of customers want and reaching and serving all those customers."
66,"@paulg once wrote, “a startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of ‘exit.’ The only essential thing is growth."""
67,"A startup’s goal is simply to grow its primary metric, calculated by Growth Rate: Revenue or Active Users (Month 2) - Revenue or Active Users (Month 1) / Revenue or Active Users (Month 1) x 100. This is the one ratio founders should always know, and VCs will always ask for."
68,"In this case, you are measuring value delivered through customers spending their time on your product. This could be in the form of Monthly Active Users, Weekly Active Users, or Daily Active Users."
69,"Active Users are another primary metric, particularly for startups with marketplace business models (that need strong network effects) or advertising business models (that need a large audience before monetizing)."
70,"Nothing tells you more about delivering value than customers spending their hard-earned money on your product. Even better is if your product has recurring value to customers, like Monthly Recurring Revenue in Software-as-a-Service and subscription business models."
71,Revenue is the best primary metric for most startups because it can indicate and quantify how much customers really want what you’ve built.
72,"A primary metric is a quick way to determine how well a launched startup is doing. It is also the one metric that founders should focus their entire company on, and VCs want to know about when asking for growth rates. So what should you pick as your primary metric? 🧵"
73,RT @paulg: NFTs can be used for so many different things that you're inviting history to make a fool of you if you dismiss them. Even if I…
74,"“Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly.” – Vitalik"
75,"So what does this all mean? Hopefully, it means that we will end up in a world where users, creators, and developers have significantly more power than they do today by accumulating more value and having lower switching costs going from one network or platform to another."
76,"People can own, create, build, and fully enjoy the upside. Social networks and creator platforms become value networks through tokens like social tokens, collectibles, digital art, exclusive experiences, tickets, etc., that offer much better economics to creators and developers."
77,"In Web3, all of the revenue is given back to the users, creators, and developers as rent-seeking intermediaries are removed."
78,"• Web3 social networks like Diamond collect 0% of the revenue their users generate.
• Web3 creator platforms like Rally collect 0% of the revenue their creators earn.
• Web3 app stores like Ethereum collect 0% of the revenue their developers make."
79,"These take rates are unhealthy, as little to no revenue is shared with users, creators, and developers. But soon, more and more people will realize that they can opt out of the Web2 ad-based model and switch to Web3. Healthy take rates look something like this:"
80,"• Web2 social networks like Instagram collect 100% of the revenue their users generate.
• Web2 creator platforms like YouTube collect 50% of the revenue their creators earn.
• Web2 app stores like the Apple App Store collect 30% of the revenue their developers make."
81,"Simply put, take rates refer to the percentage fee that an intermediary collects from its users, creators, or developers. Let’s take a look at the take rates of centralized Web2 networks and platforms:"
82,"On most social networks and creator platforms that exist today, the only business model layered on top is advertising, where take rates are incredibly high, users become the product, and creators can only earn through promotions. But this does not always have to be the case 🧵"

86,"If a launch is successful, you will need to continue to launch new features and product lines. Just know that as a founder, you will never not be launching."
87,"Launching repeatedly and asking for feedback lets you see how people respond to your idea, pitch, and Minimum Viable Product, and gives you many opportunities to refine them."
88,"2. Sharing it to communities like: https://t.co/VrJej8tIsI, https://t.co/ZIfUQJ9DDG, https://t.co/soWIUqGnbb, Facebook groups, alumni groups, and popular blogs (that cover your industry)."
89,"You can start by: 
1. Building a landing page that has a: domain name, company name, short description, contact, and call to action (e.g. get in touch, subscribe, request access)."
90,"You shouldn’t think you only get one shot at launching your startup. Launching is something that founders should always be doing; it is not a point in time but rather a continuous process throughout a company’s lifecycle. So if you haven’t yet, put yourself out there! 🧵"
