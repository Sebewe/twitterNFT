8,@ChrisGentile_ a very convincing breakout candle innit 🤣👍
9,"@whaaat_happened No. I'll be deploying some contracts soon, so I always need to keep ETH in reserves. Besides, there's endless list of things that ETH can do and BTC cannot."
10,Last chance to buy $ETH under $3k?
11,@_JohnWhelan Probably less if you prioritize taking out the fuel supply lines first.

13,"@0xgokhan @intocryptoast @LizSly Welp, I've been looking at their propaganda for research purposes recently, and it's so very well done and believable that it's frightening. As they get cut off from the western world and turn inward, it's going to be extremely difficult to counter that. I only hope."
14,"@intocryptoast @LizSly The Korean War has been going on since 25 June 1950. There has been a ceasefire, but the war is not over. Probably that's what they mean by that, Ukraine will go into a stalemate?"

31,"@ForSureNotHere @nicksdjohnson Interesting. I see the votes cannot be changed once submitted too, (Is there any reason why snapshot votes cannot be changed, in case of a mistake or change of mind?)"
32,"@ForSureNotHere @nicksdjohnson as i understand, he hasn't cast the real vote yet, he just posted a vote on his personal space, which he uses to poll for sentiment before submitting an actual vote."
33,"@nicksdjohnson Not yet! Might be a good time to do now, is there some good info on how?"
34,@matthewegould You should focus on your own project instead of dunking on ENS.
35,"⚠️ all who are delegating your $ENS to me (tycoon.eth) are welcome to advise me on how to vote on the latest ENS snapshots, including EP6.1 👍
(I have a little conflict of interest in this matter, since Brantley renewed my .eth registration as an act of kindness in the past)"
36,"@matthewegould @spencecoin @MidwitMilhouse @unstoppableweb I'll probably consult with my delegates on how to vote on this one. I represent them, after all."

45,"@twobitidiot Exactly. I'm still waiting for the population to turn on Kim Jong Un, which despite having some of the toughest sanctions in the world, will likely never happen. (I think the Sunshine Policy is a far better strategy)"
46,"@MarkBeylin Why would you want to stop them? Wouldn't they be adding value? (And since they are holding the NFT, they would also be incentivised to play well for the collective brand as a whole)"
47,"@MarkBeylin look at my other replies, I think you are missing the point about why ""tragedy of the commons"" won't tend to happen 😉"
48,"This is my biggest concern with all the boycotts. Cutting off communications for ordinary Russian citizens will close them off even more, and lock them into their state controlled media, increasing their govt's grip. The free internet is their last pocket of democracy!!! https://t.co/5r6ZjpUhRS"
49,"@MarkBeylin 🖕 I think this a big ""aha"""
50,"@MarkBeylin Btw, I think the answer to that is they won't do it, because if they did, they know that it would immediately FUD their own investment. So the same principle goes for other NFTs owners too - they are incentivised to act in way that would not harm their investment."
51,"@MarkBeylin Yeah, that's always been a question in my mind. What if someone like Al-Kim Jong-Bin-Putin buys a CryptoPunk? Will this harm the punks? Obviously nobody can stop them..."
52,"@MarkBeylin Not really, look at open source software. Eg. Lots of projects under a MIT license, which basically has only 1 limit: the original author must be credited. 
Yet there are countless examples where open source is thriving, including Ethereum itself."

70,@coronav08481151 @KJJKETH Just wondering how did that happen? Was there a warning on the UI about the non-standard characters?
