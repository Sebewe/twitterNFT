Each card has had a new trait added to its metadata and rolled 🎲

Did you roll a Prismatic or…"
9,"And the resuuuuult iiiiis ...Oh eM Gee!!! Can't forget the bev! 

@ThePixlverse card variants are now live! You can see your rare cards RIGHT NOW in the Hatch UI!

You can ""Refresh Metadata"" in @OpenSea too, but please be patient as their updaters have been slow

I got a gold :) https://t.co/ZwbJwBMFH0"

31,"@Carolina4Crypto It’ll effectively be a waitlist system if you are in that latter group. 
You’ll only get the serum if the appropriate amount of people withdraw their tokens before you"
32,"@Carolina4Crypto But if 1000 people provide 2 ETH LP, the first 500 that stake the entire duration will actually get the serum. This is to ensure people don’t stake their SLP, withdraw early and then still get Guaranteed a serum"
33,"@Carolina4Crypto We’ll have a very clear UI for this.

The plan is to integrate as many in-app interfaces for our protocols as possible so users don’t have to go from site to site guessing on issues exactly like this."
34,@blade0x Yep. And a super short-sighted rug at that with all the crazy stuff we’re cookin up 👀
35,"@spicegirl_eth I was also recently (finally) diagnosed with ADHD. I can count the amount of books I’ve been able to sit down and fully read on my two hands.

Having a framework for these struggles were a huge help for me. Super happy to see you’re out here constantly killin it YOUR way 🙏🏽"
36,"@blade0x The allowlist for minters will be expanded as we create more smart contracts integrated into the ecosystem (staking, LP protocol, etc)

Admins minting random amounts of tokens would actively ruin our bags as investors in the project ourselves.

Def trust we won’t be doing that 😂"

45,@yesbazzy @wabdoteth The hackoooooor
46,"@GrinninGoatNFT @wabdoteth Sure, but where does the line get drawn if that token also has the image asset to use as the PFP?
Ideally this is solved by Pixseals, cuz I think Twitter will extend itself to support Polygon soon"
