97,@clonexbot sheeeesh
98,@yobsyobsyobs @wiss_wisss @LooksRareNFT I think we agree. The real problem is the clunky userexperience with transactions (not platform related) The current standards simply suck. We need change on the lowest levels. PSA: OS is the cause for many many people selling their assets at a fraction of the market value.
99,"@DynamicNFTLabs @wiss_wisss @yobsyobsyobs @LooksRareNFT The market will expand, more than enough space for multiple NFT marketplaces imo. They will crush nothing."
