1,"@terrelljstarr Luckily they are much, much rarer in real life."
2,@wongmjane Take care of yourself
3,@micsolana Proposal to change English -&gt; American 😤
4,@wongmjane Use offer code “invade” for 20% off.
5,@The_Nutrivore @DrPlantel The higher the LDL the more biohacking you’re doing.
6,"@kelseyhightower Past some sort of minimum, not really. I don’t really try to quantify myself in that way. Kinda a you can control the inputs not the outputs thing. Although wdym by “value”? Self worth? Perceived value to others?"
7,@dystopiabreaker Very relevant https://t.co/yBF8m4Id7a
8,@ContraPoints The real NFTs are the friends we made along the way.
9,@dystopiabreaker Perfectly balanced
10,@jamiepine Exercise gang 😤
11,@BrantlyMillegan @ethleaderboard Hello hello. Gonna flex on y’all with my 9 followers. Only half of those are follow bots 😎
12,@ParikPatelCFA To be fair in the future the US dollar will be backed by asscoin.
13,@jacksondame @wongmjane Do you ever feel like you don’t end up making connections with coworkers? One huge downside for me.
14,@BioLayne Us with the anime profile pics have been spared. 😤
15,@Noahpinion @js_thrill Writing well about rabbits**
16,@timrpeterson @altini_marco This is the one covering the issues with the HRV the health app reports. https://t.co/RghW9nlVKl
17,"@timrpeterson My understanding is that you have to be careful with HRV measurements collected _automatically_ from an Apple Watch as it seems to be done at random. There is a blog post from @altini_marco covering this. Also, do we know if HRV is _causal_ for better health?"
18,@jacksondame I hope the age old wisdom of “twitter is not real life” applies here. :(
19,@dan_abramov I always get my financial advice from a wine bottle that 30 seconds ago jumped off the balcony. :p
20,@kelseyhightower @LukeYoungblood There seem to be a lot of “no fun allowed” people in your replies…
21,@kelseyhightower @peter_szilagyi There is a table of current fees available at https://t.co/nzekZaqeM9.
22,@hubermanlab 1. Translation rates are too poor from 2 to 1 for me to be okay with 2.
23,@smsunarto I like how ENS went with delegation. I have no clue how nor do I care to govern a protocol.
24,@elonmusk @WorldAndScience More importantly it starts making memes
25,@jacksondame Ok now hear me out… web 4.20
26,@jacksondame Pretty sure I’d want to die if I listened to my city council meeting. 🪦
27,@jacksondame @mikedemarais CEOs should just be determined by twitter follows.
28,@kelseyhightower @ShenJiaYu Are you planning on looking into Ethereum (or any other smart contact platform)? Excited to hear your thoughts and criticisms!
29,@acemarke 99% of our sagas at work are basic data fetching 😢. The exception is I wrote a takeLatestUntil function that uses a couple things the other sagas don’t.
30,@kelseyhightower @theElontologist There are people working on making it so that users don’t end up in this scenario. Eg social recovery wallets. https://t.co/Fp6HghV5BU
31,@garrytan @0xElodin @eclipse_foods Debugging human biology is not as straightforward as debugging programs.
32,"@garrytan @0xElodin @eclipse_foods Please keep in mind when you see claims that vegetable oil is bad, it’s often based on mechanistic speculation (poor translation rate into actual human disease risk) and weak evidence tiers. Please be cautious when they claim (against cardiology consensus) that SF is protective."
33,@ClayStack_HQ 👀  sendemma.eth
34,@justingordon212 @rubenharris I’ve started running recently with a 11:30 long pace. How long did it take to get you to 7?
35,"@taimurabdaal Laser eyes in profile pic, ofc"
36,@sbuss I had assumed physical 2fa keys would be used for the enterprisey stuff.
37,"@tommycollison Day to day is very routine, but optimized to work on novel things. Also, adjusting your routine is a novelty itself."
38,"@whsource Yay! Glad to see this expanding :)
Is there a way to submit requests for books not on the existing list?"
39,@terronk For side projects: what let’s me write the least amount of code humanly possible
40,@terronk @cgallello New MacBooks are so fast your code skips builds and just goes straight to prod.
41,@Aging_Scientist @realNathanCheng Yup. I don’t know why we get so wound up over word semantics.
42,@hubermanlab Mostly 1 because of my priors around 2 (and mechanistic speculation in general). Eg only about 14% of clinical drug trials succeed. That being said it also depends on risk and potential benefit. Extremely low risk would make me open to trying something that only has a 14% chance.
43,@hjluks Most articles on polarized training seem to say Z1 for the low intensity rather than Z2. Do you disagree or is this a negligible thing?
44,@ContraPoints Seriously go to Amazon and type “programming socks” into the search bar.
45,"@ContraPoints They’re programming socks. They direct blood away from the legs and towards the brain, obviously."
46,"@shl NFT investing: 10,000% or -100% a year"
47,@nateliason What has convinced you that saturated fat is okay?
48,@mycoliza What’s your favorite plant you own?
49,@CharlesMBrenner I’m guessing then your*
50,@CharlesMBrenner I would guess the “aging is a disease” camp means “mechanisms that cause degeneration over time are a disease” and treating that is ultimately the same thing as when you say “improve aging”. I’m guessing when your “healthy aging” means “chronological aging minus degeneration”?
51,"@justingordon212 Anime profile pics count as a picture of myself, right :P"
52,@garrytan @sarthakgh Do you suggest any must follow Solana people on Twitter?
53,@BrantlyMillegan @garrytan @sarthakgh Do either of you have stats available on this? I’ve not heard much about this an am curious to learn more.
54,@DrAndyGalpin How many of these potential reasons can we confidently say are causal rather than just correlated?
55,@The_Nutrivore @Uqayyum123 @DaveKeto https://t.co/Ubi7yoL0nI
56,@The_Nutrivore @Uqayyum123 @DaveKeto It’s all about basing your diet and recommendations on something that has a &gt; 90% prior of being wrong (and dangerous if you’re wrong) and only then maybe later considering doing a study.
57,@ContraPoints Literally 1984
58,@Noahpinion I’m upset
59,@terronk But I can handle the business side. I’ll get some devs for $100.
60,"@NeerajKA “I _probably_ shouldn’t buy some randomly generated, fantasy-themed strings for $700” — Me, an idiot (circa 3 days ago)"
61,"@justingordon212 @rubenharris Many already said exercise so here is something a bit more niche:

Get a tutor for whatever you’re self studying. It would be nice for someone else to evaluate my self grading on exercises. Especially if answers aren’t provided with the exercises (math books, looking at you 🤬)."
62,@acemarke Haha I’m not even joking we just went through a meeting today where we looked at issues that are old so we can prioritize them. One of them was “Test [component name]” and it was from 12 months ago.
63,"@acemarke “Just add it to the backlog we’ll fix the tests in the next sprint”
- me, 13 sprints ago"
64,"@acemarke Meanwhile me:

Tests:       3 failed, 122 skipped, 1 passed, 126 total"
65,@ne0liberal Got eem
66,"@0xOlias @haydenzadams @lootproject @AxieInfinity Yup, that was it!"
67,"@econoar Broke: I sold my JPG for thousands
Woke: I sold my random text for thousands"
68,@haydenzadams @lootproject That reminds me how there is a game (forget its name) that required 3 NFT items to play so people started lending them since they were so expensive. The lenders got a cut of profits as the game reward currency was worth more than the salary of the people playing it.
