86,"While NFTs are seen as a way to fight centralization, we are far from it. The DMCA forcing Opensea to take it down is a big centralized move that should have killed any collection, as Opensea has a monopoly on the NFT market (for now). Phunks survived it and grew from it.

87,"The community created https://t.co/NlQoUUxDlX, a new marketplace for CryptoPhunks and it blew up in traction. Ironically, the attempts of @larvalabs at keeping them down made CryptoPhunks a symbol of taking the centralization fight to a whole other level.

89,"History: CryptoPhunks were delisted from @opensea 3 times and got a DMCA letter from @larvalabs several times. Devs didn't want to deal with the situation and ran off with the money and yet, the community didn't fall apart.

90,"At first they look like mirrored punks and that's not true at all, they also have a frame! But seriously, we should know by now that the NFT token itself is far more than its (centralized) image. So why do CryptoPhunks have a strong position in the NFT market? Here's why:
