Also shout @discoxyz for this. Disco means 'learn' in Latin 📖"
5,"@dayoadeosun10 idea - 1/1 nfts can be expensive. A 3 minute video has 4320 frames. Sell individual frames of a video that act as social tokens. Provide users access to exclusive videos, music or other utility. Then you can see who owns each frame like soundcloud comments. https://t.co/X0aWrcT43T"

13,ALT rarity structures for NFTs. Rarity starts at 0  and the  longer you hold your NFT the more it evolves and the more rare it becomes. Once sold it is burned into multiple NFTs with level 0 rarity
14,"Glad to have picked up one of these @3landersNFT. No roadmap or no utility (yet). Just a great community, talented artist/team and vibes. https://t.co/rNtGH3UU4O"
15,The landscape will change artistic practices for better and worst in many ways. It will nevertheless provide more ownership and control over creative work while providing new ways to incentive and monetize it.
16,Nfts allow for new methods of trustless royalty structures. Transparent and permanent records of transactions and supporters. The ability to reward holders of your work in creative ways that is not tied to a centralized platform like Spotify or YouTube.
17,"Investing in talented artists and their communities creates more overall value if you are a fan, investor, etc. Don’t like thinking about investors and music together? Most of your fav artists are completely backed by a label that limits their music ownership and creative control"
18,Artistic practices require capital. Buying physical or digital goods through web3 wallets leaves a digital footprint that the artist can always see forever. Providing the ability to reward fans in new ways.
19,"Supporting your first 10, 100, 1000 etc, fans allows supports to not only be recognized as part of the community but also be financially invested in growing the community. The artist grows, so does their NFT or social token."
20,Great artist will create incentives for their supports and encourage community growth. Growth not just for themselves as an artist but their supporters.
21,"A web3 wallet is not just a storage device. It is part of your identity, a immutable part of you existing online. Artists will always be able to see who their earliest supports by their wallet address and what they hold in a way that is not tied to a single website."
22,"Social tokens? “Social tokens are a type of currency that a brand, community, artists, etc can use to monetise their community beyond the traditional means”"
23,"Music, art and video NFT’s will not just act as collectibles. They will be seen as early iterations of social tokens. Artists will reward early supporters and create incentives for community growth through NFT and membership tokens🧵"

38,"@cory_eth I kinda feel the same way but at the same time it is a opportunity to reward creators for building brand awareness. I think this tactic should be used to incentivize community holders of existing project by airdropping holders who do fan art, gifs, etc."

41,@JohnCryptoRambo @iamDCinvestor @mdudas Ok fair enough. That makes sense but does the illiquid nature of nfts make that very difficult. I get it for tokens associated with nfts but don’t really understand it with 10k non fractionalized pfp’s.
42,@iamDCinvestor @mdudas I don’t really understand why we would want to short nfts? Would synthetics not increase volatility and disincentivize the community aspect of these projects? The natural direction seems to be more community and dao oriented. Why not leave shorting for tokens?
43,RT @cdixon: Nothing interesting is a waste of time.
44,@RyanSAdams Since when has it been cool to bash someone for trying. Learning will result in being wrong and failure. Supporting more things will result in failing more but also succeeding more. Increase your rate of failure for success

48,@oncyber_xyz Do more with less tho
49,@DeezeFi nft dips aren’t as scary or volatile as tokens though. Think it’s because people aren’t using leverage when buying nft. Some people may be losing money selling at a loss because loans or bills but people swoop in quickly. Most people are ok waiting out the dip
