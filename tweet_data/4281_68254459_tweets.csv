4,@brian_armstrong Hey @brian_armstrong please add GUSD support or update us on the Unsupported ERC-20 Recovery plans. At least a handful of us have large amounts of GUSD stuck in our USDC wallet. Using linked CB Wallets to transfer those ERC-20 coins should be a workable solution.
5,"@ZeroHedge_ honestly a melt up to that area or even *gulp* new ATHs would make so much sense. if BTC goes 6 figures before the next halving.. doing it now would make way more sense than it would have last fall when it was consensus.

11,The journey will be ever-changing as the possibilities of Web3 continue to expand exponentially but one thing is clear… Legacy brands should begin their adventure and be humble in their approach as old playbooks are burned. 7/7
12,"With the coming maturation of Web3 technologies, and experiences those who do will be positioned to welcome mainstream consumers who would (in success) continue to affix their loyalty to them over a native Web3 upstart with similar product. 6/7"
13,"As with any major technological shift, we'll likely be starting with consumers who are Web3 aficionados and early evangelists as brands shape their role in the metaverse. 5/7"
14,Brands have the opportunity to begin building the scaffolding for a Minimum Viable Community. Developing a roadmap to grow that into a thriving Web3 community of brand evangelists. 4/7
15,"Within that shift, brand loyalty is likely to accrue to those who provide the best Return on Time (as a measure of factors both tangible and intangible such as sense of belonging). 3/7"
16,"As mainstream adoption unfolds over the decade, a gradual understanding of the social and economic power afforded by these incentive structures will occur. 2/7"
17,"Web3 is the great pivot toward a Community economy. A place where new mechanisms to interact, learn and earn will radically change how and why consumers support brands. 1/7"
18,2/2 The burden on anyone building a Minimum Viable Community will be to establish and track “Return on Time” as KPI. A measurement of both value provided and appreciation potential of community owned assets in correlation to their initial cost. @alexisohanian @balajis @cdixon
19,"1/2 Thinking about scarcity of time and how the future of community as enabled by Web3 will lower the # of tribes any individual will be able to actively participate in.

How will they assess? 

One factor amongst many may be which provides a higher “Return on Time”."

Hard to believe they would make us wait indefinitely for them to support GUSD when they are technically able to send those funds and we can see them in our wallet"

62,"(6/6) Monetizing is first because in the Own/Earn world your community participation = your job. Ideally it’s aligned with passions.

Web2 - monetization = transaction 
Web3 - monetization = investment

63,(5/6) If you see something you love in the above — you jump in and “monetize” the community by choosing to seed invest with your time and light capital.

87,(13/13) and ultimately everyone will Earn together. This is the true unlock and promise of Web3. We’re now in a read/write/own world. Your consumers now choose to work for you and the upside is available to all. 🚀
88,(12/13) The best brand builders post Web3 are going to be expert storytellers at crafting the Spark that drives people to come together... and then relentlessly add CommValue and IP Value -- which will naturally incentivize engagement and loyalty…
89,(11/13) As a brand builder you’re organizing and monetizing via the Spark and then engagement comes as a by-product of your decentralized work force following incentives to consume &amp; promote. Right click delete on Web2 era commercialization.
90,"(10/13) Let’s use @cdixon ’s mental model:

Web2 = engagement first, monetization second
Web3 = monetization first, engagement second"
91,"(9/13) As the product itself is scarce and likely to dwarf supply, it adds additional CommValue as others see the long tail appreciation of assets they could have been gifted as members of the Community. The idea of future scarce products will not escape consideration."
92,"(8/13) This one:two punch realizes the community as an engagement army following an incentive structure to purchase, gift, and generally promote the product to themselves raise IP and CommValue."
93,"(7/13) In a characteristically savvy move, @garyvee also added CommValue by gifting bottles of the premium wine to IP hodlers, setting the tone for continued perks and signaling that it’s lucrative to be within the VeeFriends walls."
94,"(6/13) Gary added IP value by putting that character into the world, raising awareness of both it and umbrella brand, and establishing traits through association that will follow it to other mediums in time (ex: animation)."
95,(5/13) IP Value is a secondary concern and currently focused on adding to desirability of the organizational assets (NFTs) that represent fractionalized ownership within the collective. Ex: @garyvee dropping empathy elephant wine.
96,(4/13) Continual accrual of Community Value not only rewards hodlers of associated IP and hardens loyalty but dials up external fervor as outsiders promote collective IP as a proxy for membership. This further dials up CommValue.
97,(3/13) Community value is seen through external desirability of the collective. Ex: Is it cool to be in the Bored Ape Yacht Club? Cost of entry rises accordingly to market assessment of that question. This will have second order impact on IP desirability as well.
98,(2/13) With a spark — your job is to bring relentless focus to adding Community Value and IP Value. Two distinct concerns.
99,(1/13) It all starts with a spark. An idea that serves as a beacon to corral disparate individuals across the globe. Without a core thematic — the initial signal may not be strong enough to break through and attract a community. A Minimum Viable Community is key to idea validity.
