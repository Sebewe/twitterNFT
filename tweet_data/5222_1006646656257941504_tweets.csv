58,@jul1keller Thank you Ser 🤝
59,"6/ So if you want to make it in the long run - focus on learning, start buidling, and go talk to people and help them if you can. WAGMI 💪"
60,"5/ After following top courses like CryptoZombies and @_buildspace, it’s time to buidl on my own (and yes mom, I'll finish my studies). What a blessed time to be alive, so much ressources and support around here!! 🤓"
61,Btw I'm really proud of what we achieved so far frens @ComeProst @muskgetmask @BeigbederPhoebe @don_cryptow3 @nicolasvrillac @diazmath_ ☄️
62,"4/ With some of my frens, we decided to create @nft_paris, a non-profit event which will take place at @joinstationf on January 22nd. There will be amazing people like @bneiluj , @jdetychey, @johnkarp and top companies like @TheSandboxGame, @Ledger or @animocabrands 🔥"
63,3/ Fine. Meeting new people is a good way to learn new stuff and discover really game-changing ideas. But how to leverage all that encounters? Let’s gather all that crazy Web3 people in an event in my hometown! 🇫🇷
64,"2/ Then I started being more interested by the NFT and Blockchain technologies/usages than by quick money - I left most of the PFP discords and joined @developer_dao 👩‍💻 One of my best decisions! No more FOMO, only great buidlers, always happy and available to help like @dabit3 🧱"
65,"1/ When I saw all that money people were making on PFP projects, I activated degen mode: I couldn’t make more mistakes and lose as much time and money as at that time #pawzees 🐾
I was like “nah, Bored Apes are ok, but what about that [insert shitty project] thing” 😅"
