77,"Another example of a solid project : 
@TheVisitorsNFT. Instant reveal with no randomized distribution, which preserves the order of minting if you care about having a lowered numbered Visitor."
78,"Again, look at what they did with the explorer. It's a much better way to find an avatar that fits, or just to explore what's available. Cherry on top is that it's implementing with their smart contract on the backend."

@ExpansionPunks.  @florianuhde
