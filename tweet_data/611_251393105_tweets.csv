28,@alxocity I see at least 5.5 trade tickets in there…(amazing pack!)
29,@Stoniphantom I think you are going to continue being successful making that change. Just want you to know that.
30,@topshotfund I like the queue system a lot - just wish you could authorize payment ahead of time and if you got selected they took funds and just dropped the pack. It can make for a long day just staring at the screen…but still better than gas wars and WL theatrics

75,@TheeHustleHouse @BoredApeYC I sold my serum (a tad early!) - it was nice to have some liquidity and take a little off the table - made me feel comfortable about holding everything else - realizing some profits from time to time is not a bad thing. And 20+ Eth is real money …my $0.02
76,I’m afraid to even list my ape at an aspirational price… if not paying attention could get floor swept in short order. Delist or get delisted.
