13,@RareEditionCo I know y'all got the most insane collection of everything! Looking forward to your launch. ;)
14,"@jagg753 @Jon_HQ @opensea But I tried contacting @opensea about it months ago. And I still haven't received a response from them. 

If you happen to see this, OpenSea, I'd be happy to send you the TX; showing exactly how I was rugged on your site. It isn't a BAYC; but it's still a glitch on your platform."
15,@jagg753 @Jon_HQ @opensea It was a strange contract interaction. An account bought an NFT from one of my wallets and immediately sold it to another wallet of mine for a 0.3 ETH profit. All I did was add WETH to the wallet that purchased the NFT. I didn't prompt anything else. Thats the gist of it at least
16,@MrRobbieCatMan Silver fox....? Whoa now! It's just a gray patch. It ain't my entire skull....yet. Haha.
17,"New #PFP in celebration of #GetNukedWeek.

My @StonedApeCrew rescued some pretty nuclear apes. https://t.co/7X5UqnhyxA"
18,@Jon_HQ I was rugged by @opensea about 6 months ago and I’m still waiting for them to reply to my ticket. Best of luck to everyone who got their property stolen. I hope you receive better and fair compensation from #OpenSea - and not to be compared to my situation with them.
19,@Monstrecrypto @Snappaz @the_x2y2 I ain't mad at it. Even with it down 25%. Free is free. Haha.
20,@Monstrecrypto @Snappaz @the_x2y2 I'm still holding my $LOOKS. But I bought more $X2Y2 on top of what I was able to claim from some of my wallets (I just wasn't able to claim from all of them before the pause). You should check your NFT rewards on the site. You earn tokens every day for listing your NFTs as well.
21,@BitcoinSVworld @Monstrecrypto @Snappaz @the_x2y2 I was able to claim on some of my wallets. But I still have a few more that haven't been able to claim. So I just bought some more tokens &amp; staked everything. You should check your NFT staking rewards as well. You earn tokens every day for listing your NFTs on the site.
22,"@Monstrecrypto @Snappaz @the_x2y2 My mistake. But since this is on a thread from a tweet that I started; would everyone mind keeping things civil? We're all in this together guys. Everyone is entitled to their opinions. But let's not throw stones at one another, just because you don't agree. WAGMI. Much love."
23,@NSJCSolanaNFTs @StonedApeCrew I would definitely put @StonedApeCrew up there as one of my favorite projects. 100%
24,"@NSJCSolanaNFTs @StonedApeCrew I know what you mean. I'm in a few house-level projects. But SAC has definitely rivaled some ETH projects I've been in as well. Yeah, they aren't selling for $50-100k yet. But PUFF on 7 SACs is around $3k a month. Just for holding. So, I love SAC. The passive income is great..."
25,"@NSJCSolanaNFTs @StonedApeCrew Truth. I've been in some amazing projects on ETH. But the gas fees are killer. And I've also been in a few rugs - on both SOL and ETH. Those always suck. But it comes with the territory I suppose. You just have to count your blessings when they come. SAC is one of those, for me."
26,"@Monstrecrypto @Snappaz @the_x2y2 I just checked, and...

Eyes - dry.
Face - dry.
Lips - not quivering. 

It seems I haven't been crying about it."
27,"@Snappaz @the_x2y2 So far, the token has only been gaining in value. I'm sure it'll take a hit, once they reopen the airdrop. But that's just crypto. I doubt it's as nefarious as the aforementioned list, my brotha. That seems a bit conspiratorial. And too much effort for not a whole lot in gains."
28,"@Mixbrick @the_x2y2 @LooksRareNFT If you need to find your private keys; just use https://t.co/V3heeWtd81, type in your mnemonic phrase, and switch the settings to ""ETH"". Then find your main address - next to that will be your private keys. 

MAKE SURE TO DISCONNECT FROM THE INTERNET BEFORE PUTTING YOUR INFO IN."
29,"@Snappaz @the_x2y2 I don't think they have insiders. If you read their post, that's kinda what they talked about. A majority of the tokens go to the airdrop and staking. That's what I read at least. 🤷‍♂️"
30,"@cumcollector_e @the_x2y2 I'm also a ""verified"" human being [insert hand jerk]. I'm not afraid to call shit out, if it isn't working. But... I appreciate that they gave me a response. Most of the time folks just ignore posts like that. So... Respect to #X2Y2. ✊"
31,@the_x2y2 Thanks for the reply. I'll hold my horses. Just hoping to claim my tokens so I can begin staking. I appreciate the response though. Best of luck on the new marketplace.
32,"@Mixbrick @the_x2y2 @LooksRareNFT Oooooh, shit. That sucks. I didn't know about that one. They ought to add their private keys into MM, so they can sign without their device. I dunno... That's what I did. And I own a Ledger."
33,@Koalemos_NFT @StonedApeCrew Thanks fam. Been around for a bit. But I always love the SAC folks. You all are a great group of people. Much love. ✊
34,@NSJCSolanaNFTs @StonedApeCrew And I bought my SACs when they were 4 SOL on @MagicEden_NFT . I didn't wait until they were at 60. I'm no baller. I just got lucky.
35,"@NSJCSolanaNFTs @StonedApeCrew There are ""ETH people""...? 

Look, my brotha... I don't discriminate with #NFTs. I love them all. I got very lucky with @StonedApeCrew. Currently, all 7 of my apes are on a mission to get nuked! Or they're being rented out for others to get nuked. That's what's up. #GetNukedWeek"
36,"Yo, @the_x2y2 -- What's the deal with your #airdrop being paused? You're coming up on 24 hours now. I think it's about time to roll. Especially if someone has approved all of the NFTs needed to claim their tokens. Come on now. This ""fairdrop"" is looking a bit unfair."

84,"@BrandonLipton Nahhh... It's my @0xApes_NFT. I suppose I could buy a BAYC if I wanted to. But I would feel dumb spending that much money on an NFT - especially since I was broke not too long ago.
