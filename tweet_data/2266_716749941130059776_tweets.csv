It 's been an interesting conversation. Security should be a concern for every blockchain user since we are the owners of our money 👏"
22,@smwise55 @Deadfellaz Toads are fire...
23,"@BoogieGM @FPLAdmiral @exitliquidity1 @argentHQ That said, obviously I'm not an expert in security, but these are the good practices I've learned from the community, maybe someone can bring more light to this topic!"
24,"@BoogieGM @FPLAdmiral @exitliquidity1 @argentHQ And the case you expose, yes, the assets will be fine since your new wallet doesn't have any signature, and we are assuming that your seedphrase is not compromised!"
25,"@BoogieGM @FPLAdmiral @exitliquidity1 @argentHQ What is safe for you? OS couldn't be safe for whatever reason, ie. the new contract they released could be exploited (I don't mean it's/ll be exploited). If anything is stolen, you always can revoke signatures first, but in my case i would transfer my tokens."
26,"@BoogieGM @FPLAdmiral @exitliquidity1 @argentHQ This is why a hw wallet per se is not a vault. A vault shouldn't interact with any contract, and move your assets to secured wallets (riskier than vault, but safer than hot wallets) if you want to sell. You'll spend more eth moving them, but safer."
27,"@BoogieGM @FPLAdmiral @exitliquidity1 Then you can store your assets on hardware wallets or other kind of wallet, like @argentHQ where you can set up guardians, and apparently is safer than storing seedphrases.. if your hw interacted with a malicious contract, or it's compromised, they can drain your wallet anyway."
28,"@BoogieGM @FPLAdmiral @exitliquidity1 You can use the method you prefer. For sure you shouldn't interact with contracts with your main wallet, the one where you have your expensive nfts. I prefer to risk assets on my hot wallets because is faster for minting or trade."
29,The truth 🤣 https://t.co/fQKLftqRt6
30,@exitliquidity1 @FPLAdmiral https://t.co/R2vCd091EH
31,"Btw, when is @opensea going to, I don't know, send a tweet or something 🧐"
32,"The best scenario, apparently the NFTs stolen is related to a phishing attack emulating Opensea emails (what a surprise...). Have you received any email from @LooksRareNFT 👀? the wort, really OS messed up the migration contract? Damn... stay safe frens."
33,"@FPLAdmiral @exitliquidity1 Then is not a vault, is just a hardware wallet. Hot wallet (mint/trading) -&gt; hardware wallet (selling) -&gt; vault wallet (is a hardware wallet too) only to storage expensive nfts. Vault doesn't interact even with Opensea. If you want to sell a BAYC transfer to hw wallet from vault."
34,"@FPLAdmiral @exitliquidity1 What he is saying, a vault should not interact with any contract, even opensea. Vault != Hardware wallet."
