Also what you say isn’t false but you also have a terrible sample size - it was like 3 degrees when you came. Different story in the summer."
19,@LowOwnedWR @WinkyChrist How do you know this aren’t you still a teenager
20,@WinkyChrist When was the last time a bar played “Party All the Time”? Marley’s music is still hella relevant in culture and played at places where I may go

55,@FantasyGuruDrew That would be more accurate
56,@FantasyGuruDrew No it's cool misquoting the price of an asset by 3.8 million to deceive followers into thinking negatively about an asset is a totally legit thing to do
57,@FantasyGuruDrew I mean you quote tweeted agreeing with a false tweet with no other context unsure how anyone is supposed to have that as the takeaway
58,@FantasyGuruDrew Not to rain on your latest haterade parade tweet but there’s no way that ape is worth 1280 ETH so this is a false comparison. About a $300K house is correct and that’s probably even a little high after transaction fees turning ETH into cash
