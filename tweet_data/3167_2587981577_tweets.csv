2,@JoeBiden There’s no point of bashing him for this. If you think he’s looking at twitter or even knows how to get on the app you are wildly mistaken
3,@JoeBiden Your an absolute clown for this. Give @Tesla and @elonmusk the recognition they deserve. Ridiculous.

18,@Drizz1978 @TheHumanoidsNFT @Pixelmon I know it just sucks seeing that shit go for 3* ETH when this is quite honestly the best quality project art wise in the space. It’s under appreciated
19,"@beamingzz @InvsbleFriends I agree but it’s just like you see a pattern with these projects. I want to see it so well but the way it’s turning out is extremely similar and I don’t think it’s good for the NFT space. Absolutely no mint should be over .08 rn. Idc 3D, 4K. Big no no for me"
20,"@royalfisticuffs @beamingzz @InvsbleFriends Not tru. I just don’t believe in expensive mints, botted hype, immediate high floor price out the bay…. Its not sustainable. People only care about flipping now. reason why some of these projects like BAYC made it is bc it took a long while to build and community stayed strong"
21,"@beamingzz @InvsbleFriends Not saying you are. I’m saying this project won’t make it. Was at 13 Eth down to 5.7 now. Meka, HAPE, IF. A cycle of people getting pumped and dumped"
22,@TheHumanoidsNFT Where else r y finding this quality
23,"IM SO EXCITE @TheHumanoidsNFT
 
Please just look at this detail. But Y’all would rather buy a @Pixelmon for 3 Eth😭😭😭 https://t.co/XCqx1GsMwS"

33,@itstylersays Yes tell her how you really feel
34,@rotiboy1002 @BoredApeYC @BoredMeka I think they look dope I just don’t really involve myself in those 3D derivitive stuff. Usually plays out negatively !
35,@rotiboy1002 @BoredApeYC @BoredMeka No sir I don’t think I will. Just another cash grab
36,@CanalFarr @BoredApeYC @0xMAYC_NFT No no this is exactly what I was trying to avoid sir😂
37,@papacheung @BoredApeYC Yooo yours is 🔥
38,@LooksRareNFT We appreciate you. Keep at it. One day people will see how much of a better platform you are than that other 🗑
39,@Cryptofur_ @BoredApeYC Followed back 🤝
40,@1dalehardiman I doubt he bought this. Highly highly doubt.
41,@1dalehardiman I own a mayc so I’m not  complaining but the first month I lost out on big gains which turned into losses and getting carried away thinking the floor would never fall … which it did 😂

49,Nobody cares why you sold your NFT
50,@xabinft @WeatheReportNFT How’s the team on this one? I been looking at it
51,@itstylersays I mean if u spent 3 Eth to mint this you need to reevaluate
52,"@cr0ssETH Or, don’t spent fukin 3 Eth to mint something. This is the community at fault.. we should know better."

54,@BillAckman @johnnie6111 Ukraine will hold strong imo. Especially with the aid of other countries giving them weapons and supplies. Ukraine has something to fight for and that’s not losing their home. Russia has nothing to fight for and I bet 50%+ of their troops know it’s wrong
55,"@cobie @johnnie6111 I mean really tho, what did u expect with a 3 Eth mint? The higher the mint price the higher chance of u being disappointed"
