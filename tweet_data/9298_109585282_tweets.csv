- Drop some eth on all of this 🤷‍♂️"

Great time to ask yourself:

So... https://t.co/ksoSOltOvZ"
57,"Despite things that still suck, I have high hopes for the DAO space!

58,"More like mosaics of interoperable building blocks than monolithic platforms of the past.

These super-platforms should actually be possible to build, for the first time ever 😅

- And we’re building one of them🙃
https://t.co/UiBZwT8F1T

Anyway, let's start wrapping this up!"
59,"Most likely there won’t be “a chat platform”, “a social media platform”, “a freelancing platform”, or “an educational platform” - instead, different interoperable building blocks will be assembled into platforms that are *just right* for this or that specific community.
... https://t.co/rctuCgm4m2"
60,"...Imagine how much more value could be unlocked if all of this was interoperable 🤯

Discord &amp; twitter just won’t do.

To enable the flow of information, people &amp; resources between communities and allow everyone to be more effective, I think we’ll need *proper* platforms."
61,"Imagine how much value could be unlocked inside of your DAO if instead of having 150 channels, there were proper interfaces for:
- Getting a better view of what's going on
- What needs to happen next
- Who are the people
- What are their skills &amp; time availability
- etc etc etc https://t.co/VABr4qfi8q"
62,"If you want to see the ones I listed, you're gonna have to go read the thing🙃

- We also need to start assembling these building blocks.. https://t.co/xvNjzLsuUJ"
63,"Many individual pieces need to exist before we can put them together into functional decentralized societies.

64,"Came up with your meme yet?

If not, know there are plenty of great existing missions out there doing anything related to Ethereum &amp; DAOs 🙃

Overall, there seems to be this belief that Ethereum is core infrastructure for societies of the future, but how do we get there?"
65,"So let's build meme driven organizations.
- Some higher purpose, but make it not just a facade 🙃
- Maybe write or adopt something like the MetaManifesto 🤷‍♂️
https://t.co/AyGXMiq3lg https://t.co/mOWfHt2RWu"
66,"Token voting will almost inevitably result in the same kind of dynamics🙈

More important than ever to put the meme at the center of what we doing &amp; make sure incentives are properly aligned.
- Coupled tightly with a ""triple bottom line"" sort of thinking.

67,"The problem with trad corps is that they become completely driven by profit, optimized to extract.

They might have “a mission” but it becomes skewed by their fiduciary duty towards shareholders 😬

68,"Not working on anything yet? Maybe take one of these visions &amp; run with it! 🤷‍♂️

69,"How it will go down:
- Interested will join https://t.co/joHXiO9rzO

71,"Consider this a challenge to dream &amp; write a short story about:

- That solarpunk future, where Moloch manifestations are effectively dealt with
- “World after Ethereum”

Let's stop with all the dystopian sci-fi bullshit &amp; think of a future we *want* to live in 🙏 https://t.co/vD1e5K1iNE"
72,"So, how do we fight Moloch &amp; create the solarpunk future?

I'm thinking:
- Come up with more visions of better futures
- Make it easier to create building blocks
- Start assembling building blocks into platforms
- Pick our fights &amp; support causes outside of our bubbles

... https://t.co/zEBL08OwQ2"
73,"Let’s not be like Silicon Valley bros saying we’re ""making an impact” by building a new app for the privileged while their streets are full of shit &amp; homeless people. Every project should have a % of their tokens go to public goods 🤷‍♂️"
74,"Are we really changing anything if capital remains what has the final say as well as the main goal?

Decentralized coordination is great but again, what are we coordinating towards?"
75,"We should be careful we’re not replicating patterns of the old world.

So far, wealth inequality is worse than in the real world &amp; most DAOs are turning out to be plutocracies.

Some are even starting to ask “should DAO workers have a fiduciary duty towards token holders?” 😅"
76,"Where is the DAO space going *then*?
Guess the next step is networks of interlocking DAOs, dStates or however we name them.

Means we’re changing the world for the better?
Not necessarily.

Making coordination easier doesn't solve the “what are we coordinating towards” problem.."
77,"In short, it's hard for DAO:
- Summoners to find everything they need to start a DAO
- Operators to see what’s going on &amp; find things they need to succeed
- Contributors to stay connected &amp; in the loop with more than a handful of DAOs
But it will get better 🙃"
78,"The truth is, we’re still super early 🤷‍♂️

If you ever tried building a DAO, you know the DAO framework itself is far from the only thing needed.

Everything else you need is a jumble of different web3 &amp; web2 tools, platforms, knowledge sources &amp; communities🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/wu6DBM86Pj"
79,"We do have some pretty cool tools &amp; incentive systems for better coordination. From basics like rewarding, staking &amp; slashing to DAO frameworks that keep growing in terms of their feature sets as well as the tooling around them 👀

80,"For Defeating Moloch
One of my favorites, thank you @ameensol 

It’s about Moloch as the God of Coordination Failure &amp; the ultimate cause of our inability to solve problems that plague societies.

Sounds great, so what makes us think we can kill the bastard?
Well..."
81,"Ethereum is Solarpunk

Solarpunk is an art movement imagining a better future &amp; Ethereum is a technology for building the future.

82,"ReFi - degen to regen

Love this meme because it kind of takes degening - an act of chasing profit in a high risk, high reward manner - and turns it into something positive. Instead of trying to change human nature, it's about channelling it to public goods. https://t.co/ZNY7BjG3vl"
83,"Farming shitcoins &amp; buying jpegs?
Props to exceptions but the vast majority of projects seem to be copies in hopes of quick profit; served to those mindlessly aping in eternal search for more gains.

A lot of degening &amp; not enough regening 😬
Which brings us to... https://t.co/huzLBUJXzv"
84,"Ultra-sound money

Think the fact it was about more than “better money” is what got most of us interested in Ethereum over Bitcoin?

Disregarding potential negative side effects of deflationary money, let’s ask ourselves:

Ultra-sound money for what?"
85,"So let’s get started with memes!

World Computer - Great but unfortunately not very true. If you tried using it to compute something, you must be incredibly wealthy &amp; have a lot of time on your hands 😅

Still, lets not dismiss it! Great thinking behind it https://t.co/5dqszaxtPt"
86,"Goes on about:
- Some of dominant memes
- Decentralized coordination; obstacles, pitfalls &amp; solutions
- Building towards a decentralized future - but what kind?
- Inspiring people to think beyond personal financial freedom
- Building blocks &amp; lego societies
- Simple ways to help"
87,"TL;DR

We build &amp; build but we forget to ask ourselves why.

Meanwhile, every cycle dilutes idealism &amp; profit becomes more of a driving force.

How do we get ppl to pick the path of value creation over path of profit extraction if we’re not at least offering compelling visions?🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/P4igk4qTsX https://t.co/sxDKR7yjlP"
