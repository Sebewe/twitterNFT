Cheers."
85,"18/ I love to see the progress and adoption that the #crypto #web3 #NFT space is gaining but we really need to improve the discourse and cut out the psyops (looking mostly at you bitcoiners).
It's not a zero-sum game and it's not a #web2 vs #web3 battle unless we force it to be."
86,"17/ For anyone who's already familiar with tech/programing, @hashoshi4 is a great resource. He does some fantastic educational content for users of all levels of sophistication, but he also has a lot of stuff that gets really into the technical weeds. https://t.co/dZjP8t4gN9"
87,"16/ @coinbureau is the best broad #cryptoeducation outfit in the game. Their YouTube videos formed the early foundations of my #crypto #web3 #NFT knowledge and I still watch their stuff regularly today. Also recommend signing up for their weekly newsletter
https://t.co/hNYG5Oujto"
88,"15/ If you do find someone legitimately interested in learning more, there's a couple places I would send them.
@cdixon is a gifted communicator and advocate for #web3 - https://t.co/0hR8kCWlTN ""Why web3 matters"" in particular is a great piece. https://t.co/iXQIa0TmHa"
89,"14/ Ask yourself: ""Is my time better spent arguing right now or is it better spent building?"""
90,"13/ The quantity and quality of these examples are only going to increase with time. 
So before engaging a skeptic, you should ask two questions.
Ask them: ""What would change your mind?""
If they say ""nothing"", move on."
91,"12/ It's still early days but we're no longer arguing on purely future potential, to the contrary, there's increasingly more and more very real and compelling active real-world uses that you can point people to. Seeing is believing and will get you much farther than words alone."
92,"11/ Unnecessary:
While the #crypto #web3 #NFT space is still pretty nascent in the grand scheme of things, we're still well out of the vaporware phase that were the first 10 years or so of crypto and have entered the real-world use case era."
93,10/ We need to have dialogue and we need to avoid active conflict. This is all so radically new that we mustn't forget that the onus is squarely on us to explain.
94,"9/ These parties will critique, dismiss, and attack the #web3 native. While it is difficult what feels like a natural response, psyops and counterattacking are not the answers. Telling people ""Have fun being poor"" is going to make them double down on their beliefs. https://t.co/6jWymYpG8O"
95,"8/ Additionally, there are legacy big money interests that have already or will soon be heavily disrupted by #crypto #web3 #NFTs. They are going to actively oppose and drum up opposition amongst their base (game studios/gamers are a key example here)."
96,"7/ By nature of the nascency, much of the ecosystem is clunky and convoluted even if you're deep into the space. 
At face value, some of this stuff, especially #NFTs, can sound preposterous to the uninitiated and tbh there are elements at the current stage that are preposterous."
97,"6/ Counterproductive: 
#crypto #web3 #NFTs are radically new and radically different from existing conventions. 
It is difficult for people to wrap their heads around concepts that don't have great existing reference points."
98,"5/ So that being said, let me tell you that IMO psy ops are 
A. Counterproductive
B. Unnecessary"
99,"4/ I've been a lifelong debater, which my parents will confirm between heavy exasperated sighs. 
tldr: persuasion is my business."
