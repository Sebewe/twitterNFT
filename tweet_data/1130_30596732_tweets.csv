7,The Price of Everything https://t.co/Up5Af5k9Uo - and to round out tonight’s education an all time classic. This is a must watch if you want to understand the art biz.
8,What makes art valuable   BBC Documentary HD https://t.co/C8wYdQep4s via @YouTube  - here is another one. Enjoy.
9,The Black Box of the Art Business https://t.co/TDEScMDvGA via @YouTube  - here is a documentary that shows how the wealthy avoid taxes using the Geneva Freeport. May open your mind. https://t.co/oIwLQzDXLb
10,@LowlyLyricist Yup
11,@cclccl4461 Seems legit 🤷🏻‍♂️
12,@Fwiz good stuff
13,I feel like anyone buying #NFT projects claiming gaming utility should listen to this podcast. ⁦@BanklessHQ⁩ ⁦@banklessnyc⁩  https://t.co/je8jBXSDah
14,RT @SpeculatorArt: Isn't it kind of funny and ironic that Vitalik allegedly created Ethereum after frustration from World of Warcraft nerfi…

16,@_benxit_ Right that would be sweet 😂 https://t.co/07ff5nQHJf
17,"RT @SpeculatorArt: Dang -50% on a currency in one day.

That's worse than most altcoins can do in a day."

20,@JonesSticky I’m with ya !
21,@LowlyLyricist @CryptoMories What exactly happened ?
22,@nft_nate_ Would @garyvee be that .1%
23,@Topsydo22 First world problems 😂
24,@satsgains @Pixelmon If you want to take a flier it may not be a bad idea. A lot of people have a big incentive to hold or they will lose their ass. We have seen stranger things
25,@SpeculatorArt That’s a decent size payroll for any company. A good incentive to keep grinding.
26,@nft_nate_ Depends on the celeb
27,@LowlyLyricist Hope he has insurance
28,@DieHardMMAPod Wow. That’s crazy. That line would get much closer if it happened
29,@AngieOverkill Eat some of the best food in the world! Love #NYC!

38,RT @pablostanley: I’m so so grateful for the @robotosNFT community and team. You’re all fantastic. Thank you. ❤️
39,@BlancuzNFT @Pixelmon @RumbleKongs @grayboysdao Couldn’t sense my humor?
40,@vingoslang Whatever is quiet and has been around for more than 6 months :)
41,"@BeerAndNFT @RumbleKongs The dust will settle, and the cream will eventually rise to the top. NFT market  is less than 2 years old. Really, things didn’t pick up till 2021. Everything can’t go up forever and it is already getting diluted. When it hits it’s gonna hit hard. Have you stacks ready."
42,@economist @AB84 Ha ha ha…  I’m not sure taking NFT/Financial advice from @AB84 is a smart move I much prefer @LILUZIVERT for my #NFT picks. https://t.co/ePBRn1rAE0

57,@SEECRITS Looks like it’s getting serious
58,This @kanyewest doc on @netflix is 🔥! The @iamjamiefoxx part on episode 2 is funny. I can’t believe they recorded all of this.
59,@beijingdou @ParallelNFT Ha ha I got airdropped a 1/3 art card then immediately swept the floor after selling for 6 ETH…. Then…. Everything went backwards lol
