42,"Something we all have in common is passion for sneakers and for streetwear and fashion and culture. We wanna deliver something quality to folks, so we’ll be providing digital and physical experiences to our community as well as giving back portions to different orgs worldwide."
43,I’m the audio element of the crew. Having been doing music NFTs for the last year I’ve been fully immersed in web3 and have just been thinking about how I can continue to add culture to it.
44,Joey is the co-founder of @MLLN_io and puts together the sneaker element of this project. Super lowkey but if you head over to his social media you can see he’s super forward thinking when it comes to sneaker design and has a sold out NFT sneaker collection on Opensea
45,"David works over at Vibram as the design creative director, but this isn’t a Vibram project. He’s our visual artist guy, a fantastic painter, and a fantastic dude — adding a visual element and hustle to this project."
46,"The team is actually super fire, the other two guys I’m working with on this, @Davidfilar &amp; @Joey_Khamis are bonafide sneaker folks, so much so they BOTH got written about in @highsnobiety recently.
(Let’s do a space @jeffcarvalho)

83,"As always, thanks for joining me on this journey. I’m pinning this thread for the moment. If you have any questions, whether or not you threw in…ask away.

✌️"
84,"I have lots of goals, but in web3, one of my biggest goals is to push the envelope as much as possible and inspire artists and collectors to join me in that push. Artists are creating DAOs. Labels are showing up as DAOs. This is my spin on that."
85,"If you’re an artist interested in this sort of thing, the tools I specifically used are:
1. Catalog aka @catalogworks (it’s a closed platform but you can openly use @ourZORA NFTs on ⬇️)
2. PartyBid aka @prtyDAO 
3. Mirror aka @viamirror 
4. Snapshot aka @SnapshotLabs"
86,"If you contributed to my partybid back then and haven’t claimed your $SHRP tokens, you’re out of luck until next week’s votes BUT hit me up so I can get you set.

If you have your $SHRP tokens, head to the snapshot page and vote: https://t.co/TTktJ7qGqD"
87,"I have some really cool collectors of $SHRP (the token) on that front, who I won’t be asking to do anything special, I’m not gonna dox y’all or anything, but it’s an exciting thought nonetheless."
88,"I think if artists end up having really interesting collectors who either have skills or connections to folks who can support them, then there’s a chance those folks may pull some strings to help you out, as there’s an interest in making the NFT bigger."
89,Pop open this pic to look at proposal 2 about how much I should pay myself out of the 3 ETH I made from selling the NFT: https://t.co/9VJSNAvUE9
90,Pop open this pic to look at proposal 1 about whether or not I should put Sharp on streaming services: https://t.co/6cdANv76kg
91,"With the proposals (the things I allow folks to vote on (I’m pretty sure proposal is jargon in this space)), I’m able to maintain certain decision making power to myself and give other power my community through letting them decide. I write the pros and cons of each decision"
92,"Here’s a link to the Snapshot page if you guys wanna read more and follow along. You’ll be able to see which wallet addresses vote for which thing, with every individual having the same voting power, despite the amount they invested: 

https://t.co/TTktJ7qGqD"
93,"Using a platform called Snapshot (@SnapshotLabs), people who participated in the PartyBid (by @prtyDAO) are using the token they received as proof of fractional ownership to vote on 2 things today:
1. Should the song go on streaming
2. Do I pay myself 0.5 ETH or 1 ETH"
94,"Something a lot of folks, artists especially, talk about when it comes to music NFTs is allowing their collectors to be a part of their careers, and while I think they’re talking about financially…I wanted to take it a little deeper and let them make decisions with me."
95,"Back in November, I minted an NFT for a song called Sharp on Catalog (@catalogworks) and in my initial thread about the NFT I allude to trying something new and having the community involved in it. https://t.co/37OA0shKpr"
96,"Hi! I sold a music NFT for 3 ETH at the beginning of the year on @catalogworks using @prtyDAO’s PartyBid &amp; in an effort to allow my collectors to be involved with my career, I’m allowing everyone involved to vote on future decisions for the song.

Let’s talk about it (🧵)"
