Always align your tokenomics with product deliverables.

When the APR runs out, will your product be enough to stand on its own? #azftokentips🪙"
20,"Really great 🧵 by @swombat on being thoughtful when buying into projects.

I’ve followed some of the same principles over time.

Saying no to the 1% projects that moon also means saying no to the 99% of projects that don’t. 

It’s ok to feel fomo, but know it’s a good strat. https://t.co/pt9dCo1KV2"

Probably a ton more takeaways.

I wouldn't be surprised if the team in the coming weeks just says something to the tune of ""This is too hard. We give up."" 

There's no incentive to work when they already made $70M.

How could we make future projects more accountable? 🤔"

#3. 3D art is hard — take your time to reveal.

From super yetis to HAPE Prime, we've seen how difficult 3D art is to generate.

@wolfdotgame is a perfect example of a project sticking with a strong narrative and communication style.

Each tweet and NFT drop adds to the lore of the game and makes the community feel immersed reading each new message from the Shepherd. https://t.co/bvweoPWsvu"

#2. Communication == Brand

Every post/image/comment/tweet is an indication of your brand and project creators should obsess over that.

Quality + thoughtfulness =&gt; trust in the brand."
29,"2/

Projects like @BoredApeYC and @RTFKTstudios continually underpromise and overdeliver.

Ape owners were surprised with MAYC and BAKC.

RTFKT holders have been rewarded with many valuable NFTs.

These projects will become household names because of their ability to execute."
30,"1/ 

#1. Underpromise. Overdeliver.

Art and design for marketing needs to be top notch for a project to sell out. 

However, it is equally important to make sure the generated NFTs match or exceed that quality.

Unless you just want to rug pull and commit fraud. 🤡"

That's it! Thanks for reading!

Starting tomorrow, I'm dropping a daily tweet on a new tokenomics insight with the hashtag: #azftokentips

Turn on those 🔔 so you don't miss them! 🪙"
53,"7/8

#7: Read more.

Rather than scrolling through Twitter for hours, take some time to read up on the newest projects or tokens.

Every new whitepaper you read adds to your ability to assess and evaluate the next project. 

You'll start thinking months ahead of the market."
54,"6/8

#6: Understand volatility and that it's near impossible to predict the future.

Projects I consult for often ask me if their tokenomics will make sense in 2025. 

I tell them not even the Fed with teams of Econ PhDs can predict the economy in 6 months, much less in 3 years."
55,"5/8

#5: Calculate utility to completion.

If a token has utility via burning, how much can be burned and for what purpose? Is there a date when the utility is complete?

Rather than being surprised, figure out the how incentives change as tokens get used and burned."
56,"4/8

#4: Figure out the loop holes.

Early on, whales figured out an arbitrage opportunity with $LOOKS and capitalized via wash trading.

If you can figure this out before others, you'll have an arbitrage opportunity.

The market always finds them. Can you find them first?"
57,"3/8

#3: Assess backwards from 30 days.

Does the reward system front load a ton of rewards? Does that mean there's a game of chicken for getting out?

Is there hype and attention that will die down?

Who will still be holding after 30 days? Who will be coming in?"
58,"2/8

#2: Evaluate with complete objectivity.

The market doesn't care about your bags or your feelings. Smart contracts and whitepapers are the law of the land.

You can come to the tokenomics with a perspective but understand what is fact and what is simply your opinion."
59,"1/8

#1: Read the whitepaper and docs.

I have a feeling 95% of you are holding NFTs/tokens you don't fully understand and only bought in because of Twitter hype.

NFTs and DeFi is like any other form of investment — you need to do your research and become informed."

Thanks for reading! Litepaper linked for more info.

So far, X2Y2 has dropped the ball communicating during the paused airdrop but $X2Y2 is pumping b/c high APR. 

Are you listing any NFTs on X2Y2? What other tokens would you like to see analyzed? https://t.co/X9In0XRnZC https://t.co/stgAMn4ycZ"
88,"16/17

$X2Y2 Summary
- Only worth claiming if &gt; 1ETH in volume
- 📉 whale incentives to generate trading volume on platform
- NFT listing rewards =&gt; 📈 listings
- Fair onboarding but no ambassadors to 📈 community trust
- Higher risk/ higher reward token than $LOOKS"
89,"15/17

This is a fantastic reward mechanism. If I’m going to list + sell my NFT, why not get free rewards just to list? 

This solves one side of the market and encourages people to list their NFTs. 

Biggest risk = calculating P. Could invite loopholes to generate $X2Y2."
90,"14/17

2. NFT listing (staking)

Unique to $X2Y2 is the ability to earn $X2Y2 by listing your NFT. 

They calculate rewards with a formula based on how likely your NFT will be sold —&gt; the underlying mechanic is yet to be revealed. https://t.co/aGJlhouzrD"
91,"13/17

What’s the impact of moving rewards from trading to staking?

- No wash trading =&gt; 📉 WETH rewards
- 📈 $X2Y2 rewards

=&gt; higher risk, higher reward bet 

Rewards mostly in $X2Y2 rather than split with WETH =&gt; ROI heavily correlated with $X2Y2 price"
92,"12/17

1. $X2Y2 staking

Here’s a breakdown of $X2Y2 staking emissions. Similar to $LOOKS, holders also get access to WETH market fees.

At the moment, b/c of artificial supply shock, the APR is insanely high —&gt; that will drop once more people get access to their $X2Y2. https://t.co/Ab9xziP0To"
93,"11/17

Claim #3: No trading rewards, only staking rewards

$LOOKS wash trading created inflated trading volume that benefited stakers with inflated WETH rewards.

$X2Y2 instead only rewards two types of staking: 

1. $X2Y2 staking
2. NFT listing

https://t.co/sLcMx4KjR3"
94,"10/17

Case in point today:

In order to fulfill the $X2Y2 airdrop claiming requirement, most people didn’t trust $X2Y2 and just listed a low quality NFT.

https://t.co/YUdYQCQ8qj"
95,"9/17

Strategic investors are not all bad.

Startups take money from @a16z / @sequoia for their network and expertise to grow product and business.

In $LOOKS case, people like @dingalingts were critical in building trust to connect our wallets to a completely new platform."
96,"8/17

Claim #2: No private sale

$LOOKS got a bad rep for giving whales a backroom deal.

$X2Y2 offered a public ILO (initial liquidity offering) where anyone could buy at $0.25 and lock $X2Y2 for 360 days (while still earning rewards). Fair 👍 

But AZF, what is the downside?"
97,"7/17

1. More traders != more volume

Smaller traders do not own $$$ NFTs =&gt; less $ trading volume

2. Fewer ""whales""

Capped 1,000 $X2Y2 =&gt; fewer incentives to move their entire portfolio into X2Y2 (bigger $LOOKS bag)

No $$$ NFTs listed =&gt; no big sales =&gt; minimal trading volume"
98,"6/17

Assuming conservative prices:

G1 = $30
G2 = $30
Y = $2

X &gt; (30+30)/33.33*2
X &gt; 0.9 ETH

To break even, you’ll want at least 1 ETH of trading volume to even consider claiming $X2Y2. 

$X2Y2 reaches more people than $LOOKS=&gt; Airdrop is more inclusive👍

What does this mean?"
99,"5/17

For those with &lt; 30 ETH volume, who should consider claiming $X2Y2? Let’s do some math

X = User Volume
Y = $X2Y2 price
G1 = Gas to list NFTs for claiming
G2 = Gas to claim $X2Y2

1000*(X/30)*Y - (G1 + G2) &gt; 0
1000*(X/30)*Y &gt; G1 + G2
X/30 &gt; (G1 + G2)/1000Y
X&gt; (G1+G2)/33.33Y"
