4,"@zachbussey Could be a metric for informing the recommendation algorithm in an attempt to focus on “active viewers” being most valuable, &amp; retaining them by recommending them to content that captures longer sessions times, but it would be shocking to institute that publicly facing for views."
5,@zachbussey That would be a rather harsh self imposed measurement of a quality view given how popular passive consumption of live streams are.

75,"Google Play as of Q1 ‘21 had about 3.48M apps, and iOS is at about 2.2M.

We have 7,000+ dApps on Polygon. 

We are early still, but we know where we’re going and we know what we’re striving for. 

Excited to support this wonderful dApp ecosystem at @polygonstudios."
