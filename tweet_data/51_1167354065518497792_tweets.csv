1,"Last year, I sold

20k $AXS at 0.64$
350k $SAND at 0.045$
20 #BAYC at 0.16E and 20 #BAYC between 0.5 and 3E

2,"@brycent_ @Pixelmon Projects need to have a better incentive to actually deliver on promises. The current market simply makes it to easy for them.

3,"So funny, we were discussing this project internally today. The trailer looks awful, some influencer tweets about it seem odd and it is a dutch auction with a 0.4E reserve price. Cashgrab. https://t.co/baRKbd2LSN"
4,"2/ To counter that there should be:
- Refund periods enforced by the smart contract
- Locked Funds for the team that unlock in stages based upon pre-defined milestones"
5,"1/ The Pixelmon disaster shows impressively how bad the current structure of NFT Sales/fund are. 

There is literally no incentive for founders to put in work after the sale because they already received all the funds. https://t.co/2Lt4jAIqi9"

10,"So if you are an aspiring game looking to partner with us, reach out before your raise/mint and not after the fact to urge us to buy on secondary for massive premiums from your favorite VC guilds. We wont be their exit liquidity."
11,We are a private guild and currently 70 members strong. We are Investors and Builders. Our purchase power exceeds most of the largest corporate guilds that you know.
12,"Lev0x is about creating a network, a family that helps each other and offers opportunities to each member in the form of shared knowledge and experiences in regards to NFT games. We are friends, investors and gamers that embark this journey together."
13,"In the case of Lev0x, we didnt raise any money. We invest our own money and thus have way higher conviction in the games we go into. Of course we are also investing to make a profit. But, we are builders and will build alongside these games because our incentives are aligned."
14,"They dont invest their own money, hence they dont have the conviction in your game other people have that invest personal funds. Thats why I believe that guilds like @Lev0x_eSports , @realdealguild and others will be more and more important for games."
15,This is true. Many of the newly formed corporate guilds with VC backing are money extraction machines with zero conviction in the games they invest. Many of them are structured after a top-down approach - a few people on top and a massive amount of scholars as bottom feeders. https://t.co/6DMAMGyJRM
16,@DiscoverXnft Do you need a job if you can spend 6-figures on metaverse land? 😛
17,"Really nice update by @AxieInfinity . The land sneak peak looks gorgeous! 

Looking forward to Origin and more Land updates. https://t.co/NdDKrRzTkh"
18,RT @DAVEvsAXIE: In case you missed the AMA with @crypto_unicorns founder @abearschmitt - the video is now uploaded to YouTube - we covered…
19,"When you think you cant get more bullish on a project, @DAVEvsAXIE makes such an interview with @abearschmitt ... Packed with leaks and information around the gameplay. Must watch if you are interested in @crypto_unicorns.🦄"
20,"@D1NOSAURUS_NFT @Lev0x_eSports Most games are still in development. Currently, mainly Axie, Pegaxy and Voxies I think."
21,@D1NOSAURUS_NFT @Lev0x_eSports Our members are invested in almost every popular and trustworthy NFT Game that comes to mind.
22,@DiscoverXnft Its not a fud thread. He's just summing up what was not actually written out in the docs. Everything he said was available info since the beginning.
23,"Ngl, pretty estatic to see how my team @Lev0x_eSports handled the Pegaxy hype wave. I never saw pegaxy as sustainable in its current form and we strategized around our thesis accordingly. gg wp"
24,"@manilacrypto1 @realdealguild Super happy for your success, keep pushing and building!"
25,Whitelists and how most projects use them as a distribution mechanic is probably the worst 'innovation' from 2021. https://t.co/J3N1LaqD3v
26,"@DarthSithius Sir, you realize that the staking contract holds over 80% of the Corn supply?"

28,"An $SLP buyback by the Axie team is a terrible idea for various reasons:

a) It will be frontrun by traders
b) It will be used as exit liquidity
c) It will barely have any effect unless it's HUGE...
... d) We dont want a huge buyback because of b)

Conclusion: Waste of funds."

32,"Could be extended to Origin axies as well, on a smaller scale."
33,"Seeing some uneasiness amongst high value asset holders in axie infinity lately because of the lack of utility for their assets.

What if Mystic Axies were able to earn AXS during battles or had a special quest with an AXS reward?

Thoughts?"

43,@aaronbronsteter Excellent. Looking forward to build my collection.
44,@rcosta50872320 @crypto_unicorns Unicorns + Metaverse = Cornverse
45,Making one of my biggest P&amp;E bets ever on @crypto_unicorns. Laguna Games is pursuing a big vision for an open Cornverse with multiple games. Proven game studio with a record of shipping games. Backed by the best in the industry. Bullish on the corns.
46,@Anorak_NFT I dont think so to be honest. Will believe it when the token is in my wallet.
47,@Schmiddel89 Schmidty the horseman
48,@cryptoChaz One of the most exciting games coming up.
49,"Making mistakes is part of growing. If you make mistakes, carry on and take them as a learning lesson. Stay rational, stay objective. There is nothing worse than making bad trading and investment decisions because of anger over past mistakes."

51,"We are all playing a big MMORPG. ETH are the chips everyone is trying to stack. 
Just like in real games, paying attention to the meta is crucial. PFPs might be the current meta, but what's next? 
Frontrun the meta."
52,. @wolfdotgame seems to develop staying power. I doubted it and didnt buy in but its cool to see how wolf game is on top of the game theory and a community forms around it. Seeing more and more wolves on my timeline. Very unique to watch. Kudos @beaniemaxi for the vision.
53,@ReadyPlayerRich Lots of good stuff to come this year that most people dont have on their radar yet
54,"MoonCats by @ponderware is a real historic project from 2017 that continues to ship and develop great things. They just announced that MoonCats will be fully on-chain. Always do your research and dont just follow influencer hypes, anon. https://t.co/iTFggfRDqy"
55,The action around @Crypto_Skulls is one of the most artificial hypes I've ever seen. There is nothing special or historical about that project. Have fun buying the bags of your favorite influencers at the peak. Pathetic.
56,@Schmiddel89 Ser...
57,@BinaryAssets @SuperNfty One of the hardest working artists in this space. Very happy for @SuperNfty .

59,"Im extremely bullish on NFT Gaming, yet I think it will be crucial to carefully navigate through all the noise. There is tons of hype and buzz and some projects will make millionaires while others will turn out as vaporware. Do your due dilligence and dont blindly follow the hype"
60,"Tokens pump based on narratives and speculation. In a bullmarket, the underlying fundamentals don't really matter if those two are taken care of."
61,"@ChuckFresco @AxieInfinity Can relate, when i still played it was not about farming SLP. It was about the competition and being on top of the leaderboard."
62,@ima_sac ✌
63,Happy Holidays everyone! Thanks @Lev0x_Onngusta for this beautiful Lev0x fam graphic https://t.co/IwijjdoU29

69,"@DeezeFi Still have 5 and a flame. Those guys have been building all the way, very impressive."
70,"@sillytuna Yeah, that is indeed bad. However, i think that light variants of pay to win are not necessarily bad for a play&amp;earn game. Some people need to pay others with money for progress and pay to win is the easiest approach to that. Cosmetics are another approach but need mass adoption."
71,@sillytuna What is your definition of pay to win? Would you consider Axie Infinity pay to win for instance?
72,@nixeniego @Schmiddel89 https://t.co/F83AQTK3lk

81,@AxieElon @nixeniego Was always a pleasure to kick @Indes_Axiegg ass. 😛
82,"@axie_global I believe player data will become a highly valued good within the play &amp; earn ecosystem. There will be dashboards, leaderboards and measuring systems to analyze a player's performance across games. Guilds will be competing for the best players."
83,@AxieElon @nixeniego Not sure which voice in youtube videos you are referring to 😛
84,NFT Games will behave like waves. Different projects are going to be hot at different times. Learn to become a surfer. 🏄‍♂️

86,"@Napoleon_TC @nbatopshot Me too, lets go. Love collecting these."
87,Cannot wait for every NFT game to have a trustless NFT renting feature built in. We need this.
88,@Moonlyght_Lev0x @ReadyPlayerDAO @Kouseiiin great job! 💪
89,"Play to earn Guild public raises are the new 2017 ICOs. Designed to extract as much value as possible from the market with the premise of a 'fair launch' by auction. Sorry anon, but your next favorite 3 month old guild founded by NFT gaming newbies isnt worth billions of dollars."
90,@Schmiddel89 lmao
91,Investors that operate with the 'FDV is a meme' rationale are going to find themselves in a portfolio rebalancing really soon.
92,@AxieAur @AxieInfinity https://t.co/oW7jwhVS6F
93,@GAMEEToken Will there be a renting system built into the app from the start/later?
94,@nixeniego @DarthSithius @crypto_unicorns Too much alpha in this tweet
95,"@ReadyPlayerRich I'm talking about the people that are consciously making the choice to rely on SLP as their main source of income, not the ones that have no choice. Ideally players have a job in the real world and Axie is a nice side income. Relying on SLP or similar tokens is dangerous."
96,"@ReadyPlayerRich It's not dismissive and elitist, it is the reality. Like it or not. Nobody should be relying on a hyper inflative utility token as their main source of income. Telling people otherwise is irresponsible."
97,"@cagyjan1 @the_YCB @AxieInfinity Building, releasing new features and developing the game does (which everybody knows is already happening)."
98,@cagyjan1 @the_YCB @AxieInfinity Spreading false hope helps nobody
99,@DiscoverXnft Many people still need to learn this lesson.
