15,"Why would they do that?

If you don't know, miners get block rewards. Their work is compensated with ether."

18,"Often, smart contracts are complex and calling a method could lead to failed transactions and losing funds.

Sometimes externally calculated inputs are required that you can’t calculate yourself."

69,"The message is:

Using NFTs you don't have copyrights of commercially is no different than doing the same with plain JPEGS on the internet."
70,"People could've commercially used those images before but he wouldn't realize as they're probably printed somewhere he can't get access to or just can't even know where.

With NFTs everyone can see it and it's easy to check."
71,"No one can stop people downloading copyrighted images and using them in their designs, or downloading copyrighted materials from P2P networks.

You just have to live with it."
72,"But it's bad that people can make money using other person's work.

How do we stop it?

We can't."

If you're the original author, even if someone mints it and gets some money from it, it usually won't be as relevant as if minted from you."

That subtle difference is a key feature of NFTs. 

Unless you lose your keys or get scammed with a fake transaction, no one can steal your NFTs."

But people need to understand that minting something you don't own copyrights of is not stealing.

It's a non-allowed commercial usage.
