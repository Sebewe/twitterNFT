2,"7/ If you are an artists interested in using the poster tool, you can submit here: https://t.co/nvQ0Ucrgb0"
3,6/ All NFTs are on the Polygon network which means they are environmentally-friendly and have tiny gas fees to interact with.
4,5/ Fans are now collectors with their own wallet and their (often) first ever NFT. The path to selling an NFT to these collectors is much shorter.
5,"4/ These ERC-1155 NFTs can be used to easily token-gate experiences like merch drops, ticket pre-sales, access to discord servers, or invites to live events. Essentially they can act as building blocks for your community."
6,3/ @mintsongs recently launched a dashboard that gives access to all collectors’ emails and wallets for the artist to engage with them directly.
7,2/ The poster tool gives fans an easy way to collect their first NFT by simply entering their email address. No need to setup a wallet or buy crypto.

30,"7/ Nurture these relationships with your biggest supporters. They showed up for you, so return the favor. This ethos is key to creating a sustainable web3 community."
31,"6/ Gamify your collection. If a fan collects a certain # of NFTs in a series, combination, or all of them, reward them with extra utility. You can create tiers of rewards based on their collection behavior."
32,5/ Create your music NFT drop on @mintsongs. You can do this for $0 in gas fees and set the number of editions and price per edition. Activate your community to collect these NFTs (good fans will see the value in art). Spell out any utility collectors will receive by buying.
33,4/ Engage with your new community. Discord is the best place to do this. Be transparent in how you How you interact with your fans is completely up to you.
34,"3/ Create a plan to reward collectors. Think of the NFT as a membership pass, anyone who holds one should get something special. Access to a discord channel, free merch, ticket pre-sale, etc. The sky is the limit but the point is that collectors feel the value in collecting."
35,"2/ Setup a Posters campaign. This is a free NFT giveaway that onboards your fans en masse. To claim, the fan enters their email. We sign them up to @mintsongs,issue them a non-custodial wallet (if they need one), and drop the NFT in the wallet. Your community is now +1"
