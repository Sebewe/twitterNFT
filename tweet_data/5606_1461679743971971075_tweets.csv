91,"@BobbyBananasNFT It’s true, people want them back because they pump their bags so they turn a blind eye. A lot of people in this space are in it for the “art” but if that were the case floor price wouldn’t matter and having “influencers” pump bags wouldn’t be needed, doxxed or not"
92,"@BobbyBananasNFT Another thing to add, how many doxxed people in this space pull shady shit and then are welcomed back with open arms two weeks later? Even the bitconnect people were doxxed and people still listen to what they say. https://t.co/8Vk6Uf4hhs"
93,"@BobbyBananasNFT A lot of people think that just because someone is doxxed that they won’t take advantage of people, prison is full of doxxed people that get out and take advantage of people every day."
