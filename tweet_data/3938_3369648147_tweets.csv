6,"@prekesh Personally, I definitely have a sentimental attachment to some NFTs I own. Some I would be more than happy to cash out on but I can’t bring myself to sell. 

There are far more interesting things happening in the “web3” space than just flipping NFTs tho"
7,"@prekesh If you surround yourself with the people building in the space and not with people just talking about ""cryptocurrency"", It becomes a hell of a lot more obvious what the potential value of it might be."
8,@nnnnicholas @0xChoco @0xmons lol obv meant to say owensea here🤦🏻‍♂️
9,"@nnnnicholas @0xChoco @0xmons Yeah there is.

1. View a 0xmon on Opensea (e.g. https://t.co/9tcdebdcUA)
2. Change “opensea” in URL to “opensea”
3. You get redirected to sudoswap"
10,@js_horne is it really defi if it doesn’t have protocol native ponzinomics?
11,@ericjuta and people out here paying 30-40% in tax. so nearly 100% of net salary 👀
12,@BrantlyMillegan @benjitaylor actually wanted to bring in ENS subdomains by default for @unionprotocol members. But we were thinking activities carried out by bad actors under these subdomains could be seen as bad for the primary ENS rep. Any thoughts on this?
13,@damedoteth this is the dumbest thing I’ve seen in a while
14,@MindaugasLT @JackieMJensen @iamemilyleahy I was only thinking about you the other day. We need to link

23,Let’s go back to $80 ETH
24,@ianDAOs @jongold You kind of get doxxed to some extent just by working in the space imo
25,@ianDAOs @jongold Different wallets for different things with no connection to each other 👍 But the problem here is the majority will not be aware of these basic security practices
26,@danbarkle I never got on with Semplice. I’d pick Webflow

43,Remembering @CryptoKaijuIO now who I think launched with an ERC-721 / Physical with NFC based metadata. So not the first but _one of_ for sure.
44,"Launched by @ourZORA and created by @benjitaylor &amp; @kevindoann what feels like a decade ago in NFT time (actually no more than 18 months ago), this RUX toy might be one of the first “Toy” NFT’s I’m aware of https://t.co/RPpsfUNv9l"

48,@jstn @jbrukh @BrantlyMillegan Yeah; fair and I’ve wondered this myself. Potentially it’s due to clashing with TLD’s?
49,@jstn @jbrukh I see @BrantlyMillegan’s comment — works with any domain 👀
50,@jstn I recently learned via @jbrukh that you can set .xyz domains as your ENS (if you didn’t know already)

55,"@avsa @geraldh0st @unionprotocol @LefterisJP @jbrukh @TrustlinesFound @tl_validator Not to mention activities such as ""golden tickets"" disregard the inherent risk involved in unsecured lending. The ""Ring of Trust"" is an experiment in providing vouches in a more simple way and there will be more experiments in the future 🙂 https://t.co/d37ePnsnai"
56,"@avsa @geraldh0st @unionprotocol @LefterisJP @jbrukh @TrustlinesFound @tl_validator Unfortunately it's not this simple. Vouches are onchain and currently 3 vouches are a hard requirement in becoming a member of Union. A ""golden ticket"" would require 3 separate transactions and would be costly on L1."
57,"@avsa @unionprotocol @LefterisJP @jbrukh @TrustlinesFound @tl_validator Thanks for the feedback. There are a ton of things we can do to improve onboarding. I'd like to integrate a more meaningful flow which provides base level info before a user attempts to ""Become a member"" and potentially directs users to the right chain Kovan/Mainnet/L2"
