30,"8/ Want to Buidl or Invest in #web3? 
Pros and cons of each:

https://t.co/EHBrILxS3K"
31,4/ How you weight these different factors is up to you. I came out with Buidl but that will be different for everyone!
32,"3e/ Other cool investors like @AlokVasudev have a deep technical understanding, will riff on ideas with you and give you thoughtful feedback."
33,"3d/ 
E.g. 1 @danrobinson co-authored @Uniswap V3 
E.g. 2 @gakonst &amp; team developed Foundry, a set of Ethereum development tools"
34,"3d/ Because there are few investment opportunities relative to capital, investors need to offer more than just capital.

Top Crypto VCs like @paradigm are have research teams to help their investments w/ mech design, smart contract security, eng, recruiting &amp; reg strategy."
35,3c/ It is hard to grow your team as a buidler because there are still few people working in web3.
36,"3b/ The rapidly changing market can swing in your favor:

@OpenSea’s monthly trading volume went from $8m to $2.5b in less than 12 months.

https://t.co/s7XK15j6xH (@richardchen39)

Or against you:

Zcash tokens are trading at &lt;1/4 of their 2017-18 high"
37,"3a/ Why Invest &gt; Buidl?

Diversify your bets. Most start ups fail. This may be exacerbated by how rapidly Crypto changes. 

Investors make many investments, if one fails, others remain. Entrepreneurs get one at a time. If it fails, then you must start again."
38,2c/ This means that you can face a lot less competition as an entrepreneur than an investor!
39,"2b/ Very little competition compared with Web2 - a lot of people talk about and invest in Crypto, but very few build. @ElectricCapital found that there are only 18k active Web3 developers. According to @EvansDataCorp there are 27m software developers in the world. This is 0.07%! https://t.co/fCtBSbmWek"
40,"2a/ Why Buidl &gt; Invest?

Lots of available $$$ - a lot of capital is trying to invest in Crypto and valuations are sky high! @GalaxyDigitalHQ found that in 2021, VCs invested $33bn in the space and more in Q4 2021 than in all of 2020. https://t.co/cNX14OTzex"

76,@adamjacksonsf Thanks Adam - appreciate it!
77,"10/ Check out @a16z's crypto start up school and tweets by @cdixon and @alive_eth for more on how user incentives are different in Web3 to Web2.

https://t.co/eSylTYxWb6"
78,"9/ Well how will Web2 companies compete? 

1. Offering more incentives to early and high volume users (e.g. better loyalty schemes) to discourage them from shifting to Web3. 

2. Better UX, as @moxie says centralization allows platforms to improve faster &amp; respond to UX feedback."
79,"8/ In Web3, protocols can just give that value directly to users, whose continued engagement arguably provides more value to the protocol, than the investors do."
80,"7/ Does this reduce the need for growth stage capital? Maybe.

Many Web2 consumer-facing marketplaces raise funding in return for equity, to ‘scale’.

Scaling is often code for marketing $ to acquire users."
81,"6/ @adamjacksonsf's  @usebraintrust is one of the first examples of a decentralized marketplace, owned by its users and builders.

I hope to see many more decentralized consumer-facing marketplaces in the future."
82,"5/ This is the crucial part. Early Web3 protocol users get financial upside previously reserved for institutional investors!

This incentivizes them to stay engaged because if the token price keeps going up, they make more money!"
83,"4/ In a Web3 Doordash with a finite token supply and a token with an in-application use (e.g. you pay for your meal in $DOOR token and drivers are paid in $DOOR), the value of that token should rise as the number of users and transaction volume grows."
84,"3/ For example, early Doordash drivers likely owned no Doordash equity despite playing an important role in the Company’s growth."
85,2/ Community Ownership means that Users and Contributors of a Web3 platform will own more of it in Web3 than they would have in the Web2 equivalent.
86,"1/ You've probably heard Web3 = Community Ownership. 

What does that mean?
