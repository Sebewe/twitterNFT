87,@Suhail @gfodor There's already dozens of integrations directly into the Uniswap contracts that bypass the front end. This really isn't web2 where there's only one front end that everyone uses. If a bad actor were to compromise the front end domain word would spread within a few hours.
88,@Suhail @gfodor Neither of those statements is accurate in a material way. Uniswaps front end is now hosted on IPFS and is only one of many ways to access it (you can run your own or use anyone else's). And the onchain code deployment is now governed by community votes and not the core team.
89,@Suhail Some crypto verticals have decentralized (eg. Uniswap trading and Aave/Compound lending) and they show 10x efficiency improvements vs. centralized architectures (see exponential growth since launch in 2018). NFT marketplaces are harder but not impossible to pull off.
