15,@therealtblake @tropoFarmer @discord Wait is that on mobile only?
16,@therealtblake @tropoFarmer @discord What? Where?
17,"@mattmedved As a platform, it is so early and has barely scratched the surface of its potential.

Some projects have high upside from here, no doubt. There is a lot of quality available.

Many are not investible either at the moment. Pick right and that's what matters."
18,"@tropoFarmer @discord Let's not stop there!

Give me a dashboard that shows all my mentions that I can click into, which takes me directly to what I need to see.

Add in customization (of what you are asking for) with quick access to the most important channels in your most important servers"
19,"@bryanbrinkman Just, no."
20,@VinnieHager Swag.
21,"The best I've got is UST on Terra with 19.5% APY, it's liquid, I avoid gas, I can cash to fiat easily through a centralized exchange. I've been looking for Ethereum answers for a while and I've got pretty much nothing /6"
22,"Dang Twitter glitched out on me I wasn't ready to post that, anyways...

TLDR I'm really trying here to find some yield on stables in defi, but legit the cost of using Ethereum is so prohibitive that it makes even 5-8% yields not worth it /5"
23,"Like, here's a typical person's dilemma:

Pay gas to swap ETH for stETH, earn &gt;5% APY, wait 1 month to earn back the cost of gas, if not longer

or

Pay gas, buy NFT for ~0.5eth, hopefully, sell NFT in 20 minutes for ~0.7eth or more."
24,"No wonder all anyone wants to do is trade NFTs. You can make 2x or more returns in a day.

One good whitelist and you 10x instantly. I did it on 3Landers and Wonderpals."
25,"Where are the good L2 stable options 😒

And is it even worth wrapping on to an L2 yet? Not like I can send my ETH from that L2 to a CEX and cash out.

By the time you wrap your ETH, stake, and unwrap, most people lose more in gas than they've made in yield. /2"
26,"ETH is such a whales network.

Even if I deposited $30k USDC into @NotionalFinance for a month, after gas fees I'd make next to nothing. /1 https://t.co/ru2HjbXJTS"

36,@andrwwang Love this wow
37,"@ElectionDayMad1 @TheSmarmyBum @tropoFarmer There’s still the “mystery” value factor too though, like you said! If you never “wrap” your doodle to a spaceship, that NFT hasn’t been created yet, so any future buyer would be in for the surprise if they chose to wrap one day."

39,@DeezeFi Grail tweet tho deeze
40,"@TheSmarmyBum @ElectionDayMad1 @tropoFarmer It still exists though, just tested it. It gets deposited into this wallet: 0x620b70123fb810f6c653da7644b5dd0b6312e4d8 when you send it back"
41,"@TheSmarmyBum @ElectionDayMad1 @tropoFarmer Search the ID number of the Doodle on OS in Space Doodles, see if it exists."
42,"@ElectionDayMad1 @TheSmarmyBum @tropoFarmer Yeah, not really sure a common spaceship will de-value a rare doodle but do agree maybe the ""unknown"" spaceship factor might increase its value - but what's the fun in that!?"
