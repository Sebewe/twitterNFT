11,"(4/4) In order to run a weak-link team, you have to trust that each member is doing their best work on their position and constantly hold people accountable for it. More importantly, you need to default to action if a team has a weak link."
12,"(3/4) A weak-link team can fail if it has one bad player. Think of soccer or football. If a team has one bad defensive player, the team can lose no matter how great the offence is. This type of team requires a high level of trust and talent density."
13,(2/4) A strong-link team relies on one superstar hire to win. Think of basketball as an example. If you got LeBron James on your side you may win a game regardless of who else is on the court. That’s not how we operate.
14,"Things I learned at Shopify Ep.2

(1/4) There are two fundamentally different modes of teamwork: Strong-link teams and weak-link teams. The latter requires lots of discipline and attention, but leads to much higher talent density.

17,(4/4) It you get more than seventy percent of the information you need to make the decision then the opportunity has usually passed and someone else has beaten you to the punch.
18,(3/4) If you make a decision with less than forty percent of the information you need you are shooting from the hip and you will make too many mistakes.
19,(2/4) Every time you face a tough decision you should have no less than forty percent and no more than seventy percent of the information you need to make the decision.
20,"Things I learned at Shopify Ep.1

(1/4) The Colin Powell 40-70 rule is one of the most effective ways to make a decision at the right moment. There is no time for decision paralysis at a hyper growth company.
