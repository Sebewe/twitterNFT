42,"@Voxmon_io Cool, and will the asset be the original 2d image or the voxelized image?"
43,because TikTok's algorithm is very good at finding the perfect content for you based on your usage of the app.
44,"(1) They've only spent 10 minutes on there and haven't given the algorithm time to find what their interests are

(2) The only videos they spend time on, interact with, and rewatch are videos of teenage girls dancing to the same song"
45,"When people critique TikTok for only seeing teenage girls dancing to the same song, you can be sure one of two things is happening.. 👇"
46,@rexwub A nice little 24hr consolidation then an extra healthy leap up to 20eth would be great
47,"@Voxmon_io Love this idea.

Question: will there be only 500 genesis tokens total, or 500 genesis voxmon w/ multiple tokens for each voxmon?  My understanding of 1155 standard is limited and not sure what a normal launch of a project that uses 1155 looks like."

66,"This is probably my favorite piece I've made so far.  Took about a day to write, figure out &amp; debug the line packing algorithm. It wasn't easy but it was well worth it.  #generativeart

It took 20min to render &amp; had 16B collision checks.

Up next: learn about circle packing and line packing

Shout out to @DegenArtClub &amp; @L3xcNFT for some amazing resources in their discord

76,"@mikegan_ I could imagine people taking a photo in each country they visit over the course of a decade or every mountain they summit, or every birthday they have. It could be like perfectly preserved capsules of life experience over long swaths of time."
77,@mikegan_ This actually sounds like a pretty cool idea.. 👀
78,@whorobby_ @coolcatsnft This is the funniest looking cat I've seen looooool
79,"@mikegan_ I could imagine celebrities buying these to release their ""NFT"" collections w/o any real effort.  

Imagine tom brady taking a photo of him with the trophy after the superbowl, how much would that go for?"
80,"@mikegan_ It would be funny if someone made a smart disposable camera that would do this.  

Probably wouldn't actually be disposable but just the quality of a disposable camera.  

Or maybe it is disposable in the sense that each wallet only can take 40 photos or something."

82,@fleeb_eth @doodles Damn these memes move quick
83,"@L3xcNFT fun colors, are you using some type of circle packing algorithm here?"
84,@doodles This reminds me of that racoon cannon game.
