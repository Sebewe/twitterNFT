64,"@zudasworld @iwwon_official I have to agree with @zudasworld here. Telling people ""don't use opensea it's exploited, use something else"" only does harm to the whole space. A more conservative ""avoid listing for a few hours until the issue has been investigated"" could go a long(er) way."
65,"There needs to be some development on the tooling of the NFT space. We see gazillions of projects but not much progress has been made in securing the space other than telling people ""don't click on links that you don't trust"" and ""We will never DM you first""."
66,"🧵3/3
- Most project websites are built using React. Cloning a react website is a matter of copy pasting its code from the developer console in Chrome. Changing the contract that it points to, is changing one line there."
67,"🧵2/3
- Opensea, the biggest marketplace at the moment is not only unstable, changing the course of projects depending whether it is up or not, it is also the biggest target for exploits."
68,"🧵1/3
The more I get into the NFT space, the more obvious it gets that there is a need for more secure services.
- Discord scams come and go by dozens every day, discord is not built for this web3 craziness."
