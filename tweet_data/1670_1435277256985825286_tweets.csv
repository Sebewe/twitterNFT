32,"A note on this piece in particular: the ""Classic"" color palette will always hold a special place in my heart - it was the first and only color scheme I was using when I first developed this algorithm 3-4 years ago. Plus the black and white is just so minimal and elegant"
33,"Highly encourage people to go back and revisit their Atlanta pieces - really reminded me why I was so proud of making them in the first place. 

They end up being much more than just shapes moving around a screen - but only if you allow yourself to immerse"
34,"When Atlanta was released, I put out a disclaimer to ""view each piece for at least 45 seconds to allow deeper, more satisfying patterns to emerge""

I hadn't followed that advice in a while, but I recently stumbled on this piece and really allowed myself to get mesmerized... wow"

36,"Also just love this ""Chess"" color palette - the off-white and off-black combo I find super pleasing!"
37,"the checkerboard-y pattern in there was actually the first pattern I made for this project. Absolutely adore it, but ended up having to make it rare, since it is super heavy processing-wise and I was worried people would have issues rendering their pieces if it were too common"
38,"been going back through some old Kinesis outputs, and realized some of these never really got shared or talked about much. Time to rectify that! gonna be posting and writing about some fav Kinesis pieces over the next few days
