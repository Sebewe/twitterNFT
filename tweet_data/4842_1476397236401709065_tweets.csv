54,@joshbobrowsky @sartoshi_nft @MasterChanX Excellent point - I also see a transfer in ownership from the “dev” to the community regarding “value”.  A community’s value is made up of the value it’s members bring to the table.  Plenty of talented mfers in THIS group.
55,"@joshbobrowsky I think of this in terms of the historical significance of the project within the space at a given point in time. Most chasing rarity, utility, alpha - mfers focusing on the value of community in an organic and meaningful way.  It’s been fun, mfer. @sartoshi_nft @MasterChanX"
