11,@OGDfarmer @juda_juda_ If you own a cat you can send the pet to the guild and earn slightly less $milk/day than questing with the pet - eventually will be able to rent out the pet to other players. Current Estimates are about 550 milk EV from max quests and 200-300 milk/day from guild. Cats 1000+ milk

32,@tommyk_eth @Twitter @BoredApeYC @niftygateway @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains sub domains feel like a great spot for this? I.e if I own Cloudbcool.eth where my assets are but also own a.cloudbcool.eth - would be nice to verify ownership from the subdomain address with ownership proven by simple fact that it is a sub domain sig?
33,@tommyk_eth @Twitter @BoredApeYC @niftygateway makes sense - I love the idea of self custody but agree the benefits of full custodial wallet are nice- more need to be done in the space to allow verification of asset ownership without opening up the wallet where the asset actually resides
34,"@tommyk_eth @Twitter @BoredApeYC @niftygateway Fair - can you still keep acccess to claiming things like mutants or merch or whatever event tickets, etc that usually require a self custodied wallet signature?"

47,@backseats_eth @coolcatsnft Yea (I hope I’m not misremembering) but I swear it was mentioned on a town hall - don’t see any info on cooltopia page though
48,@backseats_eth great chart! one thing this doesnt account for those is the ability of higher tier cats to send multiple pets to the adventurers guild to earn $milk - I dont know if they were specific with the #'s but there was a @coolcatsnft  townhall recently where they mentioned this feature
49,So you’re telling me. That not only did we not get a 👑king crown/robe combo in the original #BAYC or subsequent #MAYC but we couldn’t even produce one in the community expansion @0xApes_NFT ?! Can the devs do something please! https://t.co/zzW1NSvw4w
