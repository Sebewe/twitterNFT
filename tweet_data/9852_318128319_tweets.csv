1,The artists are assembling and it’s going to be a perfect night at @SuperchiefNFT Los Angeles on Friday to kick off “A Perfect Day”! #APerfectDay #WomenInNFTs https://t.co/zy9zPMOGgM
2,@Ang_Ramm Heck yes! You deserve all the good things.
3,"@sloikaxyz @blakerandall81 Absolutely gorgeous. Hudson River School paintings are some of my faves, and now so are these."
4,@jvcesnipes @a1111ac011d0 @artcade_gg @strasvision @withFND How convenient then that I’ll be in town Friday for a gallery exhibition and my hotel is 2.7 miles away 😎🤘💅 thanks!!
5,@a1111ac011d0 @artcade_gg @strasvision @jvcesnipes @withFND Omg is that a REAL PLACE?! It looks magical.
6,@travelingelf Green you say? Perhaps the most ridiculous NFT I have for sale has some green ice plant. 🤣 https://t.co/EZHGnFFgBe https://t.co/QnlJ56MEBF

8,@eswiftstudios Congrats! Just followed and sent the link to the film folks I know. I’m just back into shooting film and I know where I’m sending it. 🥰
9,RT @gabbagallery: This Week @RebelDread releases his amazing documentary https://t.co/dcHFQoGOnL The Story of Don Letts.   Just wait until…
10,@a1111ac011d0 I loooooooove the image you’ve included in our exhibition. Thanks so much for participating. I’m sad I won’t be meeting you in person yet! Someday. :)
11,"It’s so funny, I was looking at all these amazing artists doing good work for Ukraine, and my first thought was “I hope to be well-known enough someday to be invited to donate to these types of things!” (It’s not all about the $: the more you have, the more you can share 🥰) https://t.co/b5enkrcct4"
12,@EveLittleShell Yay and I’m your 100th follower also. 🥰 Happy to have your work in the exhibition.
13,"@TheMajor_eth I could not have imagined a life as weird and interesting as mine, had I ever tried to imagine a future for myself."
14,@MorganStoneee Cheers to the Big Roo. 🥰 #rootyroo
15,"@cpprstatestorms We just posted it on Twitter, and I also put it on one or two women's Discord servers for artists. I know, it's kind of the luck of the draw if you're on twitter that day! I'm half-tempted to save a search for ""call for art"" or the like...I'm sure i miss a lot of `em too."
16,@DopplerJess @LeslieASpurlock I’ll take photos of everything!
17,"@DopplerJess I can't wait to meet you in person! Thanks for sharing your gorgeous art with us. I keep going back and staring at it (as someone who lives where there's basically no weather, haha)."
18,"@blkgrlcrypto Thank you for being with us, it's an honor to have you. And hey, yeah! Women's Month! Let's kick it off for sure."
19,@Trealxoxo Thanks for sharing your beautiful art with us. &lt;3
20,"@SuperchiefNFT @redactedpride @seeonawhim Thank you! It's going to be fabulous. 38 amazing photographers, each with their own interpretation of a perfect day. This exhibition is full of loving, happy, and hopeful photographs, and good stories too. We always need art to keep us going in difficult times. &lt;3"
21,"It's happening! I'm so excited, all the work is paying off and there's gorgeous images from 38 talented women in the NFT community ready to rock your world and provide a moment of artistic respite and recharge. #WomenInNFTs #APerfectDay https://t.co/XTyqZnRkin"
22,"Having a heated mattress pad is incredible. I turn it on an hour or so before bed, and then turn it off right as I jump into my deliciously warm bed. It’s a little luxury that feels so good for my mental health. (I’m in the “need all the help I can get” camp with that rn)"
23,@redactedpride I love LA so much. I grew up about an hour north but didn’t really appreciate it while I lived down there. Such a great food town.
24,@justinaversano @sergitosergito Yeah!!! I have one of the 1/5 scrolls of The Hermit. It’s such a great image and a cool project.
25,@havalauv @MorganStoneee I got tree fiddy and a giant sack of weed
26,"@DataNFT_ I’ve tried it again since. No go. I get migraines and it comes with motion nausea with stuff like this. I’m fine never doing VR stuff, honestly. I like actual reality. ☺️"
27,"@DataNFT_ Nope. They make me nauseous and apparently the only decent one is owned by FB. When I was in college in the late 90s,  I was a NASA lab rat for extra $ and they put me in a giant helmet-and-cables early VR and did experiments. Until I almost barfed on it. 🤣"
28,@redactedpride Good night!! Sleep well after all your travels today.
29,"It feels strange to be talking about NFTs when there’s such awful things happening to Ukraine. Art can soothe our hearts, however, and keep us going. This exhibition is full of loving, happy, and hopeful photographs, and good stories too. We always need art. https://t.co/B2aeIzkaqa"
30,"I’m getting excited for the opening of “A Perfect Day” all-women NFT photography exhibition at @SuperchiefNFT Los Angeles, one week away! More info coming soon. @redactedpride and I are finalizing the layout and details now and it’s looking so great. 🥰 #WomenInNFTs"

34,"@raven50mm It seems there’s a bunch of folks in the world who are eager to pull down anyone who is happy in ways that are foreign to them. Or who don’t fear the same things they see as absolute immutable fears. (Backwards religious stuff, etc)."
35,@AssEfectivo @TheCoffeeBlock Pffth. There’s no women on the internet. 😒
36,@Swopes I just cackled out loud. https://t.co/JvEnjHB9Le

38,@natalie_santafe Always lovely when a collector advocates for you!
39,"@redactedpride Damn, that one is rad."

45,@Tylers_journey @travelingelf Aww. Two good people making nice feelings at each other. Makes me happy 🥰
46,"@arria_library Honestly I think there’s about a million more critical issues in the space, and don’t fault artists for wanting money and acclaim. At all. That wasn’t my point. These projects don’t even seem to center art, the ones I saw had generic art and seemed more like cash grabs."
47,"@ClaireSilver12 @Tylers_journey @CozomoMedici @bonafidehan @deekaymotion Heck yeah, Claire!! Get it. &lt;3"

50,"As an introvert, self-promotion is difficult for me. But I’m super proud of this collection and there’s only 2 images left for sale. I’m honored and delighted that my collectors for this series include @justinaversano, @YamashitaPhoto, and @cryptohydrate. 🥰 https://t.co/Fpn3fCIPTP"
51,"@davidleonardtv @artnome @atMikeyWilson I can see both sides of this. I also look at the word support as in, do I support your mission of making art? Of self-expression? Support can come in many ways: $, attention, enthusiasm for the work. As an artist, someone collecting my work blows my mind and keeps me going. 🥰"
52,@dhanish_mkp @Tylers_journey @JoOttey @NataDarlex That’s a gorgeous image!
53,@Tylers_journey Hey Tyler! I have two images left in my fog collection on Sloika until SOLD OUT. Super exciting. ☺️ 0.15 ETH. This one is called “spider nest” and was a great morning at a wildlife refuge. https://t.co/73sorC3GTW https://t.co/ENQo3fyFBL

55,"Wow, every time I check out the designated shill channel on Discord servers it’s just full of garbage projects?! I admire the hustle but…it also kinda makes me sad at all the energy going into nonsense."
56,"@fewocious I want to give you one million hugs. I’ll be your internet mom if you need one, and tell you I’m proud of you and you’re worthy of all the good things you’ve created for yourself. 💜💜💜💜🌈"

58,@MorganStoneee @RooTroopNFT All my stocks are down bad. Crypto down bad. Other projects steady or have already gone to almost zero. Roos are basically the only profitable investment in my whole damned life 🤣🤣
59,This looks amazing. As a photographer that sometimes struggles with “why”…I’m gonna be on this like a rat on a Cheeto. https://t.co/k9nj2DehG5
60,"@HawkwardArt Same. I’ll do a project, then rest and gather my energy while maintaining a low hum of energy until it’s time to ramp up again. Some folks are just grind-constantly and then they bonk."

62,"@MorganStoneee @RooTroopNFT Got my box o’roos (5 minted, one snagged off floor at reveal) and ready to go. I love how HAPPY you are about @RooTroopNFT, I’ve seen other founders be hyped but this feels different. More like you’re trying to lift everyone up with you. 🥰 https://t.co/UWvVv3hm9H"
63,"@andrwwang Absolutely. I’ve struggled as a woman photographer for 20 years, talked down to and dismissed by older male photographers. This is the first place I feel welcomed, and by far where I’ve had the most success (even if still a teeny little polite success!). 🥰"
64,"@dave_krugman @ClaireSilver12 That’s a fabulous way to say that, thank you. I’d been trying to figure out a way to describe it. I’m 40 now but can probably still get away with saying ‘vibes’ because I’m from California and also say ‘stoked’ and ‘rad’ 🤣"
65,"@God23Notorious @MorganStoneee I love that this was the tweet right below it in my feed, from @DataNFT_ 🤣🤣 https://t.co/J4piXKOHR6"
66,@cryptohydrate That sounds like a wonderful day! Mmmm cheeseburgers and home improvement. 👍
67,@danhawkphoto @tchebotarev @AlphaTrilogy @NiftyMetaGirl @MetaJungleNFT This is my question too! I only have 2 photos remaining in my collection (!!) but maybe they’re just waiting for the perfect collector who wants this type of license 🙃🥰
68,Gm! We did a drive early this morning out to the Central Valley to check out the almond orchards in bloom. So gorgeous! So much water usage 👀 https://t.co/sSTDXHFui0
69,"@GalleryStellar What does ASAP mean in human time, is there a real deadline? By when will you let people know if they’ve been selected? Thank you!"
70,"@MariahD_2021 Hi! Just followed you, always nice to see other women in the space. ☺️ I have a collection on Sloika that you may like! https://t.co/73sorClhLu"
71,@ARTJEDI1 Yeah! Thanks for the reminder. Trying to be here on top of my full time job and actually trying to photograph sometimes…it’s a lot. It’s FUN but it’s also a lot! ☺️
72,"@tchebotarev @manifoldxyz Good to know! Sadly not a big-ish project $-wise that I'm involved with, just trying to ponder avoiding minting onto OpenSea's shared contract as I've heard some collectors are now reluctant to buy from it. (my current success w/Sloika vs my other work on OS would agree?!)"
73,@ZeroskinsA How about you don't shill in inappropriate places?
74,"Does anyone know if you can do shared collection contracts on @manifoldxyz (like, for a group exhibition with each artist minting onto the contract and a sale percentage going to both the artist + gallery)? #SmartContracts"
75,"Gm! Still two photos remaining in this collection- a kinda creepy hyperfog morning in a bird sanctuary, and a surface fog morning in Big Sur. Both gorgeous and waiting for new homes. Thanks for looking! 🥰 https://t.co/8S0OoKEcgv"
76,@swpafire @YamashitaPhoto @sloikaxyz Thanks Steve!!!! 🥰 I appreciate you taking a look and enjoying.
77,@redactedpride Mine has traditionally been Tower of Power hailing from out here in Oakland…I’ll check that out! Thanks 👍
78,"@jeffexcell Hi Jeff! Thanks 🥰 I’d love if you could RT my collection of fog photos? On a custom contract via Sloika. I have TWO photos left for sale in the collection, and I’ve never sold out a collection before. This one is gonna be it, because it’s rad. https://t.co/73sorClhLu https://t.co/vwS6G2O0E2"
79,@danhawkphoto @fastwideslow ok that's BADASS.
80,"@redactedpride @misanharriman If his photographic eye is as kind to you as his heart seems to be, that portrait should go in the Louvre."
81,@CozomoMedici @GBMedici No artists? Interesting choice.
82,"@travelingelf WTF. Instant follow! (@travelingelf , you retweet the best stuff &lt;3 thanks for the dopamine"
83,"@tchebotarev As a photographer, I'd be fine without that first sentence.  I think if @AlphaTrilogy wants to buy my photographs and display them in an art space, that would be rad. I've spent 20 years with most of my photography on my hard drive. Pay me for it and then party on with eyeballs."
84,Hell yes. @DrifterShoots just gave the most amazing monologue about the struggle and rewards of being an introspective artist. I had to stop what I was doing and just sit quietly and listen. https://t.co/yQAaUQaVAa
85,"@MorganStoneee Whoa. THAT BT, the soundtrack to my 2005-era warehouse raves? Huh. 👀"
86,@sloikaxyz @landscapesbyLT Absolutely gorgeous. I’ve spent some time there myself and I know how difficult it is to get great photos. And then these perfect edits? Magical. 🥰

95,@missevaphoto Hey from my bed where I’m also high on migraine meds. Solidarity! 🥰
96,"@lphaCentauriKid Heck yeah, why wouldn’t people cheer? Celebrating others doesn’t push us down, to me it feels like just the opposite. Celebrating abundance and good news inclines our minds to positivity. Which in turn sets us up for good things! 🌈💜"
