I wanted to sell my previous ape during the 100-110 E floor run (it was a clean 4T), but I couldn't find any buyer who offers a fair value. But I did trade down my ape, for my current dmt with merch + 37.5 E. Not the best trade I've done, but not the worst as well."

36,"@KingCyrusCrypto @HammerZ_NFT Most of the liquid they're getting was already within the nft space, it's a zero-sum game."
37,"@KingBlackBored @HammerZ_NFT I disagree. Mint price is not the only catalyst of an eth suck. Looking to volume is a safer route. 4.6k E vol within 1h 20m is huge and it's sucking up the vol of other projects hence the liq in the space. Also, most of the liquid that WL people got was already within the space."
