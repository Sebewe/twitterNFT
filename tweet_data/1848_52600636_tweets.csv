1,Got some really cool news! The @creatureNFT merch customer service reached out to me saying their systems had been down and apologized for missing my email. I told them I had given away the sweater  and they refunded me for it and the new medium I ordered!
2,@deris_eth @veefriends Love your creature! Not surprised you’re not changing your PFP. Btw what VeeFriend did you pick up?

5,@CarolinaMillan One thing I have experienced quite a bit are people reaching out for insights and input after they already started investing in crypto and NFTs.
6,"@CarolinaMillan Zero! And that’s okay. However, last week I explained crypto and NFTs to half a dozen international colleagues from Asia and EU and got two of them interested in following me. The others just said dont get it but good luck with it."

27,@mindfulruncoach @manmade_brand @GingerBeloved @garyvee I try to be in bed by 10pm but its typically somewhere between that time and 11pm
28,@manmade_brand @mindfulruncoach @GingerBeloved @garyvee It’s just a matter of sticking with it through those initial weeks
29,@manmade_brand @mindfulruncoach @GingerBeloved @garyvee It’s really hard at first but once you build the habit it gets a lot easier
30,@manmade_brand @mindfulruncoach @GingerBeloved @garyvee That’s awesome! It’s a great way to start the day. I do my workouts at 5:30am so I can be finished before my  kids get up.
31,@mindfulruncoach @manmade_brand @GingerBeloved @garyvee Agree that yoga is really good especially for preventing injuries. I may join in some of the live classes if they are at a time that works for me.
32,@melissa_nft @PoisedMeerkat @creatureNFT Love it!
33,@mindfulruncoach @manmade_brand @GingerBeloved @garyvee I’ve been doing running meditation for years so definitely in for that. My other passion is CrossFit which I am easing back into after having had rotator cuff surgery last November. Also like yoga but only do that from time to time.
34,@mindfulruncoach @GingerBeloved @garyvee Definitely will share my feedback. Love to see projects like yours combining web 3 and fitness.
35,@kevincreatures @creatureNFT Haha I used to love that game! Haven’t seen it in ages.

80,@littlelauchie @worldofwomennft Last year started deploying some of the crypto towards NFTs
81,@littlelauchie @worldofwomennft You’re not doing it wrong. If anything you are probably doing it right if you bought in that low and have hit big on least one blue chip like World of Women. I was an early crypto investor that got into BTC in 2014 and into ETH and a few alts in early 2017
82,@littlelauchie @worldofwomennft I think like 3.5 ETH https://t.co/QR8fr1f4ZH
