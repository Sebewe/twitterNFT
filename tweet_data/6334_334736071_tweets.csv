7,"The Bitcoin network sacrifices throughput (i.e. speed) for security &amp; maximum decentralization.

To conclude: in a world of multiple winning blockchains, Bitcoin is likely the best equipped to fulfill the explicit role of our non-sovereign monetary good."
8,"In other words, bitcoin is available to anyone/anywhere/anytime as long as an internet connection is available.

In addition, the Bitcoin network has no geographical boundary. This makes it virtually impossible for nation states to assume control or regulate."
9,"Importantly:
(1) Bitcoin network is decentralized.

No person, corporation, gov’t owns / controls Bitcoin or rules governing network. 

(2) Bitcoin is censorship resistant. 

Because no person, corporation, gov’t owns / controls the network, it is *very* resistant to censorship."
10,"bitcoin is scarce. 

It also has inflation rate of 1.8% (approx. inflation of gold).

*only 21 million bitcoin will exist*

This number is written in source code and CANNOT be changed.

But

bitcoin can be sub-divided into one hundred million (like dollars sub-divided into cents)"
11,"The more characteristics possessed, the better something can serve as being money… OR the more likely it will emerge to be accepted as money.

Illustration provides list of these characteristics and comparison: bitcoin vs. gold vs. traditional government currency (or “fiat”) https://t.co/oWaKSrVuYD"
12,"bitcoin token is commonly referred to as ""digital gold"".

bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a store of value within our increasingly native digital world.

Can it be more?

Economists + historians suggest that “good money” is the result of possessing certain characteristics."
13,"*technically, one can pledge bitcoin as collateral and ""wrap"" it for use on the Ethereum network... but actual bitcoin tokens cannot be removed from the Bitcoin network*"
14,"Bitcoin is secured by computational power via “mining” known as Proof-of-Work (""PoW"").

Miners receive bitcoin the token for devoting computational power to secure the network.

bitcoin tokens are native to Bitcoin network / cannot be removed or transported to another blockchain."
15,"Bitcoin 🧵

Bitcoin is the first ever digital asset AND most recognized.

Bitcoin (capital B) refers to technology + blockchain itself.

bitcoin (small b) refers to digital asset + token.

Bitcoin network is safe, secure, decentralized, permissionless, transparent &amp; open source."
