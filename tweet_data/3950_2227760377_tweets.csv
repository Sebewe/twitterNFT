2,"@petergyang Good point. Some wallets will try to be both, for sure. I mean, the wallets will be indexing users and their feeds, so they’ll be able to get a lot of social features for free."
3,"@petergyang Wallets will become app stores and portals. Highly specialized front ends will be built for specific apps, and they’ll be able to grow seamlessly incorporating related apps. Companies will built around providing portals into the world on chain. https://t.co/3DisgKpyZJ"
4,"@mikedemarais Google only had to index documents when they came up. On the chain you get apps, users, and data. Chain indexers will rule the new world. I’d be shocked if no one inside the company has realized this yet"
5,Can I borrow against staked eth on @Rocket_Pool? That'd be cool
6,"""Proof of mental disorder"" NFTs are gonna be real popular in 5 years with the people who hate NFTs rn"
7,@garybasin are there other jobs out there?
8,@garybasin @TaylorPearsonMe peeps think you're kidding but they don't know that future nft products will come with dedicated digital salesmen. that's how the entire economy will work. super ai representing products will continue to convince new people to buy at increasingly higher prices
9,"""Serious side effects may include [...]"" messages should list stats next to each side effect. Why isn't this normal?

Without stats, should people assume the side effects are rare or common?"
10,"@maghanmcd @voguebusiness Hi, can I send you eth to read the article? I don’t wanna subscribe"
11,“So uh what’s the companies official position on NFTs?” https://t.co/IfygRQ853u
12,@RyanSAdams Tell him to invest in my web3 zoo https://t.co/UyQ6E7U6ZN
13,I think this might actually be a cool idea lol brb gonna research building a zoo
14,"Surprised I haven’t seen a web3 zoo pitch yet. You could sell founder NFTs as a funding mechanism. And all tickets/passes for the zoo could be NFTs that automatically pay a % to the holders of the founder NFTs. 

And obviously: adopt an animal and get a 1/1 pfp NFT lol"
15,"@Grady_Booch Because they generally aren’t capable of being permanent, open, composable, and uncensorable. And they generally don’t produce a verifiably scarce resource that can be used to power and control them."

19,@leveluplambo @nnimrodd @NFTethics @ohhshiny How do you read it? Is the Ohhshiny guy the billionaire in the story? How are they connected? What's the point of the thread?
20,@robinhanson @ourZORA (this would only work/be an interesting experiment if you decided that the owner of the right could submit X topics every Y interval)
21,"@robinhanson @ourZORA If it were an NFT, you could easily build a web portal only accessible by the current owner, where they can send in their selected topics.

If the owner decides they don't want the NFT anymore, and someone else does, they could instantly sell/trade it on any platform"
22,@robinhanson I'm surprised no one has suggested tokenizing the right to pick a blog post topic and auctioning it off using something like @ourZORA
23,"@robinhanson I think I'd be willing to pay .1 ETH for a well-informed post on the potential effects we should expect to see in the world if the majority of asset ownership records were tokenized on a sufficiently-scalable open, public, smart contract platform"
24,@nnimrodd Oh yeah for sure. The “scary” numbers idea is super weird. I have no idea what that’s about
25,@nnimrodd Sounds good in theory. But it's a special kinda hell in practice

30,@cory_eth @ensdomains @chrisbelltoken you’ve done this right?
31,@mikedemarais honestly the fact that they aren't using NFTs in place of wrist bands is bearish
32,"@rob_mose @digi_banc @iamDCinvestor @ensdomains @ethleaderboard I'm sure if anyone bothered to ask him, he would say something like: ""love the sinner, hate the sin."""
33,"If the NYSE tokenized their stonks, would they be fungible or non-fungible? 

Paper stonk certs are non-fungible. But digital stonks feel v fungible."

Totalitarian governments bad. 

Banks bad. 

Vaccine mandates bad."
35,Oh if you say c*sh*pp on here the bots will attacc. Gotit.
36,"I don’t know what it means to “own” a stock. Like, if I buy stonks on robinbood or cash app, what actually happens behind the scenes? I can’t just log into another bank and have them automatically know what stonks I own. Where does my claim to ownership live? https://t.co/sHHEQkkosE"

40,Doing taxes. Down bad.
41,@mikedemarais And these same people don’t think tokens are real lol
42,"@mikedemarais I think they exist on paper. So like, when you trade them on apps like Robinhood, you don’t actually “own” it until some suit sends a fax to someone on wallstreet. And people only agree that you own it because they’re afraid they’ll get sued if they don’t. Because of the paper."

47,@shibboleth88 Then link it or send a quote...
48,"@shibboleth88 Have you ever had a conversation before? It's very unusual to make an outlandish claim, and when asked to prove it, point to 50 articles and say ""go confirm it yourself, I'm not your mom""

Dude, I'm just gonna assume you're making stuff up."
49,"@shibboleth88 Lol I did. I just went through all his articles, and I didn't find anything. Gonna assume you tried to find something and failed too. So I'm just gonna assume you're lying."
50,@shibboleth88 This is what I found. Care to point me in a different direction? https://t.co/MCzQhV21J2

52,@shibboleth88 What basic rights do you think he wants taken away?
53,"@shibboleth88 If you asked brantly whether he believes society/governments should remove the basic rights from the alphabet people, you think he'd say yes?"

56,@thefaketomato @lndian_Bronson @balajis @damedoteth @dystopiabreaker @cobie Really? Looks like he deletes his tweets. I want to know who first dug up the tweet tho
57,@thefaketomato @lndian_Bronson @balajis @damedoteth Who started it? First I tweet saw was from @dystopiabreaker
58,@bitcoin4bernie @lndian_Bronson Do you know who started it this time?
59,@sohrab @lndian_Bronson @balajis If you want to convince balajis to do something you’re probably gonna want to make an actual argument instead of insulting him
60,"@lndian_Bronson This tweet is actually how I found out about the whole situation. Mike linked off to DistopiaBreakers account, which tweeted about brantly 30 minutes earlier https://t.co/1NJ6VadTUY"
61,"@lndian_Bronson Don’t forget that mikedemarais is a delegate too, and holds an incredibly large amount of ENS last I looked. Also, rainbow has plans to integrate ENS into their wallet onboarding. I think they have a pretty big incentive to take control"

64,"@antoniogm @trilljongill13 @lndian_Bronson And there’s nothing anyone can do to prevent him from working on the protocol or in the DAO. 

Also, I highly recommend listening to the Space where brantly defended himself, just to hear how insane the mob was https://t.co/p45zcR0Iq7"
65,"@antoniogm @trilljongill13 @lndian_Bronson The damage done by the mob was limited thankfully. They got him fired, and removed from specific roles in the DAO, but they can’t take his tokens away, or force me to change my delegation to him. AFAIK he’s still the top delegate."

75,@cory_eth Blocklists?
76,"@griffds I've been thinking of @ensdomains as more than just a domain name for a while now. It's a universal profile. So I'm curious how how projects like @LensProtocol will fit into this vision

78,@kylebrussell W3b.eth
79,"@anderssandberg Okay. So irl our ownership of things is dependent on governments and banks. We have paper agreements that are enforced governments and lawyers.

81,"@JoshHochschild The best explanation I have for this is that people are wrapping up their identity with these acts. So if you judge acts as evil, it is the same as calling people evil."
82,"@LensProtocol Curious if anyone from @LensProtocol (@StaniKulechov) can explain if there's a connection between the lens profile NFT and our .eth @ensdomains

92,"The brand image that the mob wants for the DAO is one that contradicts the product. Sure, FWB can be exclusionary; that's kinda their thing. But ENS can't be.

If you want to be certain that you can't be ejected from the protocol, you have to accept that others can't be either."
93,@nnimrodd it's not the full thing sadly https://t.co/hCK3hVLTxr
94,"Anyone can use Ethereum for any reason, even if you don't trust the other people using Ethereum. That's the whole point. That's the brand of the protocol. Should the  DAO have a different brand?"
95,"The argument that brantly will ruin the brand of ENS  forgets the actual brand. ENS is open, trustless, and censorship resistant. Anyone can work on it and use it for any purpose. That's the product. That's the brand. https://t.co/GLlA5OfQwT"

98,@TakeanPhoenix @iamDCinvestor @nicksdjohnson Yes. Agreed.
