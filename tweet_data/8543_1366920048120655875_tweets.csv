14,Confirmed. Tourney races do not count as discovery.
15,Very smooth exchange of breeds with @WhoseForgotten. @zed_run community continues to be one of the best around. LFG!!! 3/3 Filly and a z3 Leg Nak Super coat!! @heyitsthemav
16,@ToolsOfRockNFT Like a Rolling Stone. Is there any other choice? Maybe Althea?
17,@slmnewton @GratefulApe_eth @ipano_ipano @coolcatsnft Delayed for tech issues but imminent release.
18,@knowyourhorses @zed_run Also the tournament qualifying page will do the same. See my recent post about Moonlight Mile.
19,"Poll for the @zed_run community. WWYD with Moonlight?:

A) Let it ride and face CC in the Quarters?
B) Sandbag some marathons to face an easier QF field?

20,@EcsZed @Spotonparts @JayZedRun @knowyourhorses @ZedGazette Asking the other way around. Do tourney races count as discovery?
21,"@Spotonparts @EcsZed @JayZedRun @knowyourhorses @ZedGazette Take it easy Dan, let’s keep it clean here."
22,If I qualify my horse for daily tourney by winning 5 discovery races will the upcoming tourney races count as discovery or will I still need to run 5 more discovery races after the tourney is complete? @JayZedRun @EcsZed @knowyourhorses @ZedGazette @Spotonparts
23,"@GratefulApe_eth @ipano_ipano @coolcatsnft Lots of focus on the token but whats more important is the game. If the game is fun and popular this drives demand for token. Watch game adoption, not token price."
