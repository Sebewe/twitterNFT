14,@mattkalish @DraftKings Always down for another BAYC or Cool Cat contest. A punk or Fidenza would be dope as well.
15,@beaniemaxi @DegenNFTs Lol.
16,@NeonApesYC OG breadsticks with Alfredo sauce is hard to beat.
17,@sm I’d say less of a rebranding and more of a new application to an emerging technology which there will be many more exciting rebrandings coming.
18,"@NizzyNFT @0xWave Yup, this was made for the man on the moon."
19,@Irenezhao_ It will matter less over time as it becomes commonplace. I imagine deeds had a similar level of scrutiny before signing a piece of paper became an acceptable way of transferring assets and assigning ownership.
20,RT @sartoshi_nft: ur nfts crashing &amp; bouncing back in 2022 https://t.co/KcWKqR3sev

25,@ShowdeerArt Oh wow! 🦌 ☁️
26,I’m wondering if Master Sha Artist said their collection name out loud before setting that one up?
27,"Love it! 🤯

Great artist and person that consistently creates great work so will be around for a long time. It would be an amazing collection to showcase on Coinbase. https://t.co/2vxcMRffQO"

34,@thefrenchie_eth @BoredApeYC @adidasoriginals And least favorite brand is now @Apple.
35,@MrMetaMask @BoredApeYC @Apple He got me invested in some kind of fruit company. And so then I got a call from him saying we don't have to worry about money no more.
36,@FncyI Lol!
37,@madrealm_iba @ShowdeerArt Awesome! That’s a great one!
38,@ShowdeerArt @BoredApeYC That's awesome! Everything you need in one place.

45,@DanTwin @zksync very cool. let me know what you think.
46,"@_miketriumph_ @boredapebot The party receiving the VF made out pretty good on this one. VF floor for that rarity is 12e, but also a dope mutant so in the realm of fair."
47,@GoodGuy_NFT @coolcatsnft If you’re looking long term… VeeFriends is the clear answer and safest bet to be around in five years.
48,@ilham_nft Happy to have this wonderful piece! Thank you!! 🙏
49,@subtle_bubble That might be me! Happy to have at least one in my tez wallet for now. I’ve been on a objkt bender the last few days and glad to hear you like my collection.! :)

57,@Irenezhao_ pretty much spot on. pay attention to earn.
58,@VickijEth @BoredApeYC I love it! looks great!! :)
59,"@TeamGaryVee @garyvee @veefriends For me, it would be the Holo Spiffy Salmon.  The drawing and background go together so well, and even  makes it look the the salmon is underwater. The perfect VF."
60,The bidding has started... who wants to take it from me? :) https://t.co/CkDav54M8K
61,@adamfwoods Da fak is in there? David Blaine?
62,"@ipano_ipano The answer is orange, but ngl aquamarine is a close second."
63,"@ohDotss @garyvee I’d be curious to hear his thoughts on cryptocurrencies as a threat to the current political structure (currency and governance), and what he might anticipate as a competitive response (if any) from political states over the next several years."
64,"what happens in a month when the staking supply of $WOOL runs out, and then circulating supply doubles  with no real demand or utility? It seems like the game just ends with no real winner except those that cash in over the next few weeks."
65,@claire_salvo maybe i should just put my vans order in now.
66,@Corso52 Enjoy! CodeWars is a website that has fun exercises for all levels that are good for practice.

81,"@reylarsdam @SuperRare whoa, incredible!"
82,@jimmyfallon @BoredApeYC Welcome to the club!
83,@pragmaticscgop @NicoleArbour mainstream isn’t always right doesn’t equal mainstream is always wrong. Also interested to see numbers behind infections… have a feeling it’s more rural areas (which lean GOP) catching up to cities and otherwise  unrelated to party lines.
84,"@ZachWinterton My question for the musician would be “why wouldn’t you want complete freedom over your artistic choices and distribution plus the monetary upside?” I feel like artists have felt the need to chose freedom or money in the past, and a mental shift is needed that they can have both."
85,"@beeple Congrats, astonishing work and achievement!"
86,@ABigThingBadly @GutterCatGang Nothing but love for the GCG here! Hope to join more species soon (just a GD so far).
87,@johnkonrad @man_integrated @SecretaryPete Hmmm… what goes faster 400hp car or boat? Can a boat deliver above sea level?

95,@NathanCRoth There’s something about being slightly asymmetric that makes me uneasy. Or may just be the gradient.
96,@long You know it’s good when they don’t even give a fuck if it’s close to a circle or not.
