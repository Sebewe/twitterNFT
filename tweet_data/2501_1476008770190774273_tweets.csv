60,Capitalizing on asymmetrical risk-reward opps and being able to stomach the swings is key for wealth development. The ability to take risk is a super power that dwindles as we get older. 1 right JPEG could mean you never work again. If that’s not asymmetrical I’m not sure what is
61,@crispylines 💯 asymmetrical risk-reward payoff is key
