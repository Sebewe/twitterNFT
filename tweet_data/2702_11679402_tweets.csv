13,"10/ Oops, forgot to mention that I am buzzed for the launch of the apartment builder for @Worldwide_WEB3. I'm a huge fan of these shared metaverse experiences where you have a chance to show off some creativity. Looking forward to buidling!"
14,"9/ I hope some of you will be able to share in these awesome things coming up, or this thread has prompted you to take a closer look at these projects. Have a great week! I know I will."
15,"8/ The Proof collective has also scheduled an announcement for this Thursday/Friday for the next big project(s?) to drop for the community, entitled ""Future Proof"" we cannot wait to learn of the additional value the team plans on delivering."
16,"7/ If you haven't yet heard of the @proof_xyz collective you soon will. The Grails drop mint period is coming to a close and the tantalising reveal event is scheduled for the weekend. For details on this drop check out the great thread from @ArbVision 
https://t.co/YazCAkwsBr"
17,6/ I get the sense that @lukeabc and team have been quietly building away and that this coming week will be the start of many exciting developments in the Thingdoms universe to come.
18,5/ THINGDROP 002. I'm a massive fan of the @thingdoms and am super excited to see what comes of Thingdrop 002 and what follows. The team has now gone fulltime on the project since establishing not only a sound studio but a workspace in preparation for building out the team.
19,"4/ Allowlist had multiple options that both rewarded followers of Josie's works and community as well as accessible raffles for all, distribution looks to be wide-spread and fair. Very excited to see the amazing looking designs over the coming days."
20,3/ The lore that has been crafted to support the awesome looking designs which are all encoded on-chain is top-tier and the project has a perfect home in the metaverse-y narrative that we sit in rn.
21,"2/ It's hard to say which is most exciting, but I think that the @CyberBrokers_ mint might take the cake. A hugely ambitious project from an extremely talented team with crypto art OG @josiebellini at the helm."
22,"So many exciting things happening this week in the world of NFT's! I think this deserves a 🧵. Huge events for @thingdoms, @CyberBrokers_, @proof_xyz and @Worldwide_WEB3."
