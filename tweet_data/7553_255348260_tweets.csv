50,@MrTravisTho What’s that?
51,@jayprasuhn You and I need to chat. @simonwhitfield and I talked about you yesterday and we need your bright mind to fill in some gaps.
52,"My ‘oversimplified’ take on what’s important if you want to grow authentically in the NFT space for the long term. 
1. Community (don’t make people beg)
2. Utility (offer and continue to create value) 
3. Art (make it pretty) 
4. Cultural relevance (sentimental attachment helps)"
53,@AlexStemplewski ‘Community’ is the greatest asset you can have. Nothing else matters in the first instance.

75,"@sean_specie This is a great question. And everyone’s personal thoughts on this can potentially impact the success of a project, from what I’ve seen. 
Investor = aligned with the vision and active in the success. 
Customer = expecting something for your money and passive in the success. 🤔🤔"
