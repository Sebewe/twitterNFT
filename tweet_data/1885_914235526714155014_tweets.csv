📰 Trending News
📰 Latest News
📰 Project’s I Own News

I’m looking at you @LuckyTraderHQ. Let’s start blurbin’"
1,"@gjohnsx @Cryptoon_Goonz Makes sense for being ultra safe. This is my approach (I'm not a much of a trader):

Hardware:
- 95% of my nfts
- buy &amp; sell (tho not often)
- mint presales

Hot:
- gas wars
- mobile required activity
- sites that don't support ledger"
2,@aaditsh guide
3,"Work with people who teach you something new every day. 

I definitely right click saved @drewsifsoup’s brain while we were in LA. https://t.co/GgOziiKeAc"
4,"@KindaHibrawi @opensea 🔥🔥

It was wonderful meeting you at Supermint! Hopefully we can get that impersonator taken down 😠"
5,"Launching an NFT project is a serious amount of work. 

It’s the beginning of a startup business with crowd funding. You can never turn it off. 

And the hardest work has yet to come."
6,"Two communities and companies i’ve been building over the last 6 months. 

Time to supercharge them! https://t.co/Bu8OmYBbYP"
7,@SamFeds The power of independent thinking is immense.
8,@MacNCheeasy @Cryptoon_Goonz It was written in the code.
9,@ishverduzco So good man! Love building with you 🏗
10,Met so many wonderful people at @supermintnft !! https://t.co/g62rAhD5J1
11,@mattgee Great meeting you yesterday!
12,gm to everyone i met yesterday IRL. Ya’ll are amazing and give me so much energy.
13,gm to LA goons. see you at @supermintnft today.
14,@JM24_X @0xInuarashi https://t.co/l2vmTZlS3w
15,"@0xInuarashi check out @LuckyTraderHQ ‘s chrome extension. It has a bunch of these kinds of tools. 

https://t.co/tNfJKPZNQO"
16,"3 things carry a brand started by NFTs. 

1️⃣ The artist
2️⃣ The community
3️⃣ The founding team

Don’t skimp on any of these."
17,gm to creators who click publish every day. shit ain’t easy.
18,"@Cryptoassetadd1 @theincubator_ So f*cking true. 

We’ll never onboard millions of people into crypto like that."
19,@0xInuarashi npm uninstall hardhat-gas-reporter
20,Next we need a gas report diff tool. Open up a gas optimization pull request and easily show what you’ve improved!
21,"Ethereum is a gas guzzler. 

That’s why the @HardhatHQ gas reporter plug-in is so handy. 

It provides a min/max/avg gas usage report when you run tests on your code. https://t.co/rxXXhzDqUY"
22,"@SamFeds Love that thought.  

Desired actions + incentives = 🚀🚀

I wonder how a DAO or company could succeed doing this. 

@MichaelHofeld @RyanHodge have you seen anyone exploring these areas?"
23,"@NFTnudy 100%. The truth is a smart contact can’t drain your wallet by itself.

You must give it permission to access and transfer your NFTs. 

You would see something like this in metamask 👇👇. Stop if you don’t trust the site. https://t.co/wBU1cSvjD3"
24,gm to builders who experiment and fail often
25,"@stapeskidotcom @SeanTat2s You only need an app if you want to do instant reveal. 

Otherwise you can just use @pinatacloud + @IPFS and execute a transaction to your smart contract to swap from unreveiled metadata to revealed."
26,@stapeskidotcom @SeanTat2s Here’s a simplistic description of how a delayed reveal works. https://t.co/QNK4f7op29
27,"@supermintnft @Cryptoon_Goonz @drewsifsoup Some great conversations today.

NFTs flip the model. The artists hire the business people now 😏"
28,"@NFTzMe @cryptonia_d69 Smart contracts actually aren’t as risky as some make them out to be. 

They aren’t allowed to “drain your wallet” unless you grant them permission in a separate transaction. 

It’s a big misconception out there."
29,@FrothingDocker Ugh so sorry to hear that. my DMs are always open!
30,"Share me the etherscan contract links to the NFTs you’re minting. 

I’ll review their code for you!"
31,@stapeskidotcom Hey hey. I joined after it went live. @SeanTat2s carried that all by himself before that!
32,gm to everyone who wants to learn the web3 tech stack
33,@mcardle_pd Definitely. definitely a future Gooniversity class
34,@Naitureboy Haha i know that life all too well
35,"NFTs allow the digital world to more closely mimic the real world. 

You own a desk you don’t use anymore? You list it for sale on facebook marketplace. 

This has never existed for digital items until now."
36,@FonzGm @RyanHodge @tokenproof I’ll reach out next week!
37,"@Coco_Crackdown @Cryptoon_Goonz A recording will be available to listen to afterwards!

Future sessions will be hosted at other times to accommodate various timezones."
38,"@abstracttoys Ideally all projects would do “provably fair” NFT mints.

But sometimes things get messy or the founders don’t know how to.

In this case, and Azuki’s as well… it’s possible the team was still making final fixes &amp; improvements on the art after the minting had started."
39,"@willac_eth @iamrobotbear @Cryptoon_Goonz Not just newbies!

I think everyone is going to learn something :)."
40,@WYNDML We’ll for sure cover some high levels in Gooniversity!
41,"@Naitureboy Congrats! did you try using the testnet first?

Gas is free over there!"
42,gm to everyone who’s curious to understand an NFT contract’s code.
43,"Memberships are traditionally a sunken cost. 

This creates endless “Should I buy it?” decision fatigue. 

NFTs remove this obstacle. Just sell it if it’s not for you."
44,"Managing your Discord notifications is key to keeping your sanity. 

Should I write a thread on the secret tricks to navigating discord? https://t.co/ook36M7UBw"
45,@CryptoShaunda 😆
46,"gm to everyone drowning in discord notifications.

there has to be a better way right?"
47,"This is why newsletter and podcast platforms are so great. 

You can take your subscribers and head elsewhere!"
48,"Decentralization creates choice. 

But that doesn’t mean everyone needs to bank themselves. 

Having the option to exit a centralized platform is what’s essential."
49,@mcardle_pd @Ledger Block out a couple hours on tuesday night!
50,"@GooninAround @iDebo23 @Ledger Selling requires you give Open Sea full access to transferring your NFT(s). 

I’ll be giving a talk on wallet security in the @Cryptoon_Goonz discord on Tuesday @ 10PM EST. 

It will be Goon Gang exclusive where folks can ask any of their questions."
51,"@GooninAround @iDebo23 @Ledger Collab land only does a *read* from your wallet. This is safe. 

I mint, buy/sell, and do everything with my NFTs from a single wallet on my Ledger. 

If you want to be extra safe, store your NFTs in a Ledger wallet u *never* use for selling."
52,"gm to everyone who’s ready to setup their @ledger today. 

reply below if you need help! 👇👇"
53,"Great summary of what the hell happened tonight from the CEO of Open Sea. 

tl;dr - Open Sea wasn’t exploited. https://t.co/HWrGfc2NKl"
54,"Revoke access to Open Sea for any NFTs you've ever listed before to be safe.

https://t.co/IrfBdFstqC
https://t.co/cxPv9OTuBO https://t.co/0YlIkZjlHz"
55,"NFT smart contracts at their core are very simple. 

They keep track of which ethereum address owns which token id. That’s pretty much it."
56,"@VibhorChandel Great story! I was part of another little known merger Bob pulled off. 

He acquired the tech arm behind:

• https://t.co/QP3xQsTfVJ
• HBO Now
• Playstation Vue
• WWE Network
• And so many more

We were streaming video specialists and built @disneyplus from the ground up."
57,"gm to everyone listening to music to start their saturday morning

https://t.co/teop5kPJg8"
58,"@thatsGxci 1) strong commitments via unchangeable code

• promotes an open internet where you can build on top of other protocols
• enables digital scarcity

2) true digital ownership

• ability to sell your digital items
• websites ask for permission to see your items"
59,"The best products do a few things very well. 

The mediocre ones are like a diner menu."
60,"@w3marketer A lot of new people entering the space. 

Many whom try to operate the new way but can’t shake their roots."
61,"@theincubator_ Oglivy on Advertising

Trying to up my marketing game."

63,"""Click here to reveal secret words.""

This is the moment when your Metamask becomes a security liability. Your recovery phrase should never touch a computer. 

So sleep well at night and buy a @Ledger. https://t.co/IujIEYFets"
64,"@ElDonPrimo @pattycfor3 @NFTethics @WeatheReportNFT @Dentinmyhead You can create custom nicknames for each server that allows it.

Would be very good to confirm that username's id # matches your screenshot."
65,"@iamrobotbear It's uncomfortable to learn something new. It will often make you feel like an imposter.

That means you're on the right track."
66,@crypto_pisano @opensea roast 'em
67,@drewsifsoup Threads usually take me 2-3 hours to write. It’s no joke.
68,@DangyWing Love you too! Tweet those amazing thoughts of yours so I can start liking them 😄
69,"Start an art driven NFT project

But only offer your lead artist 5% ownership 😕.

WTF. Don't penny pinch on talented people. Especially artists."
70,@NFTsleepy I appreciate that!
71,"@broFBtalk @Cryptoon_Goonz Thanks man!

@SeanTat2s sets the tone for everything we do. We're so blessed to have him as our leader."
72,@wenweb4 Thanks! Love having you in the goon gang
73,"@Sneakybizz Thanks sneaky. I miss hanging and diving deep with ya'll also.

What topics did you enjoy the most? 

I need to get my ass in gear on writing threads 😄"
74,"I just reached 3k followers 😮 .

I never thought this was possible when I started taking twitter seriously in March 2021.

I couldn't have done it without each and everyone of you 🙏 ."
75,@thisiskp_ @VritiSaraf @Cryptoon_Goonz I owe ya one for the incredibly insightful Q&amp;A you gave in Makers Mark 😄

But I was actually intending this to be from the consumer perspective!"
