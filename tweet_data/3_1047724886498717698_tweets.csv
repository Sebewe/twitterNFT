put Kevin in charge https://t.co/4McQ56GQDC"
5,@Helloimmorgan oh
6,@Helloimmorgan now you jinxed it
7,@dketox8 thank you ❤
8,"bet on people, not on hype"
9,"@RoyPrice @Pixelmon all you have to do is come up with a couple fake teasers. hire a contractor off Fiverr or buy some current utility bundles. rip off videos of other in development games. build hype for 6 months, boom there you go"
10,"side note: I'm not personally invested, I'm just utterly sick of of the daily cash grabs and this takes the cake. there is no art. there is no team. its one guy, hiring the cheapest possible contractors to extort 70 million on promises. he's a Minecraft streamer, not a builder"
11,"we should sue the hell out of @Pixelmon and make an example of them. show bad actors that they can't come into our world and use smoke and mirrors, cash grab 70 million and walk away scot free. everytime another walks away with no consequences, another one lines up."
12,"@boofyBurner it was weeks behind. I still feel there is multiple roadmap points that need to be launched before hand, unless they launch it all at the same time, which wouldn't feel right. just speculation on my end"
13,@iLikeDiscourse @thedigitalvee @Pixelmon @LegendsOfVenari thank you!
14,@nftsphantoms calling it now. cash grab
15,@thedigitalvee @Pixelmon @LegendsOfVenari I'll have to take a look!
16,@Nate_Rivers @thedigitalvee I'll see you at the floor 🤝
17,"@Nate_Rivers @thedigitalvee this is fair. BUT you can buy the MAYC dip again, flip those again in Q2 and be liquid for the release"
18,"@Nate_Rivers @thedigitalvee Nate you were loading up mutants back at 4-5 eth, you're sitting pretty. just a perfect opportunity to double dip"
19,@punk3178 can they get the duct tape off to even drink it? too soon?
20,@thedigitalvee @Nate_Rivers and people like me look forward to that day
21,@Booblino91 @Pixelmon I held out as long as I could. but it is the end https://t.co/l05aa5TOV2
22,"I am not spreading mis-information here, and I still need to verify, but if this is true, the pitchforks are coming out. absolutely zero justification for saying anything like this, especially after your clear incompetence to even have pixel art render correctly @Pixelmon https://t.co/amxZYWfUbj"
23,@Nate_Rivers I'm very confident it gets delayed. I've been saving a bag for that very occasion
24,@FncyI this is definitely priced in
25,"popular opinion: $APE is not priced into BAYC yet 

unpopular opinion: $APE will not be releasing in Q1, they need more roadmap achievements to roll out first and Mutants vs Apes set that schedule behind several weeks. BAYC isn't going to release a token with zero use case"
26,@finalnftart yep!1
27,"@finalnftart do you like the person's content and takes? if no, then unfollow. following someone isn't a form of friendship and unfollowing isn'tending a friendship. Twitter is meant to be a information pipeline. at least for me"
28,show some basic respect and humanity for others. we are extremely blessed that we sit around buying jpegs for the majority of our days. that holds ZERO weight when compared to the lives of other human beings.
29,"it's not cool to make jokes about a country being invaded. even if you think saying ""putin buy my bags"" funny, it's really not and you should probably keep it to yourself. lives and families are on the line."
30,@fvckrender @wellconnctd is a solid dude and has my recommendation
31,"@machiavillain_1 haha not at all, but similar vibes"
32,I will need nothing good to mint tomorrow because I will be playing Elden Ring all day. thank you in advance
33,"@MiekkiMofumofu @DentedFeelsNFT I think its fairly obvious they aren't. if they are, I don't see the benefits"
34,@MiekkiMofumofu @DentedFeelsNFT well it says given away randomly. so I'm assuming thays how most whitelists were given
35,@MiekkiMofumofu @DentedFeelsNFT 0.11 is pretty fair compared to what other projects are charging. and I'm not a fan of whitelists but this one definitely didn't seem as crazy and rigorous and dragged out as most
36,yooo this is sick. looking forward to supporting @DentedFeelsNFT tomorrow. glad to see the original artist of this work getting the credit he deserves https://t.co/frEqnE84td

40,"imagine a world where projects finish the product first, or at least an alpha version, then do a public sale after"
41,@RyanSmi51557286 @Treasure_DAO think the cheapest is about 2-3 ETH from what I've seen
42,look what all the joking about getting robbed while wearing a BAYC hoodie got us now
43,@pistol7113 @Nate_Rivers @Treasure_DAO up to your own preference!
44,"I am now smol

time to go balls deep in the $MAGIC eco-system

@Treasure_DAO is building something crazy, and long term I see a ton of potential"
45,@ShortsHoward you're one of the few who wouldn't take advantage of it either
46,@Liltamale2 it will
47,"calling it now. the new/next trend is going to be CC0 projects. reasonable mint prices, at least compared to what we've seen lately so it sells out easy, and no obligations for the team to do anything after."
48,"the Orbs Dutch auction is starting again. with a 0.95 price point, and secondary royalties at 8.88%. 

 you've clearly exposed yourselves as greedy and that can't be undone. please just save some face, shut it down, and try to find a way to provide value to your holders."
49,"coming at you live from the Web3 Hub with your weekly weather report. Weather Report is reported to be ran by con artists, taking advantage of an artist and offering 5% in equity in exchange.

50,there's a big difference between mob mentality and public outrage. mob mentality is senseless hostility. public outrage is rightful anger for a legitimate reason.
51,@ape3593 I agree with this
52,"@beaniemaxi this has to be one of the most bullshit filled, deflecting responses I seen in a while. address the allegations towards you, instead of pointing at projects where your main contribution was influence. making other people money doesn't make you a good person."
53,"in the sake of transparency, I would have bought the Orbs at a 0.00888 price point. they just didn't let it get there unfortunately"
54,"there better be compensation for the 600 or so holders. no hate on BT here but if you think you can partner with two of the greediest companies/individuals, and expect to come out unscathed, you should have done more research. refund the poor users that bought and burned."
55,so the 888/Gala/BT drop has been cancelled now because they weren't happy with how low the price was dropping. I thought that the market decided what they were worth? what's going to happen to the users that burned for Orbs or bought at a higher price point?
56,something to keep in mind when that new project you just heard about already has over 200k followers on Twitter. it's not hard to get this formula down after you've already pumped put 5-10 projects https://t.co/UKrEiDqMpa
57,@IC_mints I was more so responding to the people that said my tweet hadn't aged well. I wasn't putting anyone down and I totally could be proven wrong. my maint point was just that a two day pump doesn't change the entire vision.
58,@0xBender tactical pricing
59,"@PerplexingPeg12 thank you, I appreciate that 🤝"
60,"wishing ill will on them or anyone who buys the project. just throwing out words of caution in a space that usually moves too fast to heed them. I make the best choice with the hand I am dealt at that time, hiw the rest of the cards play out is out of my control."
61,"but that doesn't mean the fundamentals are there. and if I am proven wrong, then good, hopefully the make good use of the 10 mill they raised, and I hope every investor makes a bag off of it. I just call out projects and people that seem greedy or sketchy. that doesn't mean I'm"
62,"getting a bunch of replies on a old tweet of mine from two months ago about Psychedelics Anonymous. I'm not fudding your project but a little fomo and one whale being the majority of your price movement in the past 48 hours does not mean I'm wrong. everything gets a pump

🧵"
63,@ape3593 0.00888 sounds like a good price to me
64,@stevefink 10 out of 10 tweet
65,@Gangelakis I also have nothing against BT. I think he just signed up to play with the wrong people and probably liked the ides of making a few million off of one piece
66,"@Gangelakis when Gala and BT were speaking inside the space, it's very clear thay all 3 parties are heavily involved. it's al obviously just BT's art. he doesn't have much involvement outside of that. he wouldn't be able to demand a price point like that without 888 or Gala"
67,so $looks price goes down and everyone comes out with pitchforks?
68,@Gangelakis this is just backpedaling after the outrage. he wasn't saying thay in the Twitter space
69,@Gangelakis all three are involved mate
70,I SEE THOSE NOUN GLASSES @budlight
71,"@Nate_Rivers how did you justify your price point? 

""art blocks"""
72,"@LitForNothing I never once told anyone to buy from less fortunate artists. I saw speaking on using a reputation such as that, to extract ETH from others."
73,"@LitForNothing when was the last time I attempted to rake in 21k ETH in the name of ""charity"""
74,@ElijahLeeReeder thank you ❤

76,"@ape3593 I called it last night. seen it time and time again 

https://t.co/ppiSKYT5iR"
77,"and there it is. it will start at 11 ETH but they remove the 8.88 ETH floor, as well as standing by the partners BT and Gala games. bravo 888, you're following the scummy footsteps of those before you quite well. for the love of everything NFT related, do not buy this https://t.co/mA1q0UXFNC"
78,"@NathanCRoth @punk4156 @punk6529 @DeezeFi @Loopifyyy @GiancarloChaux @0x_fxnction Loopify did monetize Treeverse, but it was fairly priced, not a cash grab and had a long term vision."
79,@squiggles did you spend that 2.5k ETH already?
80,"here is the deflecting, putting responsibility on Gala and BT. hiding comments in the name of mental health, discussions about ""letting the market decide price"". same as always. have to save face to cash in later again down the road. how about you share what you'll make off this? https://t.co/nKxb72K01K"

82,"RT @iamDCinvestor: i probably sound like a broken record, but relatively long-standing participants trying to cash in on accrued clout for…"
83,"I guarantee you, 888 hits us with some bs about his feelings being hurt, and some justification on why he believed his circles were worth 8.88 ETH. then he'll drop mint price to 0.888 ETH but make supply 8,888 or whatever, and I better not see you guys falling for it"
84,@Nate_Rivers https://t.co/5ACpIXjNLQ
85,"@NathanHeadPhoto there is plenty we can do about it. we call it how we see it, and inform others that don't know better. the rest is natural. but if we make it a habit and a code we ""OG's"" live by then eventually it will become the new normal and bad actors will know it won't fly anymore"
86,@Ogcsn @wholisticguy @SimarItDown well said
87,@furiosity__ he could drop it to 0.888 ETH and I still don't think you'll see a positive ROI
88,"@ShortsHoward @888tnw well whoever ends up buying this, even though I'm sure he will drop the price, will have both of those things on their dinner table about 24 hours after"
89,@ShortsHoward @888tnw Warren and Charlie would never do something like this
90,"@ShortsHoward but sir don't you hold Berkshire, you couldn't possibly be endorsing this behavior. 😂"
91,@theYRDGZ @abysms11 I completely agree with both of you. we need more people calling this out. some flips aren't worth destroying our entire space
92,@SimarItDown never a good sign
93,@machiavillain_1 no I didn't. is it worth my time? 😅
94,"I really am not one for trying to drag anyone's name through the mud, but this community is getting their pockets emptied over and over again by idolized influencers and artificially hyped projects. put aside your lust for quick gains for just a second and think"
95,"he clearly joined this space with tons of money, grew a following because of it, and is now planning on extracting even more ETH for the 2nd or 3rd time? don't fall for this garbage, we have to be smarter than this"
96,"I doubt many people remember, but 888 joined the scene the same time I did last year. he grew a following because he spent a lot of ETH and bought everything with 888 on it. being a whale does not mean you provide value and buying a few artists work doesn't make you a good person"
97,"if anyone buys this absolute cash grab of a project from 888 tomorrow, you deserve to get wrecked. extracting 21k ETH in the name of ""exclusivity, inclusivity and helping less fortunate artists"" is utterly laughable. don't give your ETH to King Richard pretending to be Robin Hood https://t.co/CmsnIJuvKb"
98,@_DuckLord @squiggles I'm not even sure what you're saying
99,RT @FriendlyJameson: there’s an important difference between “web3 is the future” and “burn every centralized  institution to the ground”
