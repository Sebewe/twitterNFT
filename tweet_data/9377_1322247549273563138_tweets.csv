54,@divine_economy @cryptohun3y just talking out loud here thanks for entertaining the convo
55,@divine_economy @cryptohun3y rich people can store wealth in individual pieces of culture but im hung up on the idea of someone being able to “own” an idea that makes it unsharable or loses its resonance. i dont think storing millions in culture stops people from creating it or generating value around it.
56,"@divine_economy yes to music NFTs but visual art is ~*not*~ for the rich. fine art, sure maybe. maybe i'm not seeing clearly but i have seen very little successful fine art in NFTs.  pop art, cartoons, &amp; wild style will always belong to the streets."
