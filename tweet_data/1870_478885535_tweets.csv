DROPPING TOMORROW at 11am EST / 5pm CET on  https://t.co/0gUOZvnIRP

DISCORD: https://t.co/X44jIciGo1"
50,"20/ That’s why we will be open sourcing everything we’ve done, so that many can come and copy our model, make it theirs, learn from our mistakes, and use the power of web3 to create their wonderful art."
51,"19/ But the most important aspect of all of this, for us, is to create a model so that hundreds of talented and passionate filmmakers are able to make the films they dream of, thanks to the power and community and web3.

So they can greenlight themselves like @jimmycthatsme says https://t.co/oZ3lf2ru8g"
52,18/ And we've had cool appearances on big Press outlets. https://t.co/iRYQL8x8Mo
53,"17/ We’ve also done some cool collabs for CryptoPunks and Bored Apes:

These are 15 unique NFTs created by 15 amazing artists inspired by and in support of “Calladita”:"
60,"10/ We have an AMAZING TEAM in this project, including Emily Mortimer, Antonio de la Torre, and @jimmycthatsme, without whom none of this would be possible:

Meet our A-list cast and incredible crew here:  https://t.co/wJSGekaPiY"
61,"9/ Our ROADMAP, you ask?

62,"10/ Doesn't this 👆🏻 look perfect for one of the admired whales that have followed been following our project? 

👀 @CozomoMedici @punk6529"
63,"9/ Additionally, the top backer of the collection will receive a very special gift, my Genesis NFT, a 4-min short film created especially for this. 

‘Ana on an August Day’ is a poetic, atmospheric film about the protagonist of “Calladita”, and her world: https://t.co/wavTDpaZlz"
64,8/ All the NFTs will also allow you to participate in the success of the film via a DAO which will allow holders to vote on what is done with 50% of the revenues that come from the film
65,"7/ There are also some additional, very cool web3 native perks, like putting your Avatar/PFP in the credits of the film, or displaying an NFT from your collection in the film, via a Digital Frame. https://t.co/dbazYvSmje"
66,"6/ You can see some of the amazing art we've got here. 

We've put a lot of care into creating a great collection of unique NFTs, so you will feel proud to own one of these precious tokens.

https://t.co/oAIJJ1b66B"
67,"5/ The NFTs will be structured in 4 Tiers, with different prices Perks for each tier (including appearing in the credits, props, or coming on set).

Tier 1 =   0.18 ETH
Tier 2 =   0.6 ETH
Tier 3 =   3 ETH
Tier 4 =   6 ETH https://t.co/CnKzmWCiIO"
68,"4/ Tomorrow we are dropping a collection of 2,400 NFTs created from the original short film and other materials, with 100% of the $ going towards the budget of the film.

We are taking nothing from this, but putting it all up on the screen, in order to make this story justice."
69,"3/ And we want it to be one of the first films ever to be financed via NFTs. Also the first European, and the first Spanish-language film to follow this model.

The web 3.0 ethos of decentralization takes on the most centralized and corporation-controlled art form. https://t.co/uGMSoJeXMM"
70,"2/ The film tells the story of a young Colombian woman who works as a live-in maid in the summer mansion of a rich Spanish family, and focuses on the social, racial and class tensions that arise within this environment. 

It's a story of female empowerment and liberation. https://t.co/icMEzmZcBy"
71,"1/  CALLADITA  is a project that I've been working on for over 3 years, since before I made the original short film on which this feature is based. 

That short has been selected at many top festivals worldwide and acquired by HBO in the U.S.

Watch it on https://t.co/chCtNTG3kL"
