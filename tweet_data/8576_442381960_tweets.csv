9,"@DeFi_Brian @raidparty again reveal was never delayed this is also a new company to the space, we got companies who have been in the space and still delay weeks at a time rather than a few hours like raid, nothing in this space is perfect atleast they are working around the clock to fix mistakes"
10,"@DeFi_Brian @raidparty They also gave away a ton of free NFTs because of these hiccups and are constantly working to fix their mistakes, theres projects with 0 communication and 0 work ethic behind them, atleast with raid party we see a consistent grind of work and effort"
11,"@DeFi_Brian @raidparty 99.9% of projects run into issues and delays and tbh even though this was delayed it was one of the smoothest and easiest drops to manage when it actually did launch, especially on the auction side with genesis. They tried to make it unique and had a few hiccups which is fine"
