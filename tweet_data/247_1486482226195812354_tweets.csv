1,@___tots___ @pranksy @dutchtide Theoretically you need the convenience store architecture + 711 decoration + MB interior... I think that's the modern architecture?
2,"Small victory: Just traded for another (lesser known) grail #MidnightBreeze, one of only three full Convenience Store sets. Considering the other two are owned by @pranksy and @dutchtide himself, I feel like I'm in good company😁 https://t.co/0NQzai5gO6"
3,"@bobaepicure @AzukiZen What a great deal too, congrats and welcome!"
4,@IcedcoffeeEth But sir that’s an everose root beer… I have a soft spot for a little rose gold :)

6,"RT @0x_Beans: If you guys are actually going to meme Kevin to a 50 eth floor, Ill write a wrapped collection with 0% royalties so at least…"
7,"New #MidnightBreeze banner edit. For the culture.

Thanks @zzbr33zy @lenowa2009 🤣

8,@DrBitcoinNP @doodles not yet! but have my eye on a few specific ones...
9,@JackSitt @doodles haha sometimes i don't even recognize myself... it'll be back soon :)
10,"Utility and wrapping questions aside, the art and animation on space @doodles is fantastic. Very impressed."
11,"@plowieeth @ZAGABOND @doodles Complementary assets shouldn’t be dilutionary; if they released “baby doodles” then sure, but spaceships seem completely non-interchangeable with the genesis. 

Not that all drops need to be a $ maker, but I could see product benefits had they kept it independent too."
12,@ZAGABOND @doodles Ugh this is admittedly a new concept for most that are used to standalone airdrops or claims. I still don’t understand why they chose to go with this model instead of an independent NFT?
13,@sunalNFT @BoredApeYC @RTFKTstudios @coolcatsnft @BYOPills I’m sure they’ll keep adding more value; problem now is that buying the complete set costs a lot…
14,@JackSitt Nothings worse than the hype crypto influencers
15,"What other projects have delivered massive returns to long term holders based on airdrop value alone? @BoredApeYC by far, followed by @RTFKTstudios, @coolcatsnft, @BYOPills? Any other good ones I’m missing?"
16,@riceboy42069 @AzukiZen …a water hair
17,"@itsorawan @BoredApeYC @doodles @RTFKTstudios @AzukiZen @worldofwomennft One can debate the order, but this is an undeniable list."
18,@riceboy42069 @AzukiZen My golden bean and golden ticket are quite curious as well 🤔 https://t.co/uqFyi8eyCD
19,"Can the @federalreserve please keep pumping the markets until @Coinbase_NFT and maybe IG/FB NFT integrations are live?

kthxbye 😆"
20,@riceboy42069 @AzukiZen Oof those are all good ones. But that golden bean…
21,"@Baozard Super clean, and nice greenhouse!"
22,Why do I want to keep buying absurdly expensive assets with no real world utility that will be extremely hard to sell?
23,"In case it wasn’t clear, Ukrainians are clearly some bad ass mother f*ckers. Unshakeable willpower and resolve."
24,"…help keep up the relevance, but ultimately it will be on the core team to keep a steady cadence of quality releases.

As an industry, we should aspire to break this cycle and achieve steady volume, but this will only happen as we expand beyond early adopters."
25,"@comfydevil states this so cleanly. Good projects have huge fomo waves followed by nerve wracking quiet. For projects to survive in our nascent industry, they’ll need to remain relevant for long enough that they can trigger another wave for the next release. 

Communities can… https://t.co/XG6e4KVbeC"
26,"@SNKRS33 I click through many Breezes and consider bidding, but then I see @SNKRS33 as the owner :(. You have a fantastic collection."
27,"@IcedcoffeeEth Fire on Fox Fire, love it"
28,@latteicecoffee I’m excited to see what you got
29,And throwing up a new #MidnightBreeze banner as well :)
30,"Ok slow day, so might as well rotate with a #NewProfilePic. And who doesn’t like a giant gold sword 😄 https://t.co/DQGEkDOftd"
31,"@konger_eth @AzukiZen Because why not, only 3x elemental type https://t.co/Z77ScI8NaD"
32,"@InsightRh Yeah this post wasn’t aimed at IF, they’ve actually looked very clean. This is more talking about hyped releases like Pixelmon, Hape, Oxya, C-01 etc"
33,"@InsightRh If the reveal (arguably the most important release) is sloppy, how can we have faith in the team’s rigor, QA, development capabilities, and accountability for any subsequent releases?"
34,"@InsightRh That isn’t to say that my own ideas are best, but it simply isn’t something I’d feel comfortable “just trusting”. Furthermore, the reveal tells us a lot. It’s the first release on a roadmap, so it gives us our first datapoint on the team and their ability to execute…"
35,"@InsightRh Sorry just saw this. Roadmaps matter a lot pre-reveal as it tells us how the team is thinking and where they want to go. If it is absent or doesn’t align with what I believe is important, then I won’t have faith that the teams’ values align with my own for my investment thesis…"
36,@ZAGABOND ngl I tried to find your articles of incorporation before buying :)
37,RT @zzbr33zy: surely i'm not the only (wannabe) ape that can edit their PFPs with an MB... right..? where are those apes at? 👀 #midnightbre…
38,"RT @quetumbar: ~ Super Midnight Breeze 95 ~

A free fangame for art, community, and increased NFT utility. 

In early dev. Proof of concept…"
39,"@dastormy1 This is a great idea, akin to rating agencies"
40,"With all the info now coming out on the Pixelmon founder and their “IP”, it makes me wonder: Where was all this diligence before people started dropping 3eth on it?

We must also show accountability to do research, and vote with our money by not buying into suspect projects."
41,"This vesting model should become the standard (more akin to what is in the Tech industry). However, what’s still missing is a mechanism to allow replacement / firing of founders or milestone based vesting, otherwise all we are doing is slowing down the rug pull. https://t.co/FSWShCDYDh"
42,@4n6_nerd @_9600_ Damn what clone did you have?
43,"@tansanDOTeth We are definitely going to be in some uncertain times. While I have a lot of faith in the long run, if the amount of money you have invested now can’t afford to be locked up, then it makes sense to exit. Macro situation is overall very bumpy…"
44,"@OGDfarmer 100%. Do proper diligence. If you don’t like what you see, don’t invest. But if you don’t even look, what can you expect?"
45,@raderry Consumer app at a very large tech company
46,@zzbr33zy I also got a couple 100 power hexas on solana if you want 😁
47,"Raising venture funding is the opposite of bad. It is massively positive for holders. Not only does this provide extra validation, but also runway assurance. Most importantly, it’s also non-dilutive to owners and increases probability of long term success. https://t.co/RdvY1sObG8"
48,"@alaric9896 Azuki had a roadmap (see mindmap on their website). But again, this isn’t fud. Just want to understand how to value what’s to come when considering price. Will be great to see what they share on the 2nd"
49,@zzbr33zy Haha you can wear whatever you want from my vault
50,"Overall, I still think we, as a community, need to hold project teams to a much higher bar than we currently are. We are funding vapor with the hope it turns into something solid; we should instead be funding something solid that can turn into something massive."
51,"- High mint prices are an investment in the company. This can be good if it’s a solid team with clear allocation of funds, or a money grab if they don’t have the necessary experience."
52,"- NFTs have flipped the investment model; we are investing before a product is actually built. This is EXTREMELY speculative; recognize this and be comfortable with the risk, or find ways to derisk by waiting until the team delivers or demanding more of founders."
53,- Buying pre-reveal is increasingly risky in this hype driven world. I believe this is the case as teams are setting bigger and bigger expectations to attract investment without understanding the difficulty involved.
54,- 3D art is risky. Think about the massive teams at AAA game studios and cgi shops; these aren’t small contractor teams.
55,"- If the roadmap or team is suspect, be comfortable paying the price for what you are getting today, not tomorrow. I’m happy to pay for today's art if I love it, even if it may not evolve into something in a few months."
56,"- Roadmaps need to be ruthlessly prioritized. Many projects seem to promise work that simply won’t move the needle, while deprioritizing things that may actually matter."
57,"…For these ambitious projects, having the art side alone simply isn’t enough. I am going to stay away from imbalanced teams, and from teams with little history to show."
58,"These reveal fails are teaching us a few things:
- We are over-estimating teams’ ability to execute. Do better diligence. As someone who ships products to hundreds of millions of users, I work with a team balanced mostly with engineers, followed by product and design.

59,@PhotographyPat8 @NFTooPerfect @EKC_DAO Wow great photography
60,(not fud) can someone point me to bull case data for 3landers that’s not just art and community? Debating buying in but roadmap feels a little hand-wavy…
61,@thenftbul @TheEverai @AzukiZen Nice inspiration :)
62,"PSA: any analysis that says “only X listings until Y floor!” is fundamentally flawed. 

Sellers/buyers near floor are often flippers, which means many listings will be bought and relisted multiple times before you hit your Y target. Floor can be much thicker than you realize."
63,@apebayc @AzukiZen Oof what an incredible deal
64,….am I the only one that still feels awkward tweeting about NFTs with everything going on?
65,@OGDfarmer You can open up a store with all that merch!
66,"@JackSitt @Rewkang @BoredApeYC That would make sense to me, could also help keep up FDV by tightening supply available at retail (I’m assuming most holders won’t immediately dump?)."
67,"@Rewkang @BoredApeYC I’d agree that we should be taking a much more bearish assessment on this, in particular on the FDV. Given the relative performance of the market right now for coins, I don’t think we should get our hopes up this high…"
68,@SDP808OD @AzukiZen @AzukiMV3 @samuelgildas @DemnaAzuki @retarteth ngl this is a pretty awesome custom
69,"@ape4007 @latteicecoffee The valuation question implies that we succeed in doing something with Bobu; if so, I don’t think it’s a stretch. If we don’t, there’s it’s still a premium over standard azukis considering his “role” in the lore. However, you have to be an Azuki fan to support the valuation"

71,"We’re in the awkward window where Twitter feeds are still showing pre-invasion tweets where we all pretended nothing was going to happen. 

Well, war just happened.

As fun and exciting as NFTs/web3 is, I’ll be reminding myself to never ignore what’s going on around us."
72,"The past 6 years have shaken up a lot of what I believed was “possible” in this day and age, but this is truly unfathomable."

74,@ZukiBun Yesssssss

76,@vinrock_ @AzukiZen Wait… this was on the floor??
77,"There’s no better reminder on how immature NFT markets are than so much liquidity being sucked out for a single hyped project (on top of macro forces).

This isn’t something we should all panic about. Instead, recognize the market forces at play and make informed decisions."
78,@OttoSuwenNFT The examples set by projects with a similar pattern hasn’t exactly been encouraging…
79,@ShrewdCharlie @InvsbleFriends Agree.  very… shrewd… of you
80,Yeah I’m not really buying the whole altruistic angle on this one… but hey looks like the strategy may work out for them.

84,@metawuhuama @dutchtide Ohhh it was you! Haha well at least I see you now have another Ash :) happy we both got some!
85,"@marchrighty Yeah some of them remind me of anime movies I loved, places I’ve visited, or experiences I’ve had. Makes for a lot of potential collection angles which is cool rather than just one concept of “perfect”. Although I do think mine is perfect :)"
86,@HairyPrivates Haha maybe I will
87,"I could write a long thread about why Midnight Breezes are a buy, but I’ll just say this: like great pieces of art, the collection has found a way to evoke memories, feelings, and emotions for me. This is far beyond a simple investment. Hard to find that these days."
88,@chrn69 @AzukiZen Now we’re watching you :)
89,@HairyPrivates @Bubblecuppa @dutchtide Wow so it was you I was watching! Saw those bids climbing and was afraid I was going to lose this
90,"Side note: if anyone wants to use this as their banner, feel free! We should all enjoy @dutchtide’s masterpieces"
91,@HairyPrivates @Bubblecuppa @dutchtide No way is that how far off you were?
92,"I've been eyeing this piece of perfection ever since I saw Midnight Breeze. When it got listed this morning, I knew I had to get it. Thanks @dutchtide for the masterpiece, this is the ultimate in mood, zen, and tranquility. To me, this embodies the collection. So excited! https://t.co/r48CXi7ykF"
93,@TurboDogg1 @dutchtide Let’s see yours!
94,@BastardGhosts @dutchtide Wow completely missed that!
95,@dutchtide @skittlewood It’s an incredible one… def one you’ll never collect a fee on ever again :) I don’t think I could top it no matter how much eth I spend.
96,"Ok you all got me, finally jumped in on the @dutchtide Midnight Breeze bandwagon. Picked up a few pieces to start off with an Ash and Rain filters. But my personal favorite, a perfect noodle shop. Love the vibes, can’t wait to add some more. https://t.co/zaeG9oZHmF"
