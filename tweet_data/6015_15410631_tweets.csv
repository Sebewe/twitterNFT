60,@raywylie @acltv What if I just gave money to your favorite charity in honor of you?  Could I get an autographed poster? I’d also hype up some soup or whatnot of course.
61,@muzzleofbees @mountain_goats Preordered a signed copy! Can’t wait.
62,@aufgehendeRest Just bought this and two other books of his based on your tweet! I feel like it’s going to be a long week.
63,"There's bound to already be books and MBA courses written on this - or maybe it has a name? (I've heard bike shedding might be one)  But there you go.  It's just a tweet now.

#data #math #lawns #sprinklers /12"
64,"So my lesson was this - sometimes I don't need fancy machine learning, data warehouses, advanced AI, or an expensive expert - to solve a problem.  Sometimes it's just simple math.  Sometimes I just have to let the landscaper go and do it myself. /11"
65,"So now, I just need to let the back run for 2.5 hours (0.4in*2.5=1in) and the front for 1.25 hours (0.8in*1.25=1in), then cut that in half in the dormant months /10"
66,There are 15 sprinklers in back and 15 in front.  The installer must've assumed they would then need the same amount of time.  But the sq footage of the back is larger than the front - and the water pressure is less in the back (a problem for another day). /9
67,"I was running it on both for 1.5hrs, once a week - 0.8in/wk in back, and 1.6in/wk in front.  That pretty much explained the problem.  But why are they different?  Well... /8"
68,"Twice, I placed 10 of them randomly around the back yard and ran the sprinklers for 30 min.  I then twice placed 10 of them in the front yard and ran the sprinklers for 30 min.  On average, my back yard was getting 0.4in/hr and my front 0.8in/hr /7"
69,I easily found that St. Augustine in Texas needs about 1in/wk while it's green (growing) and 0.5in/wk while it's brown (dormant).  Then I bought these little lawn sprinkler measuring cups /6 https://t.co/zN2WnsRIwc
70,"Recently, a college student I know, replaced his mom's brakes just by watching a YouTube video.  That inspired me.  I thought, ""Surely I can figure out grass"".  So a few YouTube videos later, and a handful of Google searches, I think I nailed it /5"
71,We've tried different types of St. Augustine too - thinking maybe one that prefers more sun in the sunny spots and one that prefers shade in the shady spots - might all perform better.  It was also suggested once it might be grub worms. But I was fed up - until today /4
72,"my back yard has continued to suffer.  Large patches just die.  It's thinning out in most places.  Twice, my landscaper has said, after a ""system audit"", that my sprinklers are just fine /3"
73,"For years now, my front yard's grass has looked amazing.  It's my favorite kind - St. Augustine.  I lived on an acre of it as a kid, ran barefoot through it, and learned how to make it whistle when you stretch a fat blade between your thumbs and blow.  But... /2"
74,"This is a story about data.  I promise.  And I recently let my landscaper go, well..., mostly because of the data /1"

83,"@TexasHistoryL @air_panther Couldn’t believe it until I tried it. Seriously it was great. I mean, yes, a giant ribeye is certainly better. But I was living on the edge. Ha"
84,@air_panther @TexasHistoryL Oh shoot. I forgot the rules! But I thought maybe there was a loophole since they have the best and only BBQ meatloaf in Texas. It truly is a great place. But if it’s got to be pork ribs then I’m at Iron Works BBQ on Red River. Had lunch there today.
