66,@Trophyyy @PlanetRock2012 @Nike We saw the same thing with Dave Chappelle and the apes a few months ago. Also with him being Nike CEO I know they are not stocks but I feel like it would be publicly disclosed that he was making those purchases. I get the impression it is a degen calling themselves JohnDonahoe.

74,"Logically thinking about this, if @WeatheReportNFT was only willing to give 5% to their artist what are they going to give back to the community? https://t.co/J4hjSUngr0"
75,Web3 is all about removing the middleman and supporting the creators with direct p2p interactions. So don’t support a web2 concept wrapped in the cloak of web3 aka @WeatheReportNFT. Any project that gives the artist only 5% is a red flag.
76,The art used in @WeatheReportNFT is not originally theirs and the idea was the brainchild of @DentedFeelsNFT which was proven through concept sketches and other evidence presented by Dented.
77,I am putting my $ETH on @DentedFeelsNFT because as the creator he will be able to continue creating and coming up with concepts for the community without outside help where as where will the direction of @WeatheReportNFT go?
78,Even though @DentedFeelsNFT has not sold out yet it is wonderful to see the power of web3. Instead of letting @WeatheReportNFT get away with highway robbery Dented released his own collection which has earned him more than 5% on his creations.
79,@DentedFeelsNFT would be nice to see you donate some of the money to support Ukrainian artist. As an artist who was taken advantage of you should be championing this and leading the pack showing that you value community. Community is what got you more than 5% for your creations.
80,@malka_napas @punk6529 @DentedFeelsNFT you should donate money from the mint to buy art from artist like Malka and other photographers in the Ukraine it is only right. As an artist yourself you should understand the importance of this and everything that has happen with you and weather report.
81,"@malka_napas Wish you the best of luck with your journey West. I couldn’t even imagine having to deal with that. Hope your family, friends, love ones, and pets are safe as well."
82,I will be spending my Friday playing Elden Ring. Good luck to all those embarking on the journey don’t break your controllers today. #ELDEN_RING
83,@RTFKTstudios @TheSandboxGame Leak that it’s only right in celebration of the release of Elden Ring today.
84,@RealCryptoPapii Nice and you got your M2. Dope set.
85,"@latteicecoffee I need a few personally. I think they will serve many purposes. They will be good gifts for people who are not aware of NFT's, newbies who want to get a blue chip exposure but don't have 10+ ETH, and for garden lovers to help build the IP and lore around Bobu and the Zukiverse."
86,@Robistraveling @takashipom @RTFKTstudios Knew someone was bound to snag this congrats on the snag.
87,"@solunavax People would be more trusting if there weren't scammers like you in the space. The fact that you are just acting as if you don't target people who are newly onboarded asking them for their keys,  taking advantage of their lack of knowledge. Now you post this garbage. What a joke."
