16,@mad_canvas No fud. Only moon. 🚀🚀🚀
17,@conanahere You tell me ser.
18,@jbondwagon @ColinLieb @kevwuzy I think we will get there eventually. Just need some catalyst
19,@jbondwagon @ColinLieb @kevwuzy Agree that M2s are undervalued considering that floor M2s are at 20eth while m2 serums are already at close to 40eth which is twice the price of the floor.
20,"@ColinLieb @kevwuzy I agree. But with Apes going to 100e and mutants having a price parity of 40-50% of apes, I think it is highly probable. At least for M2s"
21,@sgsaltysoldier LFG bro. Hop on.🚀🚀
22,@kevwuzy Indeed. Expecting mutants at least 100eth
23,"If mutants were at 50eth, BAYC literally airdropped me a house. 

Per mutant.

Probably soon."

59,@Catheri99373663 @BoredApeYC Congrats! Amazing sale!
60,"Many expressed that they would rather apes prices increase to where punks were at, instead of punks prices dropping. 

I think it will be more interesting if apes &gt; punks highest floor price(129E).

That day will come."

95,@ScrubbyCEO @conanahere Great discussion @ScrubbyCEO and @conanahere. I can see both sides of the picture. I am leaning towards being more optimistic as we are earlier half of the crypto adoption curve
96,"@ScrubbyCEO They can leave, which is part of the decentralized nature of DAOs. Nothing ties them here.

Projects where communities stay and build and gets reinvested will succeed. Bayc is not the norm. Its the anomaly"
97,"@ScrubbyCEO I would like to think that because apes own their own IP, they can interpret and build around that IP, as compared to management or shareholders directing a company."
98,"@ScrubbyCEO I see your point. I think in the case of BAYC the community was very strong from the start. Apes were following each other on twitter, many spun off their own projects."
99,"@ScrubbyCEO With DAOs and NFTs, we are seeing decentralized communities coming together to build a brand out of the projects they are like/invested in. This is a shift from traditional centralized corps and businesses"
