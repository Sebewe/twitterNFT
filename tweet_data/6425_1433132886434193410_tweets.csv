2,@loomdart Balls deep into the ecosystem if I may come in handy.
3,"@intocryptoverse - pandemic relief (momentarily)
- war ends (momentarily)
- Crypto broader adoption bc of global macro conditions
- stonks melt up
- DXY trend reversal
- grayscale BTC spot ETF
- China unbanning BTC mining
- Tesla reaccepting BTC payments
- BTC legal tender in more countries"
4,The only half political tweet ever from my side. We're all puppets. Essential that you see the strings.
5,European media telling us 24/7 how Ukrainians are heroes. Maybe they are. Tbh I have no clue what to believe but the amount of propaganda from EU/US/Russia/Ukraine is insane. Free brainwashing for everyone. Media influencing plebs is one of the most dangerous weapon this century.
6,"One of the best R:R is found in $AKT and $DVPN rn. Stunning projects, great developers. Invest in future web3 blue chips"
7,Hot take: Putin invaded the Ukraine just to buy the generational bottom of #bitcoin
8,@kava_platform Great milestones coming ahead but the design of this roadmap is very confusing. Don't like it at all.
9,Tbh most alts look like they're going to zero.
10,@nickkmne Most important thing is to take profits on the way up.
11,You cannot understand this price action if you haven't been in this space in '05
12,@paypay90000 I don't think tezos is a comparable chain. I don't hold and will most probably never hold any xtz.
13,@EseTeLopez @acpacpacp_ @wolfcontract @osmosiszone @junoswapdex I use CEX regularly to pay my bills...
14,"@acpacpacp_ @EseTeLopez @wolfcontract @osmosiszone @junoswapdex ""future is to be in digital assets, not fiat."" And how do you think nocoiners will get rid of their fiat and buy crypto?"
15,@lane1_mc @sifchain @scrtapes Thank you ser. Already am into several community pools on sifchain for a few months.

17,"@g6spot @starname_me Well, need to add that to my to do list for sure!"
18,@316Crypto Amen brother
19,@wolfcontract @osmosiszone @junoswapdex This is 2022 not 2032. There's no fiat on-ramp without CEXes. They actually play one of the most important roles in broader adoption. Using osnosis without any crypto knowledge is impossible. Think you're closing this door too early my bald friend.
20,@316Crypto So you really like doing this shit. https://t.co/HentSk6O2n
21,I don't hold any $eth anymore. Sold my last bag and bought $dvpn and $akt at this insane discount.
22,I'm not saying we won't go down further from this point. My pov is that this fud is transitory and trillions of $ might flood global markets when a) russia doesn't invade b) WHO declares pandemic is over
23,"When everyone is expecting the worst, that's where you buy, that's where life changing opportunities start. Worst case scenario is not priced in, yet. But an extreme relief rally might start when it's not coming like everyone thinks it will."
24,"RT @timalexandre: Had a dream last night. 
Which one would you chose
$OSMO or $JUNO? https://t.co/O8AMfBQ7xu"
25,"RT @sifchain: With Sifchain being the only Cosmos-DEX that supports listings of ERC20 tokens on it...

Which ERC20 token would you like to…"
26,"@timalexandre Cardano, fo sho!"
27,@timalexandre This super bowl ad will make the world fomo in $DVPN big times.
28,Fiat / crypto on and off ramp is way too complicated and centralized.
29,@paypay90000 @CryptoBanee So right! Everything in our universe is cyclic.
30,@CryptoBanee What is misleading?
31,Last time $ATOM had 7+ consecutive red days was in July (10 days) just before it found its bottom and started a 4x rally to new ath.
32,@SamStone408 A fucking bad joke. Won't laugh about it. This is not kindergarten. Several billion dollars are in this ecosystem. Not a thing to joke about.
33,This proposal would be harmful for $ATOM and the ecosystem. WTF is going on here? For me a clear no with veto. https://t.co/hckjBuPfO1
34,Hey @sifchain what about having some IBC asset / $ATOM pools? Would attract big amount of liquidity and help get more traction.
35,Gm. Interesting day with big moves in either direction ahead.
36,Shh... don't talk about $ATOM strenght. Don't jinx it again. 🤫
37,@timalexandre https://t.co/GuXYs7PCQF
38,C'est en faisant n'importe quoi qu'on devient n'importe qui
39,@grimy_trades I bought the absolute bottom at 41k
40,@The_Baxial We lucky it's already end of month 😁
41,Look how badly retail gets fucked. Institutions are buying big times while anons are panic selling. Imo most of you will be sidelined during the next leg up. Don't get fooled! Si tienes cojones... https://t.co/fFkGmCv4h0
42,@cryptouchdown Don't. Just walk away in silence. She deserves better than your liq'd broke ass.
43,Didn't think that we have to take that much of a hit but it slowly looks like last bulls are dying... https://t.co/1fGgDomP6r
44,Amazed how bears still find new coins to sell.
45,"@cryptouchdown Btw your pfp still has the rawpixel stamp on it. Too lazy to remove it, sir...? https://t.co/dY1O2UVcnI"
46,@foetzel77 Boi u still alive? Haven't seen you in a while bro
47,Tbh the amount of people connecting their wallets with twitter to have a hexagonal NFT pfp is scaring. Seems like they didn't get the point of decentralization and what it actually is all about...
48,@cryptouchdown You didn't buy the dip? Ngmi
49,Actually the most accurate multi month $ATOM TA on CT 🧐🥴 https://t.co/xvGjElNu2w
50,"@CryptoA34104165 A part is staked with rewards to osmosis. Other part is LP'ed. I like the pools of the people on sifchain with 300% APR. With another part I mint USDX on kava, LP and lend them. About 2k in rewards per week are put aside on coinbase pro for cashing out regularly to pay bills."
51,"@Tolkien_13 Nothing wrong with holding an ENS domain, is it?"
52,@datahoarding @vldprz @kava_platform They both in the cosmos my friends
53,For me there's no more DeFi outside of cosmos
54,@DagiDerese Let's hope it's just around where we are rn.
55,$ohm and its forks dying?
56,Consolidation under resistance is bullish in an uptrend. $ATOM
57,$KAVA's run continues. Now officially a top 100 coin. TVL at almost $600M. Kava 9 upgrade with IBC tomorrow 👀 https://t.co/0z3KZPU8DT
58,@Angel_san08 I'd try it on kucoin sir and use dvpn.
59,RT @timalexandre: Welcome to the Blufren Circus folks! Ready to send that $DVPN blufrog to the moon? ✨ https://t.co/HGyBajENEb
60,"@timalexandre Love it! Bluefren circus is kind of a freak show, too 😁"
61,"Do you know how big $KAVA is going to be after IBC? Tvl will surge as soon as cosmonauts get that there's up to 1700% apy on IBC assets at the beginning. Have a look yourself:
https://t.co/FSppwoItPd"
62,$DVPN looking extremely bullish
63,@CryptoDale I feel you. I have a baby girl at home as well and struggling alot with these 'security' questions. Long story short you did the right thing and I take my hat off to you. https://t.co/AHJICk8wBI
64,"@CryptoDale But congrats on that flex, dude. Must feel great!"
65,"@CryptoDale Thought about that alot, too. But never slaughter the goose that lays golden eggs. I'd rather put this money in to different stablecoin DeFi plays with lower risk (20-80% APR) and pay off the mortgage by those rewards. Win-win."
66,"So many people here on CT are over trading it hurts my eyes. Just chill, stake, LP and be a little more patient. I'm happy with these 5 figs monthly rewards tbh."
67,"@timalexandre Your place in this community is well deserved ser! Keep going, you're genious!"

69,"Posting bullish on $atom = 10k impressions, posting bearish = 200 impressions."
70,@foetzel77 https://t.co/xglENY3hp7
71,"$ATOM price action looks like (disappointed?) whales dumping their bags on hyping retail everytime it pumps. One day hero, next day loser."
72,"@btcjournal You can pool, lend and borrow btc (not native, yet) and earn passive income with your btc."
73,"Kava 9 upgrade in 12 days will connect the chain to IBC and let you borrow, lend and swap all IBC assets, $btc, $xrp, $bnb and more for juicy apr. $kava undervalued af.
https://t.co/o4bTj4npl8"
74,Talking about devs: Imo The biggest dev chads in this space are @gregosuri and @deeeedle.
75,During the last days I've sold some coins that showed disappointing dev action. Never hold a coin where the team is not communicating their progress. Every penny went in to that juicy $DVPN dip. My favorite project in crypto at only 85M MC. This is such a big opportunity!
76,$ATOM green again. Look at that strength against on atom/btc. Printing new ath anytime soon on both pairs and strait in to price discovery? LFG 🚀 https://t.co/gcFijcJDDj
77,$XPRT looks like it's popping very soon. Pretty convinced to find at new ath in the coming weeks. https://t.co/IKoj4ZzMI7
78,I don't know how @CoinMarketCap calculates the price of $DVPN but what they are doing here is just fucked up https://t.co/T6PAcd706k
79,As soon as $Atom hits new ath the whole cosmos ecosystem will get a lot of attention from $sol and $avax holders. The fomo will be hard.
80,@EvgPash This is a stupid ass who dumped on illiquid mexc. Look at volume.
81,$DVPN is u oke? https://t.co/bc7TOVUGiw
82,@gregosuri Totally undervalued memelord of cosmos: @timalexandre. Don't only gift the already gifted.
83,@Pentosh1 And en plus alt supply is shrinking bc a lot of the money is staked and in high yield DeFi plays. These high percentage returns are are factor that daytrading is becoming less interesting than farming and that's a point your statistics show.
84,@Pentosh1 Very nice thread. Imo this data is only half the truth bc dexes gain popularity. They have a staggering  $4.700.000.000 24h volume and not considered in this statistic.
85,RT @timalexandre: Secret #NFTs are going to be massive. This @hashoshi4 video is so simply explained you wouldn't want to miss it. At least…
86,"Ok sell your coins, delete your account. It's time to go."
87,RT @cryptouchdown: Only 2 months every cosmonaut was complaining about meme dog coins rising and leaving great FA coins like $Atom behind.…

92,@RunAwayInvestor Tbh 1M is more than enough if put in low risk DeFi plays. Passive income could be enough to even retire with 300k with higher risk plays if you cash out rewards monthly.
93,@adriana_kalpa @cosmos I have to tag 'the cosmos memelord' @timalexandre. He'll be able to retire very soon bc he wins every single meme competition. Putting in hours and hours of work for the community. A real cosmos gem!
94,@LukeYoungblood For me the main thing about web3 is that it is trustless therefore nobody but myself is holding my personal data. I can also contribute to web3 by selling bandwidth and storage space to decentralized open sourced projects.
95,@wbreakout @cosmos @solana https://t.co/F5GWNdDbEg
96,$ATOM pumping and outperforming most other assets means the next $BTC dump is just around the corner 🙄😁
