And they're profiting from the video until you find out.

Company does something vs community"
58,"@Monopoly907 @TRF_Stories @DappRadar My content has been stolen for profit many times. Most creators deal with this issue, especially Twitch streamers.

62,"@Desperado_Dave @TRF_Stories @DappRadar You're judging an entire industry in the earliest stage of development.
