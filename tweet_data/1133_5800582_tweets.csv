8,"@brockpierson @Pauly0x @ryder_ripps It’s very difficult to separate most mechanisms of generating income or generational wealth from constitutive racism. The dollar bill features a man who owned black bodies and worked them to death. Little is shocking, but we can hope Web 3.0 blue-chips deviate from the baseline."

10,"@wireless_pen @NFTherder It’s a wonderful defense when roving cancel mobs seek to savage strangers not based on actual carbon economy guilt — but based on hysteria, opportunism and petrol-sponsored impact mythologies.

39,"@drbecky_ Thanks for replying :-)

I appreciate that many observed subjects are niche/esoteric.

It just seems that exclusive access periods artificially enforce market-dynamics and meritocratic individualism. 

I’d love more top researchers to critique academy social justice shortcomings."
40,"@drbecky_ Institutional pursuit of enlightenment knowledge seems compromised by incentivizing researchers with financial and status rewards if they “play the game” around monetization of knowledge and status.

41,"@drbecky_ It’s as if the politics of grant-seeking, exposure-seeking, university brand-building and principal-investigator-historic-impact-aspiration gets normalized as an ethical baseline justify artificially gatekeeping results with exclusive access periods. Can’t cosmology do better?"
42,"@drbecky_ Why do they make scientists compete for time on these telescopes (in exchange for exclusive results access) like a sort-of career Hunger Games? 

Can’t all results be immediately public and bypass any sense of researcher ego or careerism? It’s more selfless and humanist that way."
43,"For context, this is the problematic @NASAWebb data access policy, which uses contrived access-scarcity for little good reason beyond control of press narratives and career/institution  exposure. Interpretation of data should be a global plebiscite.

79,"@Galliway_ @_mecyver What’s an equivalent of a 1990s celebration of distressed attire (e.g, Nirvana, Rage Against The Machine) in today’s urban spaces? Is there balkanization between that aesthetic and “shoeheads” or “Gucci/fly” adjective-users? Did one side lose a culture war? Is distressed profane?"
80,@_mecyver I wonder: Did punk and grunge mature in the 1980s and 1990s as aesthetics that celebrated a visually distressed “beater” look as a critique of the failures of prosperity? Can that ethos coexist with a love for the immaculate and undamaged as a symbol of achievement and wellness?
81,"@beaniemaxi It’s also controversial because we prioritize animating oppression as something that trickles up from interpersonal derision— rather than down from unequal political and economic power. Mincing words preserves a mythological, linear agency in impacting the substance of wrongness."
82,"@beaniemaxi I DO think poap whitelisting sometimes gets deployed as a bait-and-switch to inorganically bribe “organic” Discord and Twitter engagement, and that the fake-organic-reach scarcity of centralized/algorithmic social media worsens this problem — but whitelisting has more complexity."
83,"@beaniemaxi Whitelisting, as advocated by some proponents, is a mechanism designed to deter inequality of opportunity. From what baseline of “equality of opportunity” does it deviate in your assessment — and what is your alternative policy vision? What particular examples misuse/abuse it?"
84,"@beaniemaxi Can’t wallet whitelisting be part of a comprehensive, legitimate security process to enact human verification and deter botting? Especially in the absence of Discord and other centralized processes facilitating this reliably in the decentralized economy?"
85,"@_mecyver @sirsuhayb I do think the blockchain offers new ways for public art commissions on private property to redistribute wealth to artists.
