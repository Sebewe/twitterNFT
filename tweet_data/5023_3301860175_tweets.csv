23,"@kunstkeinarbeit I wouldnt say rarity. I would say ultimately theres got to be collectors who find a value to hold them. Theres also gotta be a demand for them.

39,@davidgokhshtein The problem with history is it’s only the winners point of view. Nobody ever gets to see both sides of war. Even we are aren’t being told with accuracy what’s going on. These days people are spoon fed info
40,Come out and learn from @CryptoTechWomen! I joined this project because they believe in education!!! Very important in #NFTs https://t.co/dOWNsC04By
41,@garyvee You as well @garyvee
42,@DOODBEASTNFT Floor is thin ngl. A quick sweep before this space would get the project trending on icytools
43,@QueennnNFT @Tajheev A true degen goes into opensea and types degen into the search bar and buys their favourite degen. Just saying 🤷‍♂️
44,Statements like this are bold and beautiful! When people making money in #nfts share the wealth! @HarrieCrypto keep up the positive vibes 🎶 https://t.co/cy9scBfibl
45,@Kratochvil8228 @BobbyBananasNFT I agree about celebs in the sense of celebs just pumping projects. If a celeb or athlete wants to buy an NFT and tweet about it and be part of the community like we all are I’m totally fine with this tho. I just hate to see all the projects using celebs to sell their NFTs 🤮
46,@BobbyBananasNFT @MaddKingMaddox I don’t think it’s a selling point in any way. I think it just helps manage risk
47,"@BobbyBananasNFT @Mor64n_ This is also true, but tougher to judge"
48,RT @BobbyBananasNFT: “Fully doxxed team” doesn’t do anything for me. Who cares?
49,@BobbyBananasNFT This isn’t a must for me but it does help to research into their past work to see prior projects or successes they may have had. I find you are ultimately investing in people more than anything in the early stages of projects. But I can give people a chance if they r professional

61,@yu_isaiah https://t.co/j3GtH86WB3
62,@yu_isaiah Yeah we went up quick. I honestly had so much conviction in this project right from the get go. And slowly minted more. They just announced in discord they are opening up a place in LA where all toonz can go in and collab with each other and there will be merch too
63,@yu_isaiah Floor is 0.8 right now. But no I don't think its too late to jump in. This project is all organic growth no crazy marketing and celebs are buying into the project in silence
64,@yu_isaiah From what I see yes tbh. I’m gonna sell 1 more and vault my last 3 on a ledger. This community is next level. I was paying 0.088 including gas

83,@yu_isaiah I want to take profits but it’s tough to know where this goes from here
84,@yu_isaiah See this is where I’m at now. I have 4 degen toons still but when I bought in my intentions were 100% to hold one for tong term but take profits along the way. Today I can’t sell one… I don’t know why… I sold one yesterday to remove my original investment but now floor is 🔥
