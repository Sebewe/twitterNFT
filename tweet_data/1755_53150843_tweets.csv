“Like” for WEB3 “RT” for WEB2

36,@ravisharmaYT @NFTCryptoChicks Haha yeah - I understand people’s concerns and risk tolerance - but that’s where the opportunities are… betting on ppl
37,@natbrunell You did excellent @natbrunell
38,My forecast for @NFTCryptoChicks 👀 https://t.co/T6HhEDxth9
39,"@propseth REITs have funky stuff in them. I wouldn’t hold in my liquid portfolio personally. But as a part of the illiquid portfolio, I think people should get longterm mortgage(s) &amp; buy home(s) in desirable areas. Something they get Utility from (so long as it doesn’t cripple financially)"
40,Do you have a PASSIVE portfolio that you think can beat this? “Risk-adjusted”? 👇🏽👇🏽⬇️⬇️
41,Why Bluechip NFTs? This is your “venture capital” “high-growth” “Moonshot” 🌕 🚀play. It’s also your ticket to participating in ⭐️communities and the happiness + benefits that come with it. This is the part of your portfolio (if you get right) that will help you retire VERY early
42,"Why ETH? This is your modern day “tech-platform-play” on the “internet of value” / web3 ; Your early investment in a future society which WILL leverage smart-contracts to function. It is disruptive to EVERY sector, &amp; is also the “currency of the culture,” connecting 🌏communities"
43,"Why BTC? This is both a “safe-haven” (defensive) and “metcalfe's-law-abiding” (offensive) asset, which bets on the digitization of (store of) value. It is also a “schmuck insurance” against incompetent politicians &amp; central bankers. Think about BTC as investing in safe “bonds”"
44,"Why QQQ? This is an index of blue-chip tech companies which are constantly rebalanced based on winners. Also, this is the only other “asset class” than #btc to outperform the money printing over the past couple decades. Tech does not “mean revert”, it ONLY exponentially goes ⬆️"
45,"Here’s a “fool-proof” “set-it-&amp;-forget-it” “all-weather” “non-degen” “get-rich-steady(but-faster)” LIQUID portfolio IMHO; free of charge, you keep the mgmt fees, also NFA🤫, across a 5-10 yr window:

1/4 QQQ - https://t.co/e2XPLHDIpG
1/4 #BTC
1/4 ETH
1/4 BlueChip NFTs

46,@ravisharmaYT Haha not sure about the “safest of all” 😀 but some of them are no-brainers for sure

48,Looks like safe-haven assets like #BTC and #ETH are doing not too shabby 😄

Sorry but not sorry for bag-holders 🤷‍♂️  - you can likely afford it https://t.co/958dwfTkAj"
58,@propseth Yeah totally agree. This is the most effective marketing possible. They can also say: “we’ve done this ourselves and therefore are in the best position to help you” — they’re also shit scared what blockchain technology will do to their audit business (all big 4s)
59,"WOW (@worldofwomennft) is not just fine art being auctioned next to Picasso, Renoir, Banksy, Van Gogh, etc., it is a MOVEMENT about inclusion &amp; ownership in the digital age
