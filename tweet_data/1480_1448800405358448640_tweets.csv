1,Anna Delvey would probably do well in the NFT game
2,Phase 4: Host a celebratory spaces. We need to hear the artist on the verge of tears because they just made 10 years salary in one night. Make grand (but vague) statements about pushing the boundaries of web3.
3,"Phase 3: Mint out and wait at least 48-72 hours to reveal, we need to keep secondary sales volume up to maintain royalty revenue before people see how basic your art is and lose interest. Remember to pay your influencers so they don't FUD you."
4,"Phase 2: Drop teasers of your 1/1 NFTs in the discord and twitter, but definitely not the floors. Ban/block ppl who ask pesky questions about future utility. Tweet a cute drawing for every 10k followers you get, yay! 🎉"
5,"Phase 1: Build hype. Prepare at least 3 cute drawings. Get a cool cat or BAYC with a big following to tweet about your project. Maybe buy a few thousand followers if you're struggling to get there organically, its not like anyone will know!"

31,"I'm starting to realize that buying ""mids"" is not usually a great investment in most projects. Seems like floors or top rares are the way to go. Where do you spend your ETH in a project you have conviction in?"
