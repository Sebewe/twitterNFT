80,"BONUS Thought Experiment

zkSync 2.0 can effortlessly add more data shards (already have 2 with zkRollup and zkPorter), and publish data on say, @solana

Using @zksync with data published on Solana is actually more secure than using Solana itself! (Validity secured by Ethereum!)"
81,"#2: zkPorter is magnitudes more decentralized than any other sidechain/L1

HW requirement: storing data availability &lt; Ethereum node

No threat of slashing: sign or don't

Don't want to run a node? Staking services in the works

&gt; Decentralization potential greater than Ethereum!"
82,"Data Availability Attack

Attacker controls sequencer + 2/3 of token stake

Submits *valid* block, signs zkPorter data, hides data from everyone

New blocks can't be created, your funds are frozen, but so is the attacker's stake

No financial attack incentive, only political"
83,"#1: zkPorter is magnitudes more secure than any other sidechain/L1.

Validity of the transaction is guaranteed by the zero knowledge proof, which is verified *on Ethereum*

This means in the worst possible case, the attacker cannot steal funds, only prevent you from spending them"
84,"[Recap]

But interacting with Ethereum is expensive.

Introducing zkPorter, an extension of the zkRollup where data is published off-chain and secured by token stakers via Proof of Stake. 

This enables 1-3 cent transaction fees."
85,"Defining Data Availability:

We must post some data about transactions with each block so that:
(1) the state of zkSync can be reconstructed from genesis
(2) we can create new blocks

Posting it on Ethereum is the best guarantee this data will remain available."
86,"Security can be split into:

(1) validity guarantee: no one can steal/spend your funds
(2) data availability guarantee: you can prove the funds are yours, therefore you can spend them"
87,"zkPorter by @zkSync offers 1-3 cent transaction fees, yet is magnitudes more secure and decentralized than any other L1 or sidechain.

In @zksync 2.0, zkRollup can seamlessly interoperate and compose with zkPorter.

eg Uniswap deploys on zkRollup for full Ethereum security, but zkPorter users can swap for 1-3 cents

All types of use cases, 
all types of users, 
1 system.

And it's EVM compatible"
93,"In zkPorter, data availability is secured by token stakers using PoS, enabling 1-3 cent transaction fees. 

Yet, zkPorter is magnitudes more secure and decentralized than any other L1 or sidechain. 

https://t.co/MI4OLfRODv"
94,"2. Data Availability

Data is posted on Ethereum via calldata. Ethereum is expensive, so this makes up most of the transaction cost. 

ZK Rollups can put this data somewhere else!"
95,"1. Computation:

In Ethereum, each transaction is executed by every node.

In @zksync, 1 node does the computation and produces a zero-knowledge proof of it. This is trustless.

Each node verifies this proof instead of doing the full computation, which is much less work

=&gt; Scale"
96,"zkSync is a ZK Rollup, the only type of scaling solution that fully inherits the security of the L1. 

To securely scale a programmable blockchain, we must scale:
