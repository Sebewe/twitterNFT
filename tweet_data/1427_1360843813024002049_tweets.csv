9,@JKB_90 @RTFKTstudios @RTFKTLukson @benitopagotto Nice that's impressive. I was wondering if you were trying to solve the quests or just doing a recap afterwards. Super impressive 👏
10,@itsmynamejef RTFKT has a very strong reputation for consistently pushing the boundaries in the NFT and digital fashion space. They also have knack for rewarding their holders.
11,@JKB_90 @RTFKTstudios @RTFKTLukson @benitopagotto 😄 well my gf and I are grateful so that's already two. Haha na but seriously I think more people will refer back to them as quest 3 continues
12,@JKB_90 @RTFKTstudios @RTFKTLukson @benitopagotto Welcome (officially) to the family. You're doing a service to the community with your vids (even if I'm the only one that's watched them all haha).

67,"@rayahn523 @InvsbleFriends @RTFKTstudios I'd sell for two monoliths. Over-hyped, unrevealed projects never end well"
68,@0xinc Weren't there people on the timeline saying Cool Cats to 80eth. Rip.
69,@darkpoolbtc Hahahaha fair fair! I had a little rage quit yesterday trying to layer my icing on the donut. Couldn't get it to snap on. Managed in the end but simple things are hard in the beginning lol
70,@clonexbot Lucky buyer. Wish I was liquid for this one.

77,@jastidesigns Ok I've come to the conclusion that you're definitely doing a redesign for your @RTFKTstudios space drip
78,@Jiran_z Wen gofundme for dog resurrection
79,@jastidesigns Hi
80,@AlanSeng @InvsbleFriends Oof yeah... If you have more than 1 clone then maybe more monoliths 🤔
81,@philosopherscln @jryanporter27 @RTFKTstudios That is epic 😍 you certainly have better luck than me. I had 6 vials and pulled 5 humans with zero drip😄
82,@missmerghu @Fereiliquid I watch on normal speed but I have it paused most of the time as I figure things out😄
83,@AlanSeng @InvsbleFriends Sell and buy another clone?😉

90,@L1lSketchy @Cookin_Jx @RTFKTstudios @jryanporter27 Ah sweet so I was right for only a day or so. Cool😄 I opened all my vials immediately so all vial info went in one ear and out the other after that
91,@jryanporter27 @RTFKTstudios Bruh I feel so embarrassed even though I'm just another anon on here😂

95,TIL mint vial holders got airdropped everything Clone X holders got airdropped. And here I thought I was completely versed in everything RTFKT 😬 https://t.co/9igd4CSbBK
96,@sknuevefc @RTFKTstudios @RTFKTNews @jryanporter27 Lol my bad my bad UNDOOOO aaaaaaah
97,@RTFKTstudios @jryanporter27 Oh snap. Just been schooled😅
98,"@jryanporter27 @RTFKTstudios Not opening a mint vial meant not getting the space pod, loot pod, and monolith airdrops👀 there may be similar risk to not opening a monolith 🤔"
99,@RTFKTstudios @beb_eth @ArtbyCrea They definitely deserve it! Congrats homies 🍻
