69,@Cryptofly777 @ViktorGrandim @_gusan @hoskytoken @SundaeSwap right and I totally get that. I always wondered why Sundae was valued based on total supply vs. everyone else on circulating supply. I just figured it was good healthy competition from Muesli lol
70,@Cryptofly777 @ViktorGrandim @_gusan @hoskytoken @SundaeSwap it’s not exactly fair to value projects based on their total supply market cap. It’s important to factor in how using the coin currently can reward you with more coins as they are put into circulation. By the time all coins are in circulation the standard MC could be much higher
