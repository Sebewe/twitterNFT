87,"@katlynkatsock @KBabyApes @LazyLionsNFT Two reasons I think apply to a group learning and wanting entry level NFTs:

1. Derivative of a blue chip NFT (@LazyLionsNFT) that is poised for a huge future, thus they’ll get halo value. 

2. Early NFT purchases IMO should have personal &amp; mass appeal. And should make you smile."
88,"@katlynkatsock @KBabyApes Totally. And seeing more @LazyLionsNFT derivatives too. Maybe these could be good options.
