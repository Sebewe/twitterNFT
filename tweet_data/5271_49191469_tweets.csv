3,@HollerLeanne Ape floor. Make 20 eth
4,@SpeKTrekZ @BoredApeYC https://t.co/ypuYW0m86Y
5,@CubanToast27 It’s a perfect portion with a few lines. 🎱
6,@ryder_ripps By the way you’re wrong and again trying to confusing history. The logo on the helmet is a double eagle which comes from Russian history in the 1800s. Maybe really do some investigating on facts.
7,@budgeth_ @Hawk_Dolliday @ryder_ripps Not a coincidence.
8,@fvckrender Not anymore but I’ll help you house hunt. Born and raised here
9,@17ikoola @beijingdou @SaintBayview @seeapefollowape @PrestigeWW19 @VegabondETH @dadjudicator I’d be down to trade you for a patch. https://t.co/SQNQPFprIL
10,@PuffYatty Freeeee!!!!!
11,@cdkns93 @btown_p Well what if you staked your ape to make $ape?
12,@Bornosor They got confused. It’s w3
13,@Bornosor Well now that people know we’re not going into WW3 I think they feel fine investing again.
14,@boredapebot Wow
15,@IrinaLiakh Thoughts and prayers are with you.
16,@rexwub I put in 9 eth got back 2. I’ll probably buy the dip.
17,I would think crypto would be a safe space for times like these.
18,@Ape2047 Also eth is way down.
19,Praying for the safety of our friends in the Ukraine.
20,@CBSNews Who was the idiot that pulled out of Afghanistan?
21,@fvckrender @SubwaySeanNFT Got 22m?
22,@boredapebot People are really just giving away 20 eth like that?
23,@JWeb777 I thought we gave up on those auctions? Im also thinking back to the time that 106 apes went for 18m. Free!!!
24,"@QualityNames_ @BoredApeYC What’s 5,000,000,000 / 35,000? 👀"
25,@WillyTheDegen I confirmed. It’s not but who knows..

31,@3LAU I’m sure if you made it a paid ad it would have been totally fine.

38,@MekaVerseBot Free
39,"@bubits_ For me personally, if I don’t know you or know of you, chances are I won’t buy. If you want to talk about your work with someone and it comes up in a conversation, that’s fine. But don’t make it the first words out of your mouth with the expectations of selling."
40,"@bubits_ If I didn’t ask, Dirty"
41,@lior_eth @0x_b1 @Herb_Castillo @mutant_cartel @BoredApeYC @ohhshiny Waiting on that trippy reveal. https://t.co/wUwWb332zg
42,@boredapebot Stolen?
43,@Steven_McKie @adelsreich @NetOpWibby @hnsfund @ensdomains @unstoppableweb @DotTheShake Not sure who bids even less than 1 but either way it’s a huge barrier for a typical end user.
44,@NetOpWibby @Steven_McKie @hnsfund @ensdomains @unstoppableweb @DotTheShake It is when trying to on bored people and then want people to adapt to use these as logins. I know subdomains would be easier but most people are going to want their own domain.
45,@Steven_McKie @hnsfund @ensdomains @unstoppableweb @DotTheShake One problem though is that you have to wait 2 weeks to get your name sniped.

48,@Loopifyyy 💀
49,@lior_eth @0x_b1 @Herb_Castillo @mutant_cartel @BoredApeYC @ohhshiny Who’s taking bets?
50,@BabyMilooo0 I’m okay if we all go. At least we can talk about NFTs the whole time.
51,@boredapebot Love this one. Great pickup
52,@RealCryptoPapii @BoredApeYC Mega!??
53,@Cents2Sats Trippy Mutant fam! https://t.co/1agdHDUQW7
54,@JamieGeorge93 @BoredApeYC @harrislipton93 The M1 trippys are so under valued.
55,@FFVV1211 Mint price 100 eth
56,@brian_armstrong The purpose of using the “call to action” was successfully done. Granted I don’t think you guys were ready for such a successful response.
57,@boredapebot Wot?
58,@Money_ape101 @KapitalCrypto @HolocronApe 👆poser
59,@boredapebot This is probably a safer way to put your apes on a hard wallet.
60,@boredapebot Freeeeeee
61,@theycallmeshwaz It’s like getting a box of these. https://t.co/L6DvXoY0QZ
62,@Thenizzar @BoredApeYC So what happens if all m2s are taken?

65,@RDM_41 I was thinking what if it’s going to be proof of stake? Hodl to earn.

76,@andrwwang Stormy weather with cast of unfairness. If you’re an artist working on a project. Know who you’re getting in bed with.
77,@boredapebot My baby is growing up so fast.
78,@boredapebot I remember when the floor hit 40 eth ATH and dropped down to 30  because people didn’t wait for mutants to get dropped. (Me being one of those guys) I’m holding till that coin drops.
79,@griillz_eth @TeamBloot @beaniemaxi Almost got me.
80,@boredapebot I’ve got 3 yetis who wants to trade some apes?
81,@boredapebot Lmao
82,@stevefink beanie cant dox himself again
83,@Bassjackers @coolcatsnft on brand
84,@Pizza_Later WTF?
85,@WildLipsNFT @BoredApeYC @AsherahEth @dt_chain 💯
86,@chrisjkeith @BobMeatwad @NFTethics Agreed it’s really toxic for the space. Like how can you call a project a rug if they never had a chance to launch? Where’s the rug if it didn’t rug? Giving someone the power to taint a project with 0 proof becomes a witch hunt with no trial.
87,@PhuckingEth @FreddieGibbs It’s not research. It’s a racist narrative which itself makes it racist.
88,@TheeHustleHouse @BoredApeYC @NFTraveler I won’t dox that tower ;) but glad to see you in the hood.
89,@kosmo_crypto @BoredApeYC @0xApes_NFT You mean real recognizes fakes?
90,@iloveponzi It’s a vibe
91,"For Mutant Monday, thought I’d share a wallpaper I made for the MAYC fam. @BoredApeYC #MAYC #BAYC https://t.co/wi1IkA60U4"
92,@NathanHeadPhoto Except for the eth I put into it.  Holding for 2 years like any other investment.
93,@Simon_Goldberg It did exactly what it was supposed to. The CTA got it 2nd position on the App Store and whole bunch of new sign ups.
94,@boredapebot The floor for M1s should be the same.

97,@coinbase https://t.co/HHVFEtFsGs
98,@0xAllen_ @phunk2243 They were in the show. They just didn’t have jpegs representing them.
99,@ryder_ripps I’m sure it was more like the NFL didn’t want to deal with the legal aspect of showing any image that they couldn’t have cleared. But of course you keep on with your dumb B.S. I’m starting to feel sorry for you. #daddyissues
