21,@theluvjonze @manimrityujay @veefriends We appreciate you so so so much ... I recorded a podcast with @celiapaulina and @markeetox yesterday and YOU and YOUR singing on @VeeGinaz broke the ice for Celia to engage with the #nftcommunity and now look at BOTH of you from that first interaction.  VEEFam always connecting!

23,@awo211 @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys They give you videos … you gotta know crypto though for sure to understand the readouts and TX hashes
24,@schmupergirl @awo211 @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys @jarrodT123 Agreed - it was a great “team building” exercise for the couples in the space!  Even more reason for BOTH to understand the finances of the household
25,@awo211 @schmupergirl @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys Before I jump to conclusions … the way I see it is they charged it as USD instead of the 1NFT amount.  I am not sure how much that changes my taxable capital gains.  @jarrodT123 thoughts?
26,"Just finished creating a custom CSV file for @ZenLedgerIO because all our ""lazy mints"" frm Opensea do not import as nft_mint which screws up the taxable amounts and sorts it all fucky.  

To all of my ""community"" projects - I love you more! 😉

crypto taxes - gotta do it right."
