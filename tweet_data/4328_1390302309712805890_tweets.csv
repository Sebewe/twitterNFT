1,"@Megthorpeart I’m trying to make a difference in the small ways that I can. Whether that be by sharing the knowledge that I’ve gathered over the past year, pointing people toward welcoming individuals/communities, or just being a person to answer the questions people may be too nervous to ask."
2,"@Megthorpeart Do I think the community needs to change and use more inclusive language? 100%. Do I feel like I can make a meaningful difference on that front? Probably not. When you point out the problematic behaviors to the individuals demonstrating them, it usually just empowers them more 😕"
3,"@Megthorpeart Same here, both in my IRL job (cybersecurity) and in my Web3 interactions. Planning on starting a podcast to hopefully help bridge some of the knowledge gap and onboard more women into this world 👩‍💻"

29,"@horndogdoteth That’s true. I think if the tokenomics are such that they can deliver some of these functionalities before most of the eggs are fully hatched, I think that should keep $milk relatively stable. Regardless, can’t wait to play! #wltc"
30,"@horndogdoteth I think that’s a good thing. If it’s too easy to fully evolve, I think the tokenomics will get thrown off. Do we know the utility of $MILK once the pets are fully hatched yet?"
31,@Megthorpeart GM ☀️ Hope you have a great one!
32,"@Trenkyy Understandable lol. We let our little guy out of the cone whenever he’s being watched, and put it on him when he’s alone/at bed time."
