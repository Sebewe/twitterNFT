18,@rekt_jak @blknoiz06 My point is you are popping into an actual head's comments talking random trash and you are literally a n00b who just started their account to talk trash on presidents and politics. foh and go back to facebook with that attitude.

43,@Nebraskangooner Wishing alt coins weren’t so boring compared to NFTs… 😂 also just really hard to reach over many thousand percent returns to grind yield somewhere or get locked up in some random pool or deal with DD on p&amp;ds… NFTs are also a major proxy for ETH for many people.

49,"@AlexMcCollister Yeah… it’s just so clearly grasping. Just don’t see people lobbing the same criticism at the innumerable commercials for eTrade, TDA, etc. just such a bad faith critique. One could also argue that, in the US, we all live in one big commercial for money… 🤷🏻‍♂️😂"

60,@0xinc Also really psyched to get the print from Matt whenever he gets to it. One of those sets with crazy wall appeal even without the live script.
61,@RivoliFrYS @haralabob @VentureCoinist @cryptopunksbot There are no fees (other than gas) as this is a free LL marketplace

66,@Seth_Ulinski @Hakatoi_ @RedGump_01 @cryptopunksbot Totally wild. But I go the reverse and say it’s insane that pieces of cardboard with ink on them are worth anything 😂 (as someone with innumerable cards in boxes gathering dust). Really fun to see this stuff take off
67,@AzaleaHathaway @Addictocrypt @RedGump_01 @cryptopunksbot Just imagine if you digitized your work and sold as 1/1 NFTs at auction in stead of your “eBay store”… your work would immediately be imbued with a more future proof type of value. It could change your life and updating you Luddite views is a must right now fren.
68,@ThePonziTrader @Addictocrypt @AzaleaHathaway @RedGump_01 @cryptopunksbot In no world is wearing LorO Piana as substantial as simply owning a punk (regardless if anyone else knows you own either). Punks are on another level of culture completely. One is literally and figuratively soft and the other is hard AF
