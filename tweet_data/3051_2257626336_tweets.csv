31,"@squawksquare At the same time $gm is going up, telling you the market is crazy"
32,@iamtomnash For no doubt! And that will fasten the process to get GM out of business because US market is the last frontier they can hold

49,"@Umbisam So he’s holding a lot of Long option now? Or he’s used by other institutes to spread good news now. As the short customers gone, long customers paying the bills. Gross"
50,@Umbisam @squawksquare The investor could price in the new factories since a couple of institute upgraded price based on new capacity. Now is not the past….
51,@iamtomnash It took him 2 days to write about scripts 🤣
52,"@stevenmarkryan totally agree, most people extrapolate using linear scale instead of exponential improvement on the factory as a product itself"
53,@Umbisam This company will become supplier for Tesla?

60,@marc_benton Good to have you out. Impatience like you will cause trouble more likely than bringing benefit to FSD. Good bye
61,Tesla Fud… Vw is going to overtake Tesla on battery. Close the article in 10 seconds. Thanks for the biased words to save my 5 mins https://t.co/v2yL1ALM7m
62,@TroyTeslike Thanks for inventory management insight. I would still say the model 3 part was conservative when it was down to 40k ish compared to 50k ish to Q1&amp;Q2.
63,@TroyTeslike I don’t follow the logic of tuning down Fremont production in Q3? Guess Tesla navigated the supply chain issue better than Q2
64,@TroyTeslike People truly underestimate the efficiently of Giga press. Will be much impressed with front Giga casting in place in both Berlin and Texas
65,@garyblack00 @WholeMarsBlog If they put more model 3 to the market right now don’t you think they will be gone within days? Demand is still way over supply
66,@garyblack00 @WholeMarsBlog Don’t you think this could be a production cap issue? Tesla chose to produce higher margin Y instead of 3 with current capacity
67,@Umbisam @greentheonly EU makes more sense to me. I think China has to wait
68,@Umbisam Where? Fremont?
69,@Umbisam He simply can explain things in economic or financial perspective. He didnt share common ground of visionary future in the community
