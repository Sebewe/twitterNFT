12,"Original wizard store = @CurveFinance 
Buckets = Liquidity Pools
Toys = Crypto tokens
Candies = CRV tokens (given out by Curve finance)
Chocolate = veCRV tokens
New wizards = @ConvexFinance @iearnfinance etc.

Curve Wars help companies ensure liquidity for their own crypt tokens."
13,"This word travels across the country and more wizards come to the town.

They all start offering powerful non-disappearing chocolates like the new wizards, in return of the voting power.

This fight for voting power is the principal behind the CURVE WARS."
14,"In return, by collecting everyone's candies, the new wizard keeps all the voting power with him.

With this massive voting power, he can vote for buckets that contain his favorite toys to give out the most candies. 

That way, his favorite toys will be the most popular as well."
15,"This chocolate NEVER disappears.

As long as your candies are locked-in with the NEW wizard, you get maximum possible # of candies from each bucket that you have lent your toys to.

Plus, you can exchange your chocolate for your candies whenever you want!"
16,"Now, another wizard comes into town.

He sees all the excitement and makes the following proposition to you:

""Instead of locking in your candies with the original store, hand in all your candies to me, and I will give you a MORE powerful chocolate."""
17,"In other words, the wizard has created a FLYWHEEL system in the store:

Lock-in candies -&gt; Get magical chocolates -&gt; Get more candies in return -&gt; Chocolate disappears eventually -&gt; Lock-in more candies -&gt; Get more magical chocolates -&gt; Repeat."
18,"There's one catch: The MAGICAL chocolate disappears linearly over a few days and you lose the powers. 

To get the powers back, you need to lock-in more candies with the wizard.

Plus, until the chocolate disappears completely, you cannot get your locked candies back."
19,"The more candies you lock-in with the wizard, the more # of chocolates you get.

Higher # of chocolates means higher voting power and higher # of candies.

Eg., If you have 2 chocolates, you can get 11 candies from bucket 1 and your vote counts double."
20,"1.) For as long as you hold the chocolate, you will get more candies per bucket.

Eg., 8 (instead of 5) candies from bucket 1, 12 (instead of 7) candies from bucket 2, etc.

2.) Everyone who holds a chocolate can vote to decide how many candies each bucket gives out."
21,"One day, you go to the store to collect your candies, and the wizard makes you a proposition:

Read in Gandalf voice:
""If you store your candies with me instead of taking them home, I will give you a MAGICAL chocolate""

This chocolate has 2 powers:"
22,"Let's say you have a racecar that you don't use anymore.

You can go and lend it to Bucket 1, and collect 5 candies from the wizard everyday until your racecar is stored with him.

After this, begins the MAGIC:"
23,"If anyone comes in and lends their toys to the buckets, the wizard gives them some candies in return.

The number of candies depends on which bucket you lend your toy to. 

Eg., If you give a toy to bucket 1, you get 5 candies/day, bucket 2 gives 7 candies/week etc."
24,"Anyone can go in and swap one toy for another within a bucket.

Now, the store is run by a very smart wizard. He use his wizardry to ensure that the buckets never run out of toys.

How does he do that?"
25,"Imagine there's a MAGICAL toy store in your neighborhood. 

This store has several buckets. Each bucket  has 2 kinds of toys (cars and barbies in one, transformers and superman in another, and so on)"

64,"14/14:  The CRV tokenomics not only align incentives across participants &amp; platform, but also improve the supply-demand dynamics of the CRV token.

The system doesn't come without drawbacks, but it's a major step forward in how DEXs and DAOs operate."
65,"13/14: GAUGE WEIGHTING

veCRV holders can vote to decide the share of newly minted CRV allocated to each pool.

This enables the incentivization of new pools, theoretically without impulse needed from the Curve team."
66,"12/14: GOVERNANCE POWER

veCRV holders can submit and vote on DAO proposals, and have a say in the key parameters of the system."
67,"11/14: BOOSTED REWARDS

LPs can use their veCRV tokens to boost their pools, increasing the CRV earned up to 2.5 times.

Basically, LPs can lock CRV to earn higher CRV.

Result? Higher overlap bw tokenholders and LPs means the 2 groups don't compete for the same fee."
68,"10/14: SHARE OF THE FEES

50% of all trading fees is collected and distributed to veCRV holders."
69,"9/14: veCRV TOKEN

ve stands for 'vote-escrowed'. On locking CRV tokens, you get a veCRV token.

4 years will give you 1 veCRV per CRV, decreasing linearly to 0.25 veCRV per CRV for a one year period.

""Why should I lock my CRV at all?""

Cz it gives you the following benefits:"
70,"8/14: TIME-LOCKING

Just like SushiSwap, Curve is governed by its own token, CRV. 

But, to participate in governance and attain full benefits of CRV, holders are required to lock their tokens.

Locking period can be anywhere from 1 week to 4 years."
71,"7/14: THE CURVE REVOLUTION 

@CurveFinance recognized these problems and launched the 'veToken' model.

 Let's understand what that means"
72,"6/14: While this is a major upgrade over the Uniswap model, it presented its own problems:

i) The utility is limited to governance.

ii) The ever increasing supply means a downward pressure on the $SUSHI price."
73,"5/14: SUSHI holders can vote on governance decisions for SushiSwap.

Holders therefore, see 'value' in the SUSHI token &amp; are invested in the platform's growth. 

Plus, 2/3rd of the SUSHI rewards are vested over a 6 month period.

This ensures the large LPs can't suddenly leave."
74,"4/14: THE SUSHI TOKEN

Just like Uniswap, SushiSwap charges a 0.3% fee on the trades.

0.25% of it goes to the LPs.

The remaining 0.05% is converted to SUSHI tokens - and distributed to all existing SUSHI token holders as a reward."
75,"3/14: This was a great solution at a time when AMMs were new in the market.

But, what if most of these LPs decide one day that Uniswap is not worth it and withdraw their money?

Uniswap will basically be left helpless. 

This problem was then solved by SushiSwap."
76,"2/14: UNISWAP'S SOLUTION

Take 0.3% fee on every trade and distribute it to Liquidity Providers (LP). 

Earning money for storing tokens attracts more people to invest in the liquidity pool.

Bigger Pool ➡️ Less Slippage ➡️ High Trade Volume ➡️ Higher revenue for LPs"
77,"1/14: Imagine the year is 2018. You're building an AMM from scratch to help people swap their tokens.
