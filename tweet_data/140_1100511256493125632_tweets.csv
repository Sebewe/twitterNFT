73,@ape2546 @eBay I guess better put I don’t see why having both options wouldn’t be better if you’d prefer to receive fiat or crypto. And we are talking about huge aggregate transactions given the amount of money transacted on eBay daily. I don’t understand your point on me being short bitcoin?
74,@ape2546 @eBay It has more to do with instant transaction finality than it has to do with simply being able to convert fiat to crypto while incurring intermediary fees.
75,@ape2546 @eBay Removing central banking intermediaries to be forced to convert dollars to crypto seems like a positive option imo. A big goal of decentralization. Say I receive USD during time when bank is closed and my conversion is delayed - not optimal.
76,"@NFT_Shooter @eBay This is true but I’d rather skip the central bank intermediary conversion step to begin with &amp; have the reverse option in converting btc to fiat become the standard. Every extra transaction fee, especially on eBay, adds up. It also optimizes dollar cost avg. when mkt is volatile."
77,If I can sell on @eBay with bitcoin pricing I’d list everything at lower prices knowing my income could actually grow over time. True asset trading versus taking dollars that buy me less tomorrow for a collectible sold that will accrue more value than the fiat.
