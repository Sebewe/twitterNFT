2,"@BrownBaddiesNFT Posted a few things below, after chatting with a fren.

But yes, people don't like Discord –– it may be the best solution we have atm. 

Tho, i'm actively trying to challenge that in seeing if theres ways to build a community and achieve a sense of belonging w/o it."
3,"@doodlesdeso @WGMInterfaces @adamceresko @metalinklabs @IslandsXYZ Rn, that’s challenging, but maybe can be done dependent on the project.

More to learn here. Still thinking through this. But thanks @doodlesdeso for taking some time to chat through this with me. Super helpful!"
4,"@doodlesdeso @WGMInterfaces @adamceresko @metalinklabs @IslandsXYZ Some projects like Art Blocks could survive w/o a discord, but a lot of times these projects may be looked at as investments vs. pieces you identify with.

IF a sense of belonging can be achieved w/o discord, then we’re golden."
5,"@doodlesdeso @WGMInterfaces @adamceresko @metalinklabs @IslandsXYZ Offline convo w/ @doodlesdeso – posting a few learnings to share.

People want a sense of belonging with NFTs. 

Rn, discord is one of the best ways to achieve that by creating a place where people can belong, feel close to leadership, and share relevant things to their community"
6,"@doodlesdeso @WGMInterfaces @adamceresko @metalinklabs @IslandsXYZ Will DM you (ironically on Discord). 

Actually interested in chatting through this, because I'm actively thinking through this rn. 

I might have digressed as I replied, but I think the initial tweet still stands. Will explain in DMs."
7,"@doodlesdeso @WGMInterfaces @adamceresko @metalinklabs @IslandsXYZ Still believe most NFTs don't need it, not saying every NFT/community doesn't need it."
8,"@doodlesdeso @WGMInterfaces @adamceresko @metalinklabs @IslandsXYZ is another example of something being built that's interesting.

@WGMInterfaces may not have made it to mint, but they found ways to grow without Discord. Also, don't think not having Discord was their failure point, tbh."
9,"@doodlesdeso @WGMInterfaces ended up shutting down.

But they're a good example of someone who ran a project without a Discord."
10,"@doodlesdeso Different platform in most cases, internal communication in few.

It depends on purpose of the project is.

Discord tends to be used for realtime updates + communication during events (i.e. – minting).

A lot of this can be done w/ tools outside of Discord with less overhead 🤷🏾‍♂️"
11,"Thinking out loud 🤔

Community ≠ Discord.

Not all NFTs need community. Not all communities need Discord.

 🔥 Hot take 🔥 

Most NFT communities that exist today don't need to be using Discord. Most members of those communities would be totally fine w/o it.

It's overkill ☠️"

75,@calebwright @kallawavy @ShinyObjectSC Love this.
76,"@MoalNft @crypto_mo_nft Nice! Will definitely look into this.

By dynamic, I mean the pfp you buy actually changes in different ways by different mechanics. @RubberDuckBP is a good example of this."
77,@amritpaldesign Your work is dope 🔥
78,"@NounCats @tombornal Interesting.

So the goal here is the create relationships between people searching for their Nounterpart? I like that.  

Will certainly be keeping an eye out to see how this plays out 🙃"
79,"@NounCats @tombornal Fascinating. 

So these are two separate collections of 5k. Invisibles mint first. Given free mints 1:1 for Cats. Then they have to find their respective Nounterparts to mint a new Noun Cat.

Is anything burned in the process? Or are you introducing a third collection of 5k?"
80,"@MoalNft @crypto_mo_nft Hmm... is the NFT itself dynamic in any way?

Cool idea, but this more so looks like a fund for the artists in residence to then drop art for members."
81,"@collects77 @ShadowQuest_NFT Definitely. Max minted @ShadowQuest_NFT.

Any non-p2e's you have in mind?"
82,"@mattpublic @ShadowQuest_NFT Oh mos def –– max minted @ShadowQuest_NFT.

But, I want to learn more about mechanics of projects that aren't built to be p2e's –– that's a whole other convo."
83,"Some of interesting ones I've read on:

@RubberDuckBP 
@arsfunktronica (dreamgardens)
@doodles (Space Doodles)
@capsule_house"
84,"I have been quite fascinated with the mechanics of some NFT projects lately.

Going to be doing a deep dive this weekend.

What projects have some of the coolest mechanics?"
85,"@kallawavy If you do Blender, I may join you on this journey.

Would be sweet to have a group learning in @ShinyObjectSC together."

High quality thread @nbashaw. Going to have to bookmark this to fully digest this again."

91,"@Zeneca_33 @ZenAcademy_ That’s what I get for typing fast 👀

“Here to learn long term..”"
92,"@Zeneca_33 @ZenAcademy_ I’m hear you learn long term and build for underrepresented communities. 

We have stories to share. I want to use web3 to amplify these stories.
