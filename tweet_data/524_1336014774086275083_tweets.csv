38,"@ECOMYECO @LooksRareNFT @opensea WETH/ETH rewards were sold, none of their $Looks. There is so much FUD &amp; what seems to be PTSD from anon devs. I understand and sympathize, but @LooksRareNFT is providing a cheaper/reliable service than competitors, and rewarding users. Everyone needs to reevaluate assumptions"
39,Well looky looky 👀 Constantly delivering and communicating 🙌🏻 https://t.co/kDuDM16cY1
40,@Mantaroth @LooksRareNFT Knew you’d be stoked for this 😂
41,@OGDfarmer Canada is one step closer to communism… Government controls everything and everyone.
42,"@ArtHouseGarbage @LooksRareNFT *cough* OpenSea anyone? I would love to know what they do with all the money they have made. No customer support, exploits fixes delayed, no user base rewards, etc. LooksRare is doing a great job and are providing a service. What they do with their earnings is up to them."
43,"@MAYCBoshi @BCorgi12 @LooksRareNFT Not everyone got compensated, many people still have outstanding issues from over a month prior."
44,"@0xAllen_ Hilarious everyone pointing the finger. Nevermind BrokenSea taking all the profits and they still can’t communicate effectively to their user base, fix exploits, etc. @LooksRareNFT is providing the service at a cheaper rate, fixing problems, rewarding users, &amp; communicating!"
45,😂 I keep seeing people saying @LooksRareNFT is a cash grab. Pffffft wtf do you think @opensea is? Service’s that hopefully generate revenue… LOOKS is giving back and communicates! You guys need to chill out and support the changes we keep asking for
46,@hexagonxyz @metavatar_app Wagbi.eth
47,@ZoddLooksRare @mooncat2878 @LooksRareNFT @gemxyz @geniexyz Crushing it 🤙🏼 You guys are doing awesome and will continue to bat for LooksRare 🙌🏻😎🔥👀
48,@210Gwei @ZoddLooksRare @0xShitTrader @LooksRareNFT Take a chill pill man. It’s a free market and you are welcome to participate however you see fit. You are not obligated to use Trezor with MetaFox… if you want to use LooksRare with a Trezor there are ways. LooksRare is 1 month old… take it easy. They are doing amazing work
49,"RT @ZoddLooksRare: @DegenSpartan (1/6)
To address this:

First off, the amount is incorrect: it’s closer to 10,500 ETH and we have 10+ full…"
50,"@210Gwei @ZoddLooksRare @0xShitTrader @LooksRareNFT It wasn’t a problem with Trezor or LooksRare… it was a problem with MetaFox, get your info straight. If you used a different eth wallet with a hardware wallet it worked fine. You could’ve used Trezor with Frame wallet no problems at all. DYOR instead of jumping on the hype wagon"
51,@niemerg Zero knowledge proof 🤔 Amazing stuff
52,@SwoleLuksoBags Ah very good. Good to hear. I’ll give it a go. Always looking for thing to help improve life. Thanks for the recommendation 👌🏼
53,"@SwoleLuksoBags Have you stopped using it for a period of time like two weeks, then had again to see the difference? What noticeable changes have you observed?"
54,@ape7458 @Okasian670 Congrats!
55,@ape7458 @_awesomeApples 1337 😎
56,"Anon to decentralized platform - “Do something about _____ project/group, protect your users”… 🤦🏻‍♂️ welcome to decentralization! DYOR take responsibility. Call out the exploit, make it known. Don’t try and make things more centralized… *sigh* C’mon man"
57,@khumaix Amazing shot. Although… I thought @JustinTrudeau was the most elusive creature on the planet? 😂 Couldn’t resist.
58,"@ElYogui_PA @LooksRareNFT Great take, thanks for sharing. It’s helpful to read the different views on the platform. It’s disappointing to have people in the community be so off-putting with @LooksRareNFT. I am stoked that a community focused platform with good communication has finally arrived! 👀"
59,"@DEXXADNFT -20°C beautiful blue skies, sun is shining and no wind. B-e-auuuuuutiful day 😎"
60,@KarafuruNFT Is there a high resolution version of this poster somewhere? It is awesome! 🔥
61,@lonestarsacca Boy oh boy!Thank you kindly good sir for the raffle win! Got a @pixelvault_ Saturn Dao! Thank you!
62,"@MAYCBoshi @Zg42_21 I see your point. It certainly was a bold move and inevitably it increased volume which in turn increased the amount of fees that were generated, then back to those who were staking/committing to the platform. Maybe royalty free projects don’t collect rewards? Would that work?"
63,@MAYCBoshi @Zg42_21 Reward people for listing? Not sure how that would work without being exploited. They do reward sellers with $LOOKS. Easy to swap on a dex. I think they are leading the pack with rewarding the community. BrokenSea doesn’t even fix exploits or communicate with their user base…
64,@Zg42_21 Here here!
65,@gridplus @patrickjamesNFT @blasteasy @EthereumDenver https://t.co/wdCE0mvZUG
66,@carsonturner @KarafuruNFT Love the project. Managed to snag one before the reveal. Stoked to get the toy version eventually 😂
67,"@MattSteffanina @Gfunkera86 @tropoFarmer @lonestarsacca @punkscomic Niiiice, managed to snag both of those as well 😁 Always get stoked getting to read the comic as well 👌🏼"

72,"@hildobby_ @DuneAnalytics Awe yeah 😎 Congratulations, that’s awesome"
73,@ZullupFromSpace @BoredApeYC Dude… the textures are insane. Amazing work!
74,@F4ntast1cMrF0x Interesting take. I mostly agree with what you’ve shared. What’s your take on @pixelvault_ ?
75,"@dingalingts @QualityNames_ @danfinlay @LooksRareNFT @MetaMask @Trezor Exactly. You could use other eth wallets like 0xframe, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet. There are other options other than the MetaFox"
76,Big shoutout to @KrayTrain for her merch raffle! I was given the opportunity to purchase a the BAYC Rolling Stone Mag. Sooooo stoked to get it and frame it. Thank you! Stoked! #BAYC @BoredApeYC 🍌🦍
77,@digging4doge @SlamDiegoZoo @LooksRareNFT @0xFrame @gridplus Me too. Stoked to give it a place on my desk as the main control centre 😎
78,@digging4doge @SlamDiegoZoo @LooksRareNFT @0xFrame Download @0xFrame follow the onscreen instructions. If you’ve been using the MetaFox you’ll understand I think. It auto detected my hard wallet no probs.
79,@SlamDiegoZoo @digging4doge @LooksRareNFT @0xFrame I like the wording “battle tested” haha. Not sure what you’re looking for but with a hardware wallet it’s solid. As with most the things DYOR. I’m part of the converted. Got Frame and waiting for my @gridplus to pair with it 👌🏼
80,@NFTLoverBoy @SlamDiegoZoo @digging4doge @LooksRareNFT @0xFrame I have been using 0xFrame wallet with no problems and prefer it over MetaFox. There was supposed to be a patch fix on 7th Feb if I remember correctly. It’s a known issue and LooksRare is actively working with the Fox it seems. Thankful we have options nowadays though
81,"@SlamDiegoZoo @digging4doge @LooksRareNFT It’s not a LookRare problem, it’s a MetaMask problem. If you use @0xFrame eth wallet it works with Trezor flawlessly on @LooksRareNFT"
82,"@azfnft Thanks for sharing your perspective, it’s appreciated 😎🤌🏼"
83,@riskyassetbtc @azfnft Just swap LOOKS for ETH?
84,👀 https://t.co/gL7TCkytSP
85,@RAC Extremely short sighted. This confirms we are still early. Slowly then all at once. Keep it up @RAC
86,@Mantaroth @LooksRareNFT Agreed. They are doing a fantastic job and are pivoting super quick at any suggestions or problems. Amazing team doing incredible work.
87,@negithenagi @ensdomains Very nice 🤌🏼
88,@KrayTrain RAFFLE RAFFLE RAFFLE 😁
89,@SaintBayview @BoredApeYC @NeonApesYC Duuude I’m so excited for mine! @NeonApesYC you do some beautiful work my friend 🔥🤯
90,@NeonApesYC @imalexseguin @LooksRareNFT Those DM links are always 🔥🤣
91,"@ttroja_ @LooksRareNFT Completely agree. I am optimistic for the future of $looks and excited. Wanted to see what others were thinking. After seeing the analytics from @hildobby_ it made me curious to see what others reasons were other than “nUmBeR gO uP, bIg aPR! i wAnT!” 😂"
92,"@ttroja_ @LooksRareNFT Huh, from what I’ve been reading it’s mostly to do with the amount of wash trading. Now that the rewards will be half in the next few days, that will consequently make wash trading less feasible therefore lowing trading volume. Then effecting the amount of fees actually earned"
93,"Alright guys. Been reading this and many opinions on @LooksRareNFT and what’s to come in the next couple of days regarding the rewards halving. What are your thoughts? Optimistic, cautious, pessimistic? I have hope for an OpenSea killer and I am rooting for a community led one https://t.co/kayE54a8SP"
94,@HadjPadjOptions @LooksRareNFT Oh wow that is a difference…
95,"@HadjPadjOptions Hmmm quite the difference in volume. Almost a 10x change compared. I think you’re right with the other collections linking to @LooksRareNFT, and the importance of having the ability to be directed there. Especially for the new users. OpenSea still holds onto its brand recognition"
96,@HadjPadjOptions Just reading through @hildobby_ thread about filtering wash trading
97,@HadjPadjOptions How can you see everything apart from the wash trading?
98,"@HadjPadjOptions Huh that’s interesting. Why not $4? I think if trading volume keeps up it should be higher. I mean, the largest factor is the amount of trading happening on the platform. Essential for the whole thing to work"
99,"@HadjPadjOptions I’m optimistic about a team that is in the community, especially being so active. I love fact that the community can share in fees, that is huge. Even with the rewards halving I believe that the effect will be something similar to a btc halving."
