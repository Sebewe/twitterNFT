19,@pretlovedoteth @huxleysaga okay well that's even more awesome
20,@pretlovedoteth @huxleysaga Saw a 30s clip in PVFD so if that was it then yeah. Looked cool
21,@pretlovedoteth @huxleysaga I think I’ve been sleeping on Huxley

31,@HierophantNYC Hello Anon. It was a cool puzzle game with daily riddles but soft rugged after a few months or so. Completely dead now
32,Elite Ape Coins

41,@dustmonkey_ Today is a good day! Nice weather too. Thanks for asking ❤️
42,@beelemz @LittlelemonsNFT Bro I remember bidding on this like crazy
43,Can’t wait to wear my @ShoeRare physicals 🔥
44,@PermaRich @0xQuit Personally I would recommend claiming and dumping. Though make sure to revoke all approvals after the claim. I got 0.6 ETH by doing this
45,"@YoshioFX @0xQuit I mean, it’s either some free eth now or nothing later"
46,Guinness and steak. Feel like I have to give @dustmonkey_ a tag https://t.co/fEMlOdZYJ9
47,"@Sarahj1919 @hunterorrell That would’ve been epic, but I live in Sweden 😄"
48,@Sarahj1919 @hunterorrell 👀
49,@Playboi_ARTi @ArkkEsthetik @Loopifyyy You can’t make listings without approving collections?

52,@pixelvaultbot What a steal
53,"Claimed and dumped by x2y2. Free 0.6 eth. not bad
Make sure to revoke any approvals"

55,@krohni989 @forthunion1 @NedRyersonBing @pixelvault_ Yep 1000 owned by PV themselves and 200 will be minted and distributed to Metahero Core and Special Edition Comic 1 holders
56,@kerfunkl Pretty bad vault if they are selling directly from it
57,@RustySailor_ @pixelvault_ @punkscomic @MetaHero_ PVFD also to be a functional DAO in 1-2 months
58,"RT @HabboNFT: Six future uses for NFT credits, a thread 🧵👇"

61,@itstylersays My heart rate would go down
62,@tropoFarmer @Coinbase_NFT @Pudgy_Penguins I will build a shrine of you and pray to it every night if you make this happen
63,@Coinbase_NFT @Pudgy_Penguins 💀
64,@FutureFinance9 @tropoFarmer @Coinbase_NFT @HAPEsocial nice choice
65,Bloot x Coinbase 🟩🤣 https://t.co/5W8XnH6xky
66,WAIT. Before the release of the comics I was certain there would be specific ape coins. That's it. Burn your coin for a copy of a specific ape coin... and then that also needs to have some utility... https://t.co/yEAHS71Ojs
67,beanie could have just stayed active and released ponzi schemes and people would still have bought them
68,@lildurk damn just got that jacket in my mail today
69,@Ape2047 forgot PVFD
70,"I can't even think of any good guesses. Something involving burning and the elite apes themselves. Maybe upgraded holographic versions of the comics? But seems like a reach, they are already limited special editions."
71,"Elite Ape Entry Coins seems like a pretty good buy now. Confirmed utility that is already being worked on. Granted, we have no idea what it is, but it's Pixel Vault so I'm sure we won't be disappointed. I own 6.

They are working together with the Elite Apes.. what does it mean? https://t.co/bWz6FlmCoM"
72,@junjunjun888888 @BoredApeYC That's a lot of bloot emojis

75,@hunterorrell thanks
76,RT @SwaggyCows: Tons of projects with high mint prices now... Remember Swaggy Cows is only 0.01 to mint and you get a free Swaggy Moose too…
77,@Travelerzzzzz @punkscomic Soon 🔜
78,@punkscomic Okay but when Bloot Origin story? 👀🟩 @Gfunkera86
79,@MobsterNft @HabboNFT That’s a lot of ETH
80,@benmayorwhite @adidas Love what you’ve done so far. Good luck to whatever the future holds for you🤝

82,@pretlovedoteth @Gfunkera86 Damn what a flex
83,@niftVR @TeamBloot @geniexyz @RTFKTstudios @pixelvault_ @hunterorrell @tropoFarmer @Sarahj1919 @Sarahj1919 can probably unban you if you want to be in the server
84,@niftVR @TeamBloot @geniexyz @RTFKTstudios @pixelvault_ @hunterorrell @tropoFarmer @Sarahj1919 But the PV drop alone is enough to convince me bloot is a good buy. 0.04 for a pixel vault NFT? Yes please. With potential added value in the future too
85,"@niftVR @TeamBloot @geniexyz @RTFKTstudios @pixelvault_ @hunterorrell @tropoFarmer @Sarahj1919 Yeah don’t think PV wants to go through with the drop really, but it’s happening since they promised like you said. 

The other founders of bloot are coming back to it now after the exit of beanie so I think there’s some potential of new things happening."
86,@Darcy35981260 @pixelvault_ 30 eth floor by the end of 2022?
87,@niftVR @TeamBloot @geniexyz @RTFKTstudios @pixelvault_ Yeah @pixelvault_ drop and drop from @hunterorrell and whatever @tropoFarmer and @Sarahj1919 builds. Mainly the PV drop but excited to see what Hunter is creating and now the community gets secondary sales so we can build something and get exposure from tropo

95,@dustmonkey_ 🔥🔥🔥
96,@itsmechase @pixelvault_ 🧠 I own two PVFD and will be looking to add more if I manage to do some awesome flips. Definitely an undervalued asset considering all the whitelist spots and free claims that you get
97,@LooksRareNFT @punkscomic @steven_schill @KingBlackBored @ape6743 @tropoFarmer @topshotswickie I'm looking for some Elite Ape Entry Coins. Check collection offers on LooksRare. I have a bid of 0.11
