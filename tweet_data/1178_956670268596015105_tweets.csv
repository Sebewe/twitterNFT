0,@OmerPeleg1 @tonal why not both?
1,"@MarkyDAO @tonal yes, was very easy

they weren't able (read willing) to put it on my first choice wall, because there is a sink / plumbing on the other side

so have at least one location where there is not plumbing like that

beyond that, was super easy"
2,"@anveshreddyj @tonal no, but i'm more interested in diverse strength training first than just one cardio exercise machine

may add something like that later, but idk, might decide i don't need it"
3,"@MarkyDAO @tonal they were slow with mine, got delayed a couple of times

if it doesn't ship on the week they said, i suggest contacting cust support immediately"
4,"@selkdoteth @tonal it is a finished space, but could go into any 7x7 ft space (needs to be professional hung on studs though, included in purchase price)"
5,@AltcoinDailyio 🍆🔥😭
6,"recently got one of these @tonal home gyms

so far, i'm digging it

no excuse not to use it (in my basement), and it can create an impressive amount of resistance (more than i'll likely need) &amp; lots of diff programs

anyone have experience with it / tips for using it long-term?"
7,"@Foobazzler i actually really enjoyed that game a lot

was flawed in many ways, but was very entertaining at the time"
8,"@Foobazzler nah, this guy was much more handsome https://t.co/UqUhC2qFel"

12,"@LorenBednar Brain Damage Helmet:

-20 INT
-10 DEX
+5 WILLPOWER
+20 STR
+50 CHARISMA"
13,but cock-eyed brain damage in RPG peasant starting rags can certainly be charming (i guess?) https://t.co/FmLrKjdVb4
14,@PunksAre i agree. the ostensible brain damage is actually cute
15,my bearish thesis on PixelMon Kevins is that people can always make uglier NFTs
16,"while its governance isn't perfect (imo, no on-chain governance is),

@MakerDAO has been a true leader in advancing how project governance can work, and has generally done it in a really professional way

other DAOs could learn a lot from them https://t.co/EDO3MFNeYj"
17,"@mattmmueller what would ""remaining passive"" have meant for them do you think?"
18,"@mattmmueller great, and now they're probably going to ""lose"" in every meaningful way

still great reasons?"
19,"personally, i am not interested in donating to parties who will use the funds for funding violence on either side

what are the best orgs to help real Ukrainian citizens (still in Ukraine or refugees)?

my go-to is typically the Red Cross"
20,"@un4w4r3 because his making a proclamation like that does not provide a just basis for war

though plenty of nations have been guilty of un-just reasons for declaring war, including the US

i think reality is Putin cannot ""win"" here in any real scenario"
21,"surprising # of Putin apologists on this site (maybe Russian bots? idk)

""Putin said red line of no missiles close to Russia and no Ukraine in EU/NATO, so now war""

ok, or maybe he's an addled old man with weak regime who has overplayed his hand and will eventually lose it all"
22,"👆 i just enjoy the bearish shit posting because there is WAY too much irrational moonboy shit in this space

i.e., get rich overnight type crap

been around long enough to understand that it's never that easy

better to have realistic expectations"
23,"guys, i've been holding spot for a long time

i've sold basically zero NFTs (&amp; i have a lot)

i have enough cash to survive for a while through a bad bear if it happens and then some (which i will use some of to buy a big pullback if it happens)

bUt i'M a glEeFul bEaR 🤪 https://t.co/lkgpIjtXYJ"
24,"@0xPhaed they're just shitposting, lol

almost all of my wealth is in crypto"
25,"my attention span has really gone to shit since going full-time into crypto about a year ago

starting one task, then getting distracted by 10 others

to be fair, have always been like this to some extent (i think a lot of tech-inclined people are), but seems way worse now"
26,@gjason0 @esentea @FloorDAO @JPEGd_69 zero?
27,"might just be cope, but i'm OK with just staying flat in spot with cash also and just letting the markets market from here"
28,@punk9059 @FloorDAO @JPEGd_69 will be a sort of lending (and income generating) protocol using NFTs as collateral assets. first asset will be CryptoPunks
29,"@esentea @FloorDAO @JPEGd_69 i am involved with a bunch, but of these, i'm a seed investor in jpeg'd

i have no affiliation with floordao, but i think it's cool"
30,"missed this earlier in the week, but public @zksync v2 testnet (EVM-compatible zk-rollup) is live! https://t.co/oVJpzbTZlo"
31,"big week for CryptoPunks (and soon more NFTs) with @FloorDAO and now @JPEGd_69 gearing up

what's next?"
32,"looking forward to more exhibitions on @______jpg______ 

some nice upgrades https://t.co/d3GAQ2EIOG"
33,"@Tunsky107 @discord it's fine if you are in like 2 servers with friends

then it becomes absolutely insane"
34,"never thought i'd say this, but using @discord for like 20 servers i actually want to participate in (but can't because the tools just aren't there and i'm not super human) is worse than using Outlook for corporate e-mail"
35,"@dollar_monopoly @aaronpenne i need to

im just so bad at discord"
36,"@Snips_eth @bitcoinpanda69 I’m obsessed with the channel now tbh

that was the first vid I watched by him"
37,@BrocDev well shit then
38,"@bitcoinpanda69 they actually use less water than washing by hand too in most cases

if you want to go down some real rabbit holes to learn more about how they work and why detergent tabs are a scam, watch this: https://t.co/ZeuGeC9ENh"
39,@aaronpenne has some Autoglyph hit to it 👀
40,is every oligarch trying to buy crypto right this minute or what?

43,@Crypto_Defi_Eth oh sweet summer child
44,"@punk4156 @all_candle true, and the mob cannot be coordinated, most of the moves seem like social censure

maybe ego-bruising to an addled mind, or maybe he’s just trying to figure out how to make it out at this point with his head intact"
45,"ok, real talk

was driving on I-95N today

saw a big green jeep with Ohio plates

NASA sticker back right

but back left was a black silhouette sticker

had to do a double-take, but the form was unmistakeable

it was a CryptoDickButt

so which one of you mf’ers was it?"
46,"@punk4156 @all_candle oh, I think a lot of moves here have been sloppy AF on US and NATO side, if we are talking about more than the black belt thing"
47,@punk4156 @all_candle *and Russia isn’t USSR
48,@punk4156 @all_candle Putin isn’t Khruschev
49,"@qkkel @0xFucks yes, as I said, probably 10-50 years"
50,"@all_candle @punk4156 idk, i think he has bigger problems than losing his black belt

catering to his ego for too long by too many has all possibly been part of the problem tbh"
51,"@troy_mcartor ya, Kevin prob ngmi"
52,@punk4156 i just hope they don’t cancel Russian Dressing
53,"@punk4156 what if their goal is not to attack his ego, but rather to make a statement on behalf of their own org?

personally, I think any kind of accreditation should be mostly neutral, but these orgs are hardly that sophisticated I imagine"
54,"memes matter, and memes can accrue value

how durable? depends on the meme

art quality is but one type of meme (stronger when coupled with derivative creative lineage and cultural relevance)

but sometimes silly cultural relevance alone can be enough (at least for a time) https://t.co/Urm7sAyDRB"
55,"@0xFucks @cobie it’s vague because no one knows

but def USD and Yuan, many Euro and others

current crypto networks are not liquid enough to sustain the economic needs of even one major nation (though they can be relevant in smaller ways as I mentioned in my follow on to my original post"
56,"@0xFucks but hey, i give 0 fucks what you think 😘"
57,"@0xFucks - don't need to be an engineer to understand that a payment system the US effectively controls will see alternatives given current geopolitical enviro
- i just shitpost about topics of interest to me, however, i have extensively studied poli sci and public policy (grad level)"
58,"@Krugman25 comfy chillin in spot and cash

no need to be a hero and try to long or short this crap without a clear trend break"
59,@hunterorrell @Apple @googlemaps with CarPlay it is hands down better imo
60,"@Xatarrer @LiveLambo sorry, I get hundreds of notis 

i don’t see most and further it’s not possible to respond to most"
61,@mdudas @Dictionarycom Clay Higgins down bad
62,@Xatarrer @LiveLambo ser I just shitpost for fun
63,"one outcome may have been Ukraine giving up the quest for EU and/or NATO membership in exchange for Russia standing down,

but clearly they’re not interested in offering Russia that form of appeasement, even under duress

self-determination https://t.co/gmFRy7jtv6"
64,@alexlowery do you benefit from any state services at all?
65,@ApedInCrypto @Apple @googlemaps i don’t do paid promos
66,"if you are a US citizen who had capital gains last year (2021) from crypto,

have you already set aside money for these obligations or will you have to sell crypto to pay them?"
67,"@AxieAur hope ur right!

risk enviro still looks like crap to me atm"
68,"@cryptonio123 probably not, unless there is a clear trend break

happy with my long-term holdings right now"
69,"i think we’ve hit a point where @Apple Maps is consistently better and more useful than @googlemaps 

never thought i’d see the day"
70,"if you are watching to see who follows unfollows you, then you need more hobbies

i’m sure people follow/unfollow me all of the time

i just generally don’t care enough to track

Twitter is a big place

unfollow today, follow back tomorrow, block, unblock

idc 😘"
71,"@Krugman25 Never played DS btw, played Jedi Fallen Order which I have been told is similar in style

i liked it, but also had to drop difficulty to one level above easy"
72,"@Krugman25 do you think it’s tractable for casual players?

am I just gonna be looking at the death screen the whole time?"
73,"👆 guys, this is just a shitpost

i still hold a ton of crypto if it rages up, but also cash/equivalents

but if you aren’t hedged at this point or don’t have an extremely low time preference on all of your holdings, then you probably have a death wish"
74,@ghostatlas3 tbh I think the oligarchs are smart enough to know that they cannot trust foreign authoritarian regimes
75,"got one of these messages too

it’s an interesting narrative, one that is way too simple

may eventually be the case, but one time capital flights aren’t the game

people globally waking up and realizing they need durable alternatives to trad banking will

that takes time https://t.co/PEOJaWj47c"
76,"@punksded_eth @DegenSpartan possible

eth2 pump, then people realize it doesn’t improve network performance much

issuance reduction will help tho

then eventual unlock of staked ETH and rewards will lead to a one time hell dump

that will prob be the buying opp of a century"
77,i am going to buy so much cheap crypto later this year
78,"@DegenSpartan got the same exact message yesterday

we def gonna dump tbh"
79,"i was thinking that if Putin has any dirt on American politicians,

he would for sure dump it to the media if he were ever forced to step down,

in an attempt to demonstrate his likely belief that liberal democracy is a hypocritical morass"
80,@DiscoverXnft we are all kevin
81,"@rleshner this whole incident will be remembered in the history books as ""The Putin Self-Own"""
82,@DegenSpartan what if i told you their bear market has not yet begun?
83,"@DegenSpartan i believe the term of art is ""mid"""
84,"@cobie i am not sure the next evolution will be hegemony

now we have mutually assured destruction from nukes too

we may reach a stable, truly multi-polar equilibrium

might F around and find out"
85,"plausible

floors provide a degree of fungibility (and potential liquidity depth) which higher echelons do not

this is why i think attractive floor pieces (which might actually be worth more than true floors) from desirable collections are the best risk-adjusted bet in NFTs https://t.co/0Sezf13Oar"
86,"@BTCislandboy @cobie that's possible

more than that many have gold

it still doesn't mean that there will be enough liquidity/depth to support full global economic interaction

so why they have it and how they use it will matter"
87,"as long as debt exists, nation-state fiat currencies will exist

and so for as long as nation-states exist, you can be damned sure fiat currencies will exist

imagining otherwise is delusion"
88,"@dfi any platform which censors activity is going to invite alternatives from people/nation-states afraid of being censored

the decision to denominate activity in USD has been one that has been forced on many of them (petrodollar)

reality is that will start to change"
89,"@cobie to be clear, i think crypto could play a significant role in ""micro"" conflicts even now

but i don't see it having an effect on macro flows between nation-states anytime soon"
90,"@cobie we fragment into multiple global currency networks, still centered mostly around fiat

over time (likely decades), maybe crypto gains enough liquidity to become a true geopolitical factor,

but no way governments throw into the towel and go onto ""crypto standard."" fiat remains"
91,"yup 💯🎯 + Lindy Effect

and if you sell your CryptoPunks during a bear, you probably gonna regret it real bad in &lt;5 years https://t.co/pEz6fT8w7O"
92,"@0xfoobar there is so much misallocated capital in the US economy right now

just insane

all because we won't do the necessary credit reset"
93,"@0xfoobar it was a good run for the US, being able to pull this off without the entire world rebelling

i think this form of economic imperialism is just a lot harder for most to understand

but yah, it's unquestionably created rot

first step to clearing it out is let risk assets burn"
94,"@alohacowboysol reality is a lot of higher end NFTs will end up in DAO collateral vaults

they are simply TOO GOOD at being censorship-resistant collateral, and perhaps confer ineffable ""culture power"" (as a tradeoff for liquidity depth)

making the ones collected by individuals even more scarce"
95,"do you guys see what is happening here?

CryptoPunks are getting financialized 👀 https://t.co/m6CvaiQNWt"
96,"@0xfoobar yah, USD sorta F'ed now

though not in a ""go to zero"" kind of way

more like a ""bleed marketshare which was almost 100% before to a new smaller majority or plurality""

though i still won't bet against American innovation to keep us ahead of currency debasement

we'll see"
97,"@NateAlexNFT lol, well, they right that some funds def need to go kablooey at this point

good times lasted for too long i reckon,

but i reckon i been wrong before too"
98,"@GKoz2 USD not gonna go to zero in any event,

but they're not holding it only for its SoV value

they're holding it for potential control/insurance"
99,"@NateAlexNFT i dunno how to think about all of the derivatives yet for digital art

i think one day, we may look at them like remixes of a song

and some people will see/hear the derivative, and not even realize every beat on the radio is from the 70s and 80s"
