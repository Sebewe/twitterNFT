20,"With all that said, I like the Pets and can’t wait to quest! Hopefully they can set the standard here with p2e gaming."
21,"I don’t see this as good or bad, it just is. And it’s important to take these things into account when transacting. For something to be considered a ‘blue chip’, it must perform like one with a provable track record. A consistent delivery of value to the community without fault."
22,"Not at all hating on @coolcatsnft, but this is an insight into their operations as a project and their competency with launching things moving forward. I believe they can bounce back from this and have prolonged success, but they must learn from this experience and improve."
23,"For example, @pixelvault_ have proven time and time again their experience and capability to smoothly launch a number of different things within their ecosystem, from mints to staking to giveaways and much more. There are other projects out there that have also proven themselves."
24,"Still very excited to evolve my Cool Pet, but can’t ignore the bumpy launch this has been by @coolcatsnft. It’s a time to deploy patience, as I’m sure once the game is up and running this will soon be forgotten. It does however highlight the extreme value of good operators."

53,I’m a fan of the growing community at @MoonlingsNFT. The first approved derivative project of @MetaHero_ and created by members of the @pixelvault_ Founder’s Dao.

57,"In addition, being ‘early’ doesn’t guarantee up only from here. I feel like people know this and generally understand things could go to zero before wider spread adoption. But at the same time, I also don’t know if many people really are prepared for all of this to go to zero 🤷🏼‍♂️"
58,"I keep seeing the term ‘We’re early’ get thrown around with misleading connotations. Yes, we are early. But do not confuse being ‘early’ with automatic financial gain in the future. This space is dog eat dog. Your gain is at someone else’s expense. Do not forget this."
59,"@coolcatsnft Rest up and look after yourselves, I’m sure it has been a full on past couple of days. Rarely do things work perfectly in this space, hence the importance of having patience. I’m still excited to claim on Monday! LFG"
60,"@crypto_broc @zentensivist @Bocker_backer @pixelvault_ With $pow being the in game currency, I just feel it would be better in the hands of participants in the game rather than sitting in a vault? Or maybe holding long term in a vault is a better play financially. Tough decision we as a DAO we probably have to make together."
61,@crypto_broc @zentensivist @Bocker_backer @pixelvault_ Yeah I think it gets very complex with so many things that the DAO owns. Putting planets/sidekicks/staking for $pow aside seperate from everything else… would there be a away to distribute that $pow evenly on a regular basis?
62,@zentensivist @Bocker_backer @pixelvault_ Yeah wow hadn’t thought much about the unclaimed planet allocation and the implications of that with claiming sidekicks and staking for $pow. It all sounds great but I wonder how that value transfers to holders of FD? Maybe gets priced in to the potential $pv token?

70,"@Guts2112 Yes, definitely highlights the benefit of holding a cat. Pets can complete a max of 10 quests a day, so there’s a potential to earn 10x a combination of those $MILK rewards shown above. Still hard to compare to the passive yield cats generate."
71,"Cool Pets are going to be an exciting new phase of @coolcatsnft and I'm grateful to be apart of it!
There's a lot more info available at https://t.co/B5R685SCTF if you're still interested. Peace out ✌️"
72,"If you're too busy to complete Quests, you can stake your Pet any time from day 1 in the Adventures Guild. You can't complete Quests while Pets are staked, but you can still interact with them with items. The amount of $MILK earned via staking will be less than completing Quests."
73,"There are different types of Quests with different rarities, ranging from Common to Legendary. Below shows the amount of $MILK that can be earned upon completion of each type of Quest. https://t.co/7MviCxL8cw"
74,"There are 2 main ways to acquire $MILK as a Cool Pet owner: Complete Quests or stake your Pet in the Adventures Guild. 

Quests are adventures your Pet can go on to earn $MILK for items. There is a limit of 10 Quests per day that your Pet can complete."
75,Not all items are the same... each item has it own 'mood' which will affect your Pets affinity to each of the elements. Not all items are equal either... some will have a greater effect on your Pets elemental affinities than others. Some even impact multiple elements.
76,"Below are the number of interactions that your Pet needs to have to evolve to the next stage. There is a limit of 5 items that a Pet can interact with each day. 
Therefore, Final Form = 10 days minimum. https://t.co/Lr5IgAmxlS"
77,"There are four stages in the evolution of your Pet: 
Egg -&gt; Hatching -&gt; Hatched -&gt; Final Form https://t.co/dx9TpVeCvg"
78,"Your Pet is minted as an unhatched egg, and the best part is YOU get to determine the final form of your Pet! Growing your Pet involves buying items for your Pet to play with or consume. These items are purchased from the Cool Shop with $MILK. https://t.co/2QnWLm86Pe"
