83,"10/10 Skating and streetwear are sources of inspiration. People like how skaters do whatever they want and kinda break the rules. Similarly, what Azuki is doing in Web3 is like the skater of the internet. They are exuding the culture and translating it into their own brand."
84,9/10 Most projects start with a project and end with just that. Azuki is building a brand - a Web3 version of Disney- and creating IP that people love and building businesses around it. Decentralized IP will be the core concept that they're heading towards. #web3 #Disney
85,"8/10 One fascinating fact is that not many PFP in the space right now has a red background. Using a strong color like red🟥(usually represents energy, passion and excitement) really sets them apart from others."
86,"7/10 Also, the team initiated their own algorithm ERC721A to reduce fee minting multiple NFTs and shared with the community for broader contribution and improvement -&gt; great initiative for other projects to follow and execute their own💫."
87,"6/10 The team will provide the guard rails, The Garden (the infrastructure) and Azuki members will help them build the rest (the ecosystem)💪."
88,"5/10 Anime-inspired art is like a hook 🪝. Once you become the character and join The Garden, you'll feel like you have the responsibility to support everyone around in their journey to Web3. Everyone is a contributor to Azuki's growth."
89,"4/10 Taking the 🅱️ean means you peel back the layers and will be more educated on DeFi, Web3, DAOs and anything crypto."
90,"3/10 Red 🅱️ean is used to symbolize the movement from Web2 to Web3 where ownership is in the hand of the users. It references The Matrix in the sense that once you take it, you're more woke to what Web3 is all about (technology &gt; flipping JPEGS)."
91,2/10 It all starts with Red🅱️eans. A concept of planting the beans in the garden and sprouting them together. Azuki is about the community having ownership in the brand together.
92,"Here are some takeaways from a great ep.92 from @ohhshiny show (encourage everyone to listen)

1/10 Due to the nature of the open-source code, there've been lots of copycat NFT projects being produced. What makes Azuki stand out is the narrative and lore developed around it."
