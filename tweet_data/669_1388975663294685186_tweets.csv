3,"Ok so update — I am now including gas txn on purchase and gas txn on sale as cost basis in net gains, but omitting gas fees for lower/cancel sales…

I can get the buy and sale gas txn easy, but gas associated with stuff other than buy/sell is a killer."
12,"US NFT tax question — are you all deducting gas? My advisor is saying I can only deduct gas for sale txns, but not for any other txns.
