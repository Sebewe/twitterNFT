10,"@trista_eth @plutoniumfitzg @richerd Some projects yes, others no. There are many quality pfp projects with great art, but there’s also a lot of low effort crap. It’ll all sort itself out in time."
11,@plutoniumfitzg @richerd The pfp speculative mania will die down in time. It isn’t sustainable. Many chasing profits will over invest and be left holding the bag. Quality art will appreciate over time. Now is a great time to collect amazing work if you have the capital available.
12,"@richerd I agree. There are many pfp projects that are overvalued and there’s an abundance of high quality art that’s undervalued. This space is rife with speculation, I don’t think pfp mania is sustainable. I think quality artists will be rewarded as the market matures. Time will tell."
13,"@richerd Do you feel that way yourself, or is that your observation regarding nft collectors in general?"
