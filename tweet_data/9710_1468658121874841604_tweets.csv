9,@micahletts @emilf_eth @coldpizza_eth It doesn’t even matter because the election was corrupt anyways. It’s all about control in our government and with that mindset we will get nowhere. That’s all
10,"@micahletts @emilf_eth @coldpizza_eth Obviously Russia coordinated the plan, they’re not fools. Trump literally congratulated Putin for his actions so I do believe it would be the same scenario with Trump. Now the extent of how bad the situation gets is definitely something that could be argued. All speculation tho."
11,@emilf_eth @coldpizza_eth Lmaoooo wake up man. Our political system AS A WHOLE is weak and this would be happening if Trump were president as well.
12,@metacoltt @nftfren @coldpizza_eth News flash but this would be happening if Trump were president as well. It’s our political system as a whole that looks weak.

54,@james_meiners @unknownnn_69 @_masoncrowe @fishyfamNFT It isn’t about that. It’s about how unprepared the fishy fam team were for this mint and the lack of awareness they had. The exploitation was a CompSci101 type mistake by the dev. It’s really not excusable in a business. But diff space so they will be off the hook
55,@MorieMoriemori3 @JAMPZER @StonedBagNFT @fishyfamNFT They will be fine as long as they don’t rug. Similar thing happened to Rengoku

90,@saba12_ @RichMavs77 @ayanes95 The weather excuse could have gone both ways. There were multiple horrible throws that Tua made that were straight up dropped by the Titans’ defense for INTs. His decision making is the most worrisome for me. Saw it against the Jets as well.
