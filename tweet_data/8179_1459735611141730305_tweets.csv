1,"@theweb3god @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Do you believe there should be a globally recognized naming standard for the internet?

If not, I've got some bad news for your domains"
2,"@theweb3god @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains It's undoubtedly ""easier"" because you're paying for static NFTs generated by a for-profit company with UD.. of course it's cheaper, the names are worthless and not backed by anything real

You pay to participate in the decentralized naming standard of web3"

12,@avsa maybe we would want to lock ourselves with an oracle if it was built with the same security and structural integrity in which the underlying technology is based
13,"RT @avsa: ENS is a complex system made of multiple contracts (I found 16 so far). This ensures we can freeze some parts and update others,…"
14,"@Jamie_ethnft @adamhunt__ @wallamolla @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Would you like me to retract my previous statement so you don't get too caught up in focusing on this one specific detail?

I'll reword it for you, ok?

ENS has positioned themselves into the highest probability of obtaining the .eth DNS extension for the reasons stated above"
15,"@adamhunt__ @Jamie_ethnft @wallamolla @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains If you can't reliably read the words of a wiki I cannot expect you to read my own, but I'll give it a try because some people need it

Ethiopia is in possession of the .eth extension - ccTLDs require countries a maximum of 2 characters making .eth unused but officially registered"
16,"@Jamie_ethnft @adamhunt__ @wallamolla @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains https://t.co/LpS5ChCxz4

Here you go"
17,"@adamhunt__ @wallamolla @Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Let's say, hypothetically just as a thought experiment, that UD decided to use their framework &amp; issue their own .eth TLD on behalf of UD's name

Who would then be officially recognized as the real .eth?

Being recognized as the standard is very important else you convolute all"
18,@adamhunt__ @wallamolla @Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains To my knowledge the leading development team has not only been in negotiations with ICANN in regards of potentially securing the .eth TLD but have also positioned themselves beautifully into actually acquiring it as Ethiopia is not capable of utilizing it
19,"@adamhunt__ @wallamolla @Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains It's hard to fit all of that into one tweet, I apologize

The idea is simple: ENS is standing by .eth and only .eth for the foreseeable future as a staple of their protocol

The official DNS TLD is unused and so this gives ENS the highest likelihood of obtaining the eth extension"
20,@adamhunt__ @wallamolla @Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Because ENS limits itself to .eth TLDs and .eth is currently not being utilized by the country in which it is reserved (the TLD of countries are required to be 2 characters in length &amp; .eth is 3) making ENS the most likely naming service to actually integrate directly with DNS
21,"RT @Brommhill: @Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains ""I actually think it's a good thing that all of the premium .com na…"
22,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains ""I actually think it's a good thing that all of the premium .com names were taken in the 90s never to be utilized again""

That's the argument of UD supporters who think domains shouldn't expire btw"
23,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains lol only ENS has issues and not UD? If that's the argument maybe we shouldn't be having this discussion

Renewal fees aren't a bug, it's a feature that ensures the sustainability of the protocol

Imagine if DNS domains never expired and premiums were locked forever lmao"
24,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains To be fair I don't believe you should be buying ""premium"" UD names even if you could afford it

They're static NFTs not backed by anything and the more TLDs they issue the more likely they are to have their names compromised should DNS decide to issue them

$100k UD premiums lmao"
25,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains You can apply that argument to virtually anything if you try hard enough and at this point I'm not sure it warrants a response

It's not my job to convince you, the market is doing a fantastic job of speaking on my behalf

Best of luck fren"
26,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains I hope you haven't invested too much money into UD NFTs fren

You can keep trying to throw some gotchas my way but.. please point me to the direction of any recent large sales that compare even the slightest to ENS and I would greatly appreciate it

It's a protocol, not a company"
27,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains In case you needed some more clarification, they directly mention a ""DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY STANDARD"" - not a centralized static-NFT issuing company with better marketing"
28,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains https://t.co/2LAZbNcyWs

Any more questions?"
29,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Sure, but they haven't acknowledged UD as the decentralized identity standard to my knowledge the way in which they did ENS

Have you seen any large UD sales lately the way ENS has had recently? Maybe if you want to spend $100k for a ""premium"" name directly from their website lol"
30,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Coinbase &amp; Chainlink being the primary two, yes

Checkout all of the subdomains that data.eth has issued it's a pretty fun rabbit hole to go down"
31,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Right, you can break that down a lot easier by saying UD is a centralized NFT issuer with no long-term sustainability other than new names (all premiums lost forever) and ENS is an actual decentralized naming protocol

You're right, they function differently"
32,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Brantly is gone from the non-profit company leading the development of ENS, not ENS itself

Distinctions are pretty important!"
33,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Ethiopia is the current placeholder of the TLD .eth there is no doubt about it

However, the extension largely goes unused for various reasons &amp; ENS is largely recognized and issuing no other TLD's

The math is pretty simple to workout when you have industry leaders pushing ENS"
34,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains All I can do is direct you to the word of the DAO - that's what it means to have a truly decentralized protocol, there is no one individual running the show

Domains need to expire if you want there to be any semblance of a naming protocol to have any longevity

I promise you"
35,"@DomainIncite @Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Do you believe that the global naming space should be fractionalized? I sure don't and I don't believe you should either

Why do you think ENS hasn't issued more TLD's than .eth the way so many other naming ""companies"" have?

DNS isn't going away - some food for thought"
36,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Sorry I'm not understanding what you are trying to say here

So your complaint isn't with ENS itself, but the very decentralized model in which it and everything else is built upon to begin with? 

You might have to get in touch with the Bitcoin CEO about that one"
37,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains You seem to be making comparisons in a quite whimsical manner

How is ENS not innovating? More so, what steps is UD taking in your opinion to separate itself from the crowd?

At least it's well understood that ENS is the king, glad we can agree on that"
38,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains The distinction is pretty easily understood

UD is a centralized entity that sells domains they themselves have minted for a premium - it's their business model

ENS is a protocol that needs verly little human intervention to continue operating smoothly long into the future"
39,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Who is the ""I"" in letting you keep it? It's a decentralized smart contract

If you trust the nature of virtually any popularized smart contract you should have no problem trusting ENS as the code has been properly and thoroughly audited

UD is just another NFT; not a protocol"
40,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Because of this you are able to receive funds from virtually any and all blockchains as you can simply update those text-records to match whatever public address you would like to share

Did you know that ENS has a feature being released shortly called CCIP-read? Do some reading"
41,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Couldn't agree more with this point

Web3 won't just be Ethereum based, but that's largely what it is referred to at the moment

Did you know that ENS is effectively a decentralized phonebook? You can update your text-records to point to anything you want on an immutable ledger"
42,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Because it's done in a decentralized way and this requires fees

For the sustainability and longevity of this decentralized naming ecosystem requires fees and a working name economy e.g. expiries

You own UD outright - but it's just another NFT

ENS is the naming standard of web3"
43,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Nope, of course leasing something under that lens is never better than outright ownership

But it's different with ENS; it is outright ownership - there is nobody in the world that can take your domains from you if you participate in the @ensdomains economy and pay your fees"
44,"@Jamie_ethnft @matthewegould @unstoppableweb @ensdomains Thanks for taking the time to reply

Curious what you mean by UD having a better future in web space? If you weren't aware, ENS is recognized by ICANN whereas UD to my knowledge is not

In the future if an extension like .crypto or .nft is adopted by DNS.. what then?"

That's a hot-take"
92,"@ptonerdoteth Do you know how funds are sent to a mooncat? Does your mooncat store text records? Are those records controlled by a centralized entity? How would I send funds to a cat?

Did you know that ENS subdomains don't have yearly renewal fees? They might be of more interest for you"
93,@ptonerdoteth Can I set text records or send payment's from any blockchain to your cute pixelated picture of a guy wearing a hat?
94,"@ptonerdoteth Sure, how many more metaphors and analogies would you like to be appeased?

You pay to participate in the premier decentralized naming standard of web3 - a true naming economy

Not for static jpegs that only boast speculative value

Confused about anything else? I'll be here"
95,"@ptonerdoteth I like a lot of static NFTs, it doesn't mean they have inherent value the way a decentralized naming protocol does

Some people like off-brand Cola"
96,"@ptonerdoteth We definitely run out of premium words, and when the majority of those premium name's are subsequently lost forever as they were all minted by early adopters and or just sold for a premium by the service who created them...

Well now you don't have a naming economy, just NFTs"
97,"@ptonerdoteth As a consumer of premium Netflix entertainment I do not like paying monthly payments, why would I?"
