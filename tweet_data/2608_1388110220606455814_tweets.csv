22,"@HowManyMiles_ Thank you! And yes, as stated and credited in the collection’s description: “Inspired by the amazing artwork and stories of Bunny Suicides by Andy Riley.”. I’ve always been a big fan, and it’s what inspired me to make these. ❤️🐹"

30,@doodles It’s. So. Pretty!!!!!! 🐹
31,RT @incognito_eth: @TurtleTownNFT @opensea Tie between the @vvelvetbunnyy 1/1 and the @HamsterNFT Collab! https://t.co/TF3qd0P6BR
32,@vingoslang Whatever you like.
33,"@WGMInterfaces Respect. And take care. Health, family and friends it’s what ALWAYS should come first. ❤️🐹"
34,@HashBastardsNFT @coolcatsnft @Ghxsts @nftworldsNFT @alienfrens @sartoshi_nft @CoolmanUniverse @BossBeautiesNFT This one made me giggle. You’re not the only one that feels like that. https://t.co/QJavofUpGd
35,@Bagflip12 @flavswrld @Cosmodinos @DumpsterDorks Thank you!
36,@Bagflip12 @flavswrld @Cosmodinos @DumpsterDorks Cosmodinos…. “Quality” in the same sentence. Ok. https://t.co/Gybfoz1Abf
37,"@Bagflip12 @flavswrld @Cosmodinos @DumpsterDorks I was simply just “surprised” to read a “low effort” comment on Floppy’s. Sure, it’s not for everyone, but it’s DEFINITELY not low effort."
38,@Bagflip12 @flavswrld @Cosmodinos @DumpsterDorks Sorry. I only invested 1% of my portfolio into Floppy’s so far. 😅
39,@Bagflip12 @flavswrld Added another reply to rectify that!
40,"@Bagflip12 @flavswrld But sure, if you prefer low-effort art such as Alien Frens and Coolman’s (which are essentially more meme-focused NFT pieces). Sure. It’s a personal opinion anyways. But saying it’s “low-effort” art wise. That’s just wrong. 🐹"
41,"@Bagflip12 @flavswrld Lol, what? But, you’re wearing a Coolman’s piece. 👀"
42,@tradingrub @0xmoxxa Love Floppys
43,"It was definitely overlooked with releases such as Invisible Friends, Starcatchers, 3Landers, Karafuru, Beans, Wonderpals, Howlerz, Dented Feels, Weather Report, Pixelmon. And more diamond handed collectors will get aboard sooner or later. NFA, DYOR. 🐹"
44,@KatsukatH Exactly. All of the above. 🐹
45,@Tokinottoki ❤️
46,"Within the Hammys community we also have our own Alpha/Sweep &amp; Wallet-tracker channels for holders. Personally, I love to find these 'hidden' raw 💎 projects that are overlooked cause of the saturated NFT Market we're in right now. Floppys is one of those raw 💎's!
