0,@LithDolina @WaltonMCR Been listening my @Bandcamp download of this fucking PHENOMENAL album by @WaltonMCR for the past few days since it released and can't wait for the vinyl to arrive. @AD93rec never fails to impress and I'm really looking forward to more @LithDolina sub-label releases.

2,"@Nicolas_Sassoon Thank you, Nicolas!"

5,"@LoJamMusic @ghostly Wow, this is extraordinarily good. I just listened to the previews on @Junorecords and I'm in awe of this album. Can't wait for April 8th, a shame it's so far away!"

12,"@NinaForPLACE Here's a classic example. Bokeh is basically out-of-focus light points captured when shooting with a shallow depth of field. It can look stunning in nature shots and city shots, especially when raining...

47,@GaydarovIgor I also vote for color. It enhances the warmer tones of the subject and contrasts beautifully with the cooler tones of the background.  That contrast is somewhat lost in the sepia version.
48,"I just adopted a new cat... Samurai Cat #1708! Thank you, @samuraicats_nft and @CNgang_nft.

54,@arrington I’ve been wondering about this myself for a while now. I feel very conflicted as a diehard crypto investor (for nearly a decade) who has deep respect for NNT’s body of work. Clearly he has an agenda.
