If we say we want to help &amp; make an impact, bringing autism acceptance into the space, then we must listen to those around us. You will notice the puzzle pieces will no longer be used but will be replaced with beautiful infinity symbols."

I’m a father to a young child who was diagnosed a few years ago with autism. Since that day I have learned a great deal, not only about my dear son but myself as well. Since joining the NFT space I have also learned a great deal from adults that are on the autism spectrum."
