55,"From my still relevant video about DeFi ⬇️
https://t.co/8hp2LK6Qvl"
56,"The exact details might still be quite vague, but the future of the whole DeFi space is brighter than ever. DeFi is here to stay. We may not be 100% sure of its final form, but it is almost certainly the future of finance."
57,"with the most adopted and hopefully most decentralized working solution.

And even though some people may not like it, this is the beauty of DeFi and any other open ecosystems like this."
58,DeFi on Ethereum with different Layer 2 options and sidechains; DeFi and CeDeFi on other chains; interoperability between blockchains or maybe something completely new: It’s almost guaranteed that all of this will be tried and after some time we’re going to end up ...
59,What we can pretty much assume though is that every single potential solution will be explored. Some of them will survive and thrive while others will become irrelevant over time.
60,"Although it seems like DeFi is at a crossroad, in practice we’re just experiencing an ongoing Cambrian Explosion of this nascent space. 

The truth is, that at this point, no one can be certain what the future of DeFi will look like.
