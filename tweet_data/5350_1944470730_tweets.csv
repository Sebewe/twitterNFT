1,"What would the NFT icon look like?

We all know when we see a bell icon it's for notifications or an envelope for messages, but what would be the NFT icon?

So, designers, let's see your suggestions

7,"Hey #NFTCommunity, there's no 0xPolygon2 only @0xPolygon

Scammers are everywhere and constantly looking for an easy pray. Always double check everything and remember, Polygon and other projects and companies will hardly send you message first and out of nowhere. Be safe 🙏 https://t.co/iFjpLeTMA4"
8,"@utverzhdai Just guessing, not sure if foundation supports any of layer 2 or scaling solutions like Polygon, Avalanche, etc... Transactions are really, really cheap there 🤷🏻‍♂️"
9,@utverzhdai L2 maybe?
10,@droptpackets @RobynMarieHill Maybe lack of competitors made them think they are irreplaceable. So it's good for everyone that the competition is growing. Those who think they are irreplaceable will soon be replaced by others who listen and pay attention. Who knows 🤷‍♂️
11,"@Tuna_Worldwide All makes sense, thanks. I remember that scandal, but if that was true, they are not to be blame for the actions of that individual. Right? They weren't involved as a company in such a bad practice, when they found out, they fired responsible person. That's just my reasoning."
12,@Theo_Fandto I can really relate with what you said. Thanks
13,"@danielgothits All valid. Thanks Daniel. And what about Rarible? We had Rarible for some time as alternative, they have token, but people didn't recognise them as OpenSea killer"
14,@RobynMarieHill Really good point. Thanks. They do seem like they're more about making money then they are about making the best thing ever
15,"@1Bprice Still learning every day brother, but I don't understand the question. Opensea not equal NFT"
16,"@thebankofeth They also must be experiencing extremely high volume of traffic, and it must be hard to keep track everything. But on the other hand, they should have enough resources to address such problems, and they should care about their users and reputation more."
17,"@thebankofeth Hm, then that's more appropriate name 😄 btw, I can see why such things can happen. I mean, NFT market is oversatureted currently. I have a feeling like there are 100 new projects every day."
18,"You all hate Opensea just because they didn't create thier own token and give them away to you, or there are also other reasons that make more sense? #opensea #LooksRare $looks 

P.S. not being sarcastic or defending OS, it's a genuine question. Want to know why people dislike OS"
19,@mediagoblin1 Or Discord acquired Twitter 😂
20,"@mediagoblin1 Thanks @mediagoblin1, and what if twitter and discord were integrated in the same platform/place?"
21,"@NateAlexNFT @doodles Wanted them since the project was announced, but didn't make it to the whitelist. Tried to buy during public minting but I was defeated in gas war (gas price were 5-6k). Cool project, turned out not to be so cool, and that's the problem with almost every project, elitism"
22,"@NateAlexNFT I think we would see a lot more cowards if you haven't put that ""deaths next round"" data on the page 🤷‍♂️"
23,"Hey #NFT projects, how happy are you with Twitter and Discord for community building or as community platforms? #NFTCommumity"

Well, you can also go to Louvre, take a picture of Mona Lisa painting, print it and hang it on your wall.

Does that makes original Mona Lisa displayed in the museum bullshit? I don't think so.
