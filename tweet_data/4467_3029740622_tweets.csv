42,"4/ Even though we exist in a web3 world, we still need to think about web1/2 risks.

Be safe out there and stay vigilant and sceptical!"
43,"3/ Even though there are certain protocols to help mitigate spoofing (SPF/DMARC/DKIM), it is generally easy to spoof a sender address and is not something to trust.

In this example, the sender domain should have been ""@opensea.io"" https://t.co/gx6R7QyE9n"
44,"2/ ALWAYS check the sender address - an incorrect domain is a positive indicator of a malicious actor. 

In saying that, it's very important to understand that the opposite is NOT TRUE - a correct sender address is NOT a negative indicator of a malicious actor. https://t.co/plVpKFS3cX"
45,"1/ Malicious actors are consistent in delivering these attacks via methods with a matter of urgency. 

This urgency catches people off guard and works in the exact same way that FOMO works - this urgency makes people think illogically and with less scepticism. https://t.co/1wYufoaZh8"

83,@JRNYcrypto https://t.co/OvciCPTpYQ
84,"@hchase17 @0xJoss @AstonDreamz @NFTethics @WeatheReportNFT @SadBotsNFT Agreed. The questions themselves are harmless and very much appropriate, but the approach (in a public forum right before mint) is unethical IMO."
85,@Shiggidy_Listic Your seed phrase. It has the keys to an infinite number of vaults/wallets.
86,"@Shiggidy_Listic No probs mate! Just keep in mind that this one control (authority revocation) doesn't mitigate all risks. 

This control mitigates a particular risk - someone within the company stealing a Pokemon card (or many) from your vault.

Someone can still rob the bank."
87,"@Shiggidy_Listic Think of it like this - you told your bank that a specific company has delegated authority to do anything with your Pokemon card collection in your vault. They can come and go as they please.

Revoking the contract is calling the bank and revoking that delegated authority."
88,"@GinaHelms3 We are working on a solution. Unfortunately it's not as easy as an additional field on a form, that does not allow us to verify that the person filling out the form owns both wallets."
89,"@cryptorooki3 @punk6529 The current situation isn't perfect, and we are working on a solution to allow verifying your pass on a different address to your mint address.

For now, I would keep it in the third level between Selling and Vault. The projects that you are minting from us aren't that degen."
90,@punk6529 @0xFrame @opensea @LooksRareNFT Good to hear you're trying it out mate. I'd be highly surprised if you go back to Metamask
91,@punk6529 I think there should be one extra layer between Selling and Vault. For high value items that you actually require chain interaction with trustworthy contracts - eg claiming your Gen Kong's nanas.
92,"I think there should be one extra layer between Selling and Vault. For high value items that you actually require chain interaction with trustworthy contracts - eg claiming your Gen Kong's nanas.

95,@0xJoss @AstonDreamz @NFTethics @WeatheReportNFT Did you see the @SadBotsNFT post? They did respond and they responded well. They damage was already done though. It's unethical to call a project a scam off a hunch.
96,@starism001 The communities that I have been a part of are definitely not as you describe. But YMMV
97,"@ImliterallyETH Really sorry to hear that you are being harassed when web3 should be about community and helping each other. This sort of behaviour is unacceptable and I commend you for not calling them out publicly, even though I think it's your best course of action. 
Keep your head held high"
98,@QuinlinJones @OttoSuwenNFT That's almost exactly what we are working on. 👍
99,@QuinlinJones @OttoSuwenNFT That's one level below Premint's use case. Premint is a raffle tool for WL spots - you connect Discord and wallet to go in a WL draw for a project. Then that list of IDs/wallets gets sent to the project to load into their WL.
