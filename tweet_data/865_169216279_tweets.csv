21,"I'm very empathetic and have a ton of respect for content creators in niche categories. 

the determination to continue to own your space, believe in the topics, and foster a community is not easy."
22,@FrankieDTankie Don’t believe it’s essential to the individuals — believe it’s essential for the technology.
23,"hiding behind a digital identity in web3 is very “endemic.”

however, in order for this industry to scale, I truly believe we need to see IRL faces. 

I fundamentally don’t agree with 💯% anonymous identities. Risk v reward for consumers is too high to trust an invisible person."

25,"people are buying CARS without ever driving them. 

people are buying HOUSES without ever stepping foot in them — HOUSES!! Lol 

before you snarl or say “no chance” at new technology, don’t judge todays UX product. Judge the advantage this tech provides the human behavior."
26,"if there’s a technological advantage that makes your product or service more efficient for the business and the end consumer, over time it will eventually win.

look at the items that we’re buying online these days! Early e-commerce predicted it, and many industries laughed."
27,"by predicting that every non fungible asset will become an NFT, I receive many sarcastic responses “yeah, okayyy.”

I can’t help but think it was the same response predicting that every company would have a website — or predicting every company would have a social media account."

68,"I still love non-blockchain games and non-blockchain business strategies.

I talk so much about web3 to hopefully inspire the establishment to think BIGGER and BROADER.

Think about a gamers lifestyle holistically — not just their activity or hobby of gaming. Take a risk."
