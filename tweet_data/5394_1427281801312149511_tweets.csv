It’s an alternative for moving money, but it’s not nearly as practical as some would lead you to believe."

7,"Props to the sellers though. I’d sell the most hyped project on this planet if you gave me an immediate 60x return on it. 

The buyers though? Y’all are crazy."
8,"You have to BELIEVE in a project to miss out on a mint for .25 ETH and then turn around and pay 14.99 ETH for it before reveal. 

Some of y’all have so much money you don’t have a damn clue what to do with it."
9,"Dumb question:

If I revoked approvals over the weekend, but didn’t cancel listings, then I need to cancel that listing and relist it in order for an NFT to sell, correct?"

Also, @MaxonBollocks is seriously being slept on."
14,@DataNFT_ I’d jump in for sure.
15,"Honestly, the Fed should go ahead and raise the interest rate to a .5%, accept the incoming crash and be more hawkish later in the year to aid recovery. 

We’re heading toward a global crash anyway. Just get it over with and start rebuilding."
16,"@DataNFT_ Potential. 

It’s nothing yet. But it *could* be. It’s like the internet in the early days. We’re all trying to figure out its place, and many projects will fail but some will become HUGE. 

I know that sounds very @garyvee’ish, but I think he’s 100% right on it."
17,"@NFTsAnonymous I also think we forget about the power of what folks have vs. what folks don’t and how that influences adoption. 

Kids will get the most out of this at first, then adults, and then everyone. If you don’t feel like the target market, think about who is and how they drive culture."
18,"@NFTsAnonymous Some of it really is. No doubt. 

However, go screw around with an Oculus for a short amount of time and you’ll see the potential for this. My wife got me one for my birthday and it’s WAY more fun than I would’ve thought. 

Once you put the headset on, the game changes."

24,"@maddintheman @i64StudioNFTs @opensea @artiface I wouldn’t take it too personal bro. Honestly, there’s so much bad info out there that even those folks trying to help may be taken out of context. 

At the very least, now he knows you were helping. So the ultimate goal was achieved."
25,"@maddintheman @i64StudioNFTs @opensea I’m not going to pretend to know how any of this works, but Wyvern is indeed the backbone of OpenSea’s sales."
26,"@maddintheman @i64StudioNFTs @opensea Bryan is right. This is directly from OpenSea’s site (you can go to their homepage and scroll down and see it for yourself). 

The new contract is a Wyvern contract. That’s why the hack is so confusing. If you’re going to list on OS, you will use Wyvern. https://t.co/9G8rVVpizv"
27,"I’m going to give @SuperlativeSS a chance to respond back to my support ticket. I don’t want to say I’m done with the project. 

However, if I can’t get any feedback and explanation, then I’ll sell this shit in a heartbeat &amp; I encourage y’all not to buy it from me or anyone else."
28,"It’s incredibly unprofessional. 

It’s one thing to make a mistake and, I guess, have your discord hacked and people get affected by that from clicking bad links in the server. 

But you have to own that shit. Don’t silence your supporters because they’re asking questions."
29,"I understand that there are a lot of people who probably were asking the same questions as me. Yet, there’s no announcement regarding who’s been affected, how they got affected, and giving the detail people need to know if they’re just hearing about this hack."
30,"Super disappointed in the folks at @SuperlativeSS. Was stoked to have minted my REPUS and have loved the project so far. 

They got hacked today so I logged on and was asking details in their lounge to see who was affected and if I was safe. 

I got muted. Can’t reach anyone."
31,"Ok, so now that I’ve revoked all the permissions from my OS contracts for items I had for sale, how do I get them back on OpenSea for sale again? Because if they sell, then they can’t transfer, right? There’s no permission to do so. 

I assume it’s just delisting and relisting?"
32,"@FishNFT I went and checked my permissions and I should be all set, but what you just said right there is more clear than anything from OS. 

OS should say in order: 
1) What happened
2) Who’s at risk 
3) Who’s safe
4) A clear, step-by-step guide on what ppl will see when migrating"
33,"@FishNFT Im not saying OS did anything wrong here. I’m just saying that if you’re going to have any future as a company, you have to assure folks immediately it’s not you. 

This should be REALLY easy to confirm whether these contracts were signed on the OS site or not. It’s not hard."
34,"@FishNFT The problem is the lack of detail coming from OS on this. 

Ppl need to know whether or not ANY exploits have come from migrating contracts on the official OS site. I did that this morning. Am I safe?

The fact that I can’t answer that confidently is really concerning."
35,"@isotile So did all this begin with the email?

I migrated my contracts this morning directly from OS’s website. No email used whatsoever. 

I still signed with Wyvern and that came directly from following the steps directly from OS. 

So are people like me safe(ish)?"
36,"@dev_allo @StyrFoem @AJFromDiscord @opensea I got this email as well, but DID NOT click anything. 

The question is whether or not when I migrated DIRECTLY from OS without using the email, am I also at risk?

No one has answered this yet."

38,@StyrFoem @MarkNFT @BAYC2745 Feb. 27 https://t.co/9ZxKUWKGje
39,"@_MouseDev @JacobOracle So the answer is that if you migrated directly from OS, you should be fine? So much confusion around if it began with the email or if it’s OS code."
40,"@0xfoobar Honest question: are these pop ups coming from OS’s website, or only for those who clicked on the email first?

I migrated but did it DIRECTLY from OS’s site while I was doing other things on there. I wasn’t led to their site from a phishing email."

50,"@daileytj @jason_argo2 Thanks for that to both of you! I had no idea the genesis also granted entry. 

Still might scoop up an extra for a friend. Seriously considering doing NFT NYC and might grab one so my buddy can come along. He’ll be up there with Veefriends."

How many IRL passes do you hold? Thinking of scooping another one so I can attend an event without having to burn my only one."
52,@Toad25265551 @BAYC2745 Your theory?
53,"@WeatheReportNFT All this he said/she said aside, your spaces today was a joke. It was just you guys rambling. There’s no leadership or structure here. Feels fly-by-night. 

This statement confirms it. Y’all are not ready to run a project. It’s harsh, but I think we all know this is true."

Lots of components will be burnt for DEMP, even further reducing the supply. After that, there will still be more opportunities and utilities for all three components IMO.
