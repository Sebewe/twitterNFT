this would force current contributors to uphold their status overtime instead of becoming complacent with huge token bags

past contribution is still legible, but less important"
17,"fungible tokens complicate governance since holders think about both their monetary value *and* what governance rights they afford

96,"@adampatel23 @jaesmail there's nuance, of course, but i see much fewer people fighting over who does what bounty or who joins what dao workstream 

and i think it's because token comp has upside built in

most vc associates get paid shit cash comp w/ even worse carry packages, so they fight over scraps"
97,"@adampatel23 @jaesmail sure, but i'm talking about internal structures

the way venture funds work today is win/lose — associates at big funds fight over deals internally bc there's only so much carry

the way daos work today is win/win — just because you contribute doesn't mean someone else can't"
