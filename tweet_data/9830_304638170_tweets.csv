93,"Yes!

If this photo was done in pos-production with photoshop wouldn't be as magical as it is now. 

So method for me is one of the reasons I might buy a photo, since I value that part of the art as much as the end result. 

6/7"
94,"So not only the photo is aesthetically pleasing, the method used is super original and only a few photographers could achieve this flawless result. 

This brings me to a questions I ask several times - Does the method used to take a photo matter for its value?

95,"@yael_malka Decided to make some stents to place on the front of the film and this way, preventing the light to get into certain areas. 

If not mistaken this a 1 photo from a total of 3 shots.

96,"On top of the great play of colour and subject,the composition is super original. That is what made me look at the photo originally. But this collection is a gift that keeps on giving

The most amazing aspect of this photo is the fact it isn't a collage and it's on film🤯
