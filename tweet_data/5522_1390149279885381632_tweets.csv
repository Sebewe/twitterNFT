5,"Even though i'll be having fun posting content i enjoy at that given time, it'll be detracting me from being a hyperspecialist in 1 topic. My major pain point was that cooking or other topics might discredit me from looking like a pro in crypto and nfts. My concern is valid, and"

12,@StrayAliens thanks for that. appreciate it.
13,Wondering how I can merge my content on all my sm accounts. Is it weird to post food video alongside #nfts? Thinking about the algorithm of course but I always believe I AM 1 PERSON and I should be authentic to whatever I want to post.

21,@cryptostacys Let’s throw a WELCOME party into #NFTs! 🥳🎉🎉🍾🎁🎊
22,"@KnownOrigin_io I never really understood multiple print editions even before nfts. It just didn’t seem authentic to me. Much prefer 1 of 1s. 

Of course if an Artist is solely relying on selling his art to make a livelihood, then multiple editions makes sense. Otherwise, it’s a no for me."
23,"NFT conneisuer or Nft #degen?

25,"friends even after it ended. She would always be the first to call me after a team meeting ended, to ask me questions, as at that time I was in crypto longer than her. I was happy to answer them and we got along very well even though she was older and of a different nationality."
26,"I knew 2 #Ukrainians in my lifetime. Both very, very friendly people. I knew one from modelling work and she’s here in Asia so she’s fine, but obviously worried about her family. The other one I met through crypto work. We became very close buddies on a project, and remained"
