18,@FlipsiesFlips @ape9400 @anwaNFT The best thing is that the platform supports both erc721 and erc1155 standards without any modifications. Any market place or any other application that supports these standards is compatible with composite NFTs 😎
19,@ape9400 Using @anwaNFT platform you can easily take off the blue bandana from the nft. Blue bandana will be a separate erc1155 NFT which can be transferred or sold and put on another NFT  🙃

82,"Thanks for reading the 🧵 and good luck in your dapp web3 journey. Please follow me for more information about web3, Blockchain dev, NFTs and more! Thanks 😊"
83,"10/10: finally the last but not least is the UI web3 integration. There are many frameworks available today, I prefer using react js, but it could be anything really. The cool thing is you can generate ts bindings with a simple tool
https://t.co/Lhw5yzeoXK"
84,"9/10: openzeppelin defender service can help! It is a service that can tail contract events and much more!
https://t.co/a7PQldtqMA"
85,"8/10: another problem you may face is the ability to react to certain events emitted by your smart contract and call a webhook, send an email or slack message. Tailing events would require building a new service. But we want to move faster and focus on business logic not infra!👇"
86,"7/10: luckily there is an easy and a fast way to create an indexer by using the graph protocol! It's also free to use in testnet!
https://t.co/2jHbHjZiN3"
87,6/10: Let's say you are building an NFT project based on openzeppelin erc1155 contract. You probably want to display all tokens the user has. Well it's not that simple! There is no way to get all tokens by an address. You need to build an external indexer to get this info.
88,"5/10: Now you can deploy your contact to testnet and even interact with it! However there is one big problem. It could be very expensive/ineffective to expose access patterns for range requests. Sometimes even impossible, here is an example 👇"
89,"4/10: 
4. hardhat-tracer - allows you to see the emitted events when running tests
5. typechain/hardhat - generates typescript bindings (I will talk about it later)
And many many more!
https://t.co/kN4zw7K2xg"
90,"3/10: IMO must have hardhat plugins:
1. hardhat-etherscan - allows you to easily verify smart contracts on etherscan
2. hardhat-gas-reporter - reports gas usage
3. hardhat-contract-sizer - tells you the size of your contacts (there is a size limit for your contact!)👇"
91,"2/10: Next you would need some kind of framework that will allow you to build your solidity code, test it and deploy. IMO hardhat is one of the best options. It has a lot of cool features and supports a bunch of plugins for better developer experience
https://t.co/xINoYWsYr8"
92,"1/10: The core of every dapp is a smart contract. One of the most popular programming languages to build a smart contract is solidity. The language is not hard to learn and understand, it is very similar to JavaScript with an aftertaste of python and c++
