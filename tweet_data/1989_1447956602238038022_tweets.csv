3,Starting to like # 9568 after all. This one feels like they need a name. Feminine vibes but just a jpeg after all. What do you all think? @DentedFeelsNFT #DentednotBroken #DentedFeels @Dentinmyhead https://t.co/cCuHTFlTwG

54,@bobvancecrypto @creatureNFT 💯 get it. I’ve changed mine a few times and even tried to convert all my NFT followers from my personal account to this one through posts and engagement. Moving my PFP was helpful in that way but as exciting projects emerge I’ll certainly change my PFP temporarily in support.
