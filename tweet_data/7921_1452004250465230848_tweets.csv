10,@123PattaP321 @puxekas @takoa__ I don't even know what this means. Anyways enjoy your $x2y2
11,@123PattaP321 @puxekas @takoa__ So then delist on OS?
12,"@123PattaP321 @puxekas @takoa__ I'm trying to post facts instead of false information that you are posting, with proof of what I did via screenshots. What's wrong with that?

Yes the requirements changed, but not to what is being described in this post."
13,@123PattaP321 @puxekas @takoa__ I'm not. Sounds like you're NGMI though
14,@123PattaP321 @puxekas @takoa__ What are the alternative qualifications? I unlocked by listing 5 unique collections
15,@123PattaP321 @puxekas @takoa__ https://t.co/i300Qk9idy
16,@123PattaP321 @puxekas @takoa__ Yeah none of what I listed was at or anywhere close to a 1E floor that I listed at
17,@123PattaP321 @puxekas @takoa__ I dont need to search twitter my guy I literally did it myself lmao
18,"@123PattaP321 @puxekas @takoa__ 1) Qualifying NFTs listed must have &gt; 1 ETH of trading volume in the last 24 hours on OS which is the same as for NFT listing rewards.
2) The NFTs must also be currently listed which means sold items will not count as we do not want to delay the airdrop any further."
19,@123PattaP321 @puxekas @takoa__ Are you sure you were listing items with 1E volume in the last 24hrs? That's the only requirement based on what the site says. Worked for me and everyone I know
20,@123PattaP321 @puxekas @takoa__ I didn't but keep making stuff up that's not true
21,"@HashishFive @puxekas @takoa__ You don't even need to do that, I don't know where people are getting this idea from lmao"
