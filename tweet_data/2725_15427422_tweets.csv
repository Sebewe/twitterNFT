1,"Congrats @Commsor on the recent round, exciting to see more and more investment going into the community space. 

https://t.co/CBrOj9u9aW"
2,"To be a great community builder you have to shift your mindset from creating content that people connect with to creating content that connects people to each other.

It’s subtle, but powerful. 

Always ask, “How will this content help our members connect to each other?”"
3,@rosiesherry @mattmecham @hlashbrooke do contributors get any of that profit?
4,"@Historian they're both models for creating products/value, no?

i've seen people say ""why launch a DAO? just make it open source"""
5,"@mattmecham is that true?

the goal of most DAOs is to build things that make the world better"
6,"@mattmecham @rosiesherry @hlashbrooke but altruism doesn't pay the bills in a capitalist system

our altruism is capped"
7,@Shanahasatwitr #fridayfunday
8,"Types of community posts:

- conversation starter: open ended question
- support: question with specific answers
- collections: ask for links/resources/promotions
- connection: help members find commonalities
- gossip: share trending news / information 

What are some others?"
9,@andy4edu kids are a cheat code for transitioning to life mode
10,"How I transition my mind from work to life mode when WFH:

1. Sight: change lighting, go outside, read book, no screens
2. Smell: light a candle/incense
3. Touch: stretch, take walk, touch grass
4. Sound: switch music, use a singing bowl
5. Taste: make herbal tea, have a treat"
11,@mhall119 @cosmicblend how I'm thinking about it is that they're both contribution models
12,"@ianhunter as I understand it (which is not very much) - part of the point of open source is that no one owns it. In web3, members own it."
13,@gcheung28 glad to hear that part resonated!
14,"@cosmicblend if you were to launch a project and were looking for contributors and a contributor model, would you not consider open source and a DAO two different options?

(genuinely asking... I don't know the answer)"
15,@simon_tomes i agree - though I see it changing already
16,"@sudotechie sort of right

you can join a lot of web3 communities without being an owner, though becoming an owner is definitely core to the model

in web3, in theory, you should also be able to show up and contribute without being an owner, and get compensated with ownership"
17,@cult_leader_en the reasoning I've heard for not doing this is that it makes the token a security
18,@rosiesherry @TheGrandWorld and @DinnerPartiers come to mind
19,"I would LOVE to read a deep dive on what the two models can learn from each other, similar to what @austinrobey_ wrote up for Co-ops and DAOs

https://t.co/EmAZHo4PWj"
20,"What are the pros/cons of open-source vs web3?

Has anyone written up a good comparison of the two models?"
21,"@mviktoro i agree that not every little thing should be monetized

but I also think there's a point where someone is contributing enough that they deserve comp/upside

also there are people who don't have the ability to commit time/resources to open source projects without comp"
22,@simon_tomes I believe that culture will change
23,"@hlashbrooke @mattmecham Of course, but there's a line where the amount of time and effort someone puts into a project deserves compensation, right?

And a contributor can only contribute to extent they're able to dedicate that time without compensation, something a lot of people can't do."
24,"@charlierward @austinrobey_ they have to be for-profit so they don't qualify for a lot of grants that are only made for non-profits

and they don't appeal to VCs because they aren't built for an exit or an IPO and are intentionally build to be owned by members"
25,"RT @Meetup: Life is full of choices, how you make those decisions dictates your path. 
Listen to @DavidSpinks and @DavidMeirSiegel discuss…"
26,"@mhall119 @hlashbrooke ah i thought it was - thanks for clarifying

does the same not hold true for open source projects that are acquired?"
27,"@hlashbrooke @mhall119 But the company is still determining the decisions that the members can make, the company can give and take away ownership any time, and the members don't have mechanisms to decide collectively."
28,@TreyLockerbie @_shahedk @jmj @SahilBloom @HarryStebbings we need answers @SahilBloom
29,"@hlashbrooke Even rewards don't translate to the same value as ownership though, and decision-making power is limited.

When Microsoft bought Github for example, the contributors didn't have a say in that decision, and didn't get any of the $7.5 billion paid, right?"
30,@hlashbrooke sounds like we need to find some time for a call (=
31,"@hlashbrooke Interesting...I have some noob questions about open source...

Does open source provide any mechanisms for compensating contributors?

How are decisions made in open source projects?

Is it true that open source has a challenge keeping contributors engaged?"
32,"@charlierward both still require members to buy in, and don't have a mechanism for rewarding contributions

co-ops have been the best option to date, but as i'm learning from @austinrobey_, funding co-ops is really difficult"
33,"In web2, the best we can do is give community members a ""sense of ownership"".

The ability to give community members *literal* ownership is one of the things that draws me most to web3."
34,"@hey_bernie @austinrobey_ i think we're going to see a lot of innovation and improvements in how DAOs are run, and once some of these systems are built, a lot of community-minded builders are going to be very drawn to this model"
35,"Just talked to @austinrobey_ about DAOs and co-ops for an hour on MoC and it feels like my brain is going to explode. 

Can't wait to share this episode with you all."
36,"@EzzaNaveed i recommend at least twice per year

you can also have a survey automatically get sent after x amount of time (we do 3 months)"

41,@AtamBobby precisely!
42,"@rosiesherry is the work that a community growth specialist does different from marketing, or ""community marketing""?"
43,@rosiesherry what do you think it would take for it to not be the exception?
44,@CorinneMRiley @eakinsey might have some tips
45,"“Great communities market themselves” is a nice thought, but it’s the exception to the rule. 

99% of successful communities I’ve seen required a lot of marketing to grow."
46,@whoopthis 💯
47,"@cult_leader_en After our last CMX Summit many attendees reported feeling a greater sense of inclusion at our virtual event than the in-person event because they're introverted.

My wife's a middle school teacher and belonging amongst students actually went up during virtual learning last year."
48,"@DruRly definitely @raihan_ and the @FWBtweets team

53,@pandymarino A feeling of belonging
54,@joelgascoigne @buffer appreciate you and Buffer for continuing to challenge the status quo around comp 👏👏👏
55,@jill_rowley @danyacg that's a good question! i'll ask her next time we chat
56,"@tomrossmedia i got on the y'all train and I haven't looked back

other than the occasional side-eye from my NY-based family, it's gone over really well"
57,@LifeWithArjay @Davidmeirsiegel @Meetup agreed! always have a blast chatting with him
58,"@drewmeyers what does it require? curious how you define it / where you draw the line

i like to think about under what circumstances could we consider ourselves a ""global community"""
59,@drewmeyers why not?
60,"Community is one of the most broadly defined words in the dictionary.

It can mean anything from ""family"" to ""every person in the world.""

So before you start building ""community"", take the time to get more specific about what it is you actually want to build."
61,"@francjp happy to hear it resonates, thanks for sharing Francisco"
62,"@jill_rowley I've long been a big fan of the idea of an MVC.

63,@avinashraghava glad to hear it resonated
64,@ReginaWalton @av to be fair I do have a yeti mug I use for my tea often but it's just because it's so high quality - not because of the brand
65,@evanhamilton @M_M_martinelli like they have for NPS*
66,"@evanhamilton @M_M_martinelli Do you have any resources on how to set up and analyze PMF surveys? And what a ""good"" score is, like they have for PMF?"
67,"@M_M_martinelli @evanhamilton not sure I understand how PMF allows for that in a way that NPS doesn't?

I think both of them are pretty vague, which comes with the territory of being a singular metric

we always as lots of other questions around NPS to get a feel for why they choose that score"
68,"@evanhamilton @iambethmcintyre yeah that's why I try not to use it as a pure measure of good vs bad but rather a way of identifying if things are wrong (NPS suddenly trends down)

also depends on the community - i don't see CMX as a community many people want to keep to themselves. reddit might be diff"
69,@NicoleBehnam i refuse to stand by and watch you cancel cupcakes like this
70,"@evanhamilton ohhh i like that @iambethmcintyre what do you think?

we do use NPS pretty consistently across all our channels - it's good to have a benchmark to compare against and notice if it's going down

i think both could be effective in that regard"
71,@tina_yip people best not be throwing away my swagger
72,@Keivansamani *unless your community is PhD students
73,"Swag won't convince anyone to love your brand. They'll probably throw it away.

But the people who already love your brand will love your swag and rep it proudly.

Lesson: Only send swag to people who already love your brand."
74,"@Bluegirlpdx @daniellexo I personally love using SOC as more of a brainstorming and planning tool to identify ways to improve your community, rather than using SOCi as an analytical tool.

But that's just me."
75,"@Bluegirlpdx @daniellexo SOCi is a really valuable tool. It provides a thorough analysis. My challenge with it is that it's a very complex survey to run and to analyze, and feels a bit more academic, missing some more practical questions and applications we focus on in our survey."
76,"@ZainaHmoud you do have to be mindful of survey fatigue

make sure to track how many surveys members are getting and prioritize gathering insights that are going to be most impactful for them"
77,"@Tom_Voltz1 @iambethmcintyre It gives us benchmarks on how members of these groups are experiencing the community. If members of specific groups are having a negative experience in the community, it helps keep us accountable to fixing those issues, and making the community more inclusive."
78,@markgrimes LOVE this

85,"99% of teams I talk to are missing a very simple community-building technique that would change the game.

If they do this thing consistently, it will 10x the quality of their community.

It's super simple. The MOST simple.

SO much exciting data this year."
88,"@evanhamilton @billjohnston @beccaodelay Honored every time I make it into the breakfast newsletter &lt;3 

We should do a real breakfast soon!"
89,"@Jihoz_Axie @cdixon Love this!

It's also important to note that the members who are part of production aren't necessarily the same members who are part of distribution.

Just like in web2, employees, advocates, and customers are all part of the ""community"" but in very different ways."
90,"Humans need a variety of community. 

Small and large
Intimate and passive 
Financial and social
Online and offline 
Adventurous and grounding
Synchronous and asynchronous
Anonymous and transparent 

No one community can provide us with the breadth of connection we crave."
91,"@jasongriffing @adamjacksonsf its an issue if the intention is to use tokens as compensation

if it's not used as compensation, and it only has reputational value, that's okay (and how online communities have always worked)

it just doesn't solve the compensation problem in that case"
92,@jasongriffing the flip side to that is that members won't benefit from the upside of the token increasing in value and won't be motivated to earn tokens through contribution
93,@gcheung28 twitter is a dangerous place
94,"@KR1573N I do believe that people often have positive intent (though not always), but what I've learned is that it's really important to separate intent from impact. And we need to be accountable for our impact (within reason), not our intent."
