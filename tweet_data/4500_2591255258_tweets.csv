9,@goldweard @niftygateway Just making it clear this is feedback on @niftygateway  and not your work @goldweard  🔥♥️
10,@goldweard @niftygateway Agree but @niftygateway did a terrible job on your launch that lost alot of trust. For some people it felt like a rug at the time especially as they quickly moved on... While on your discord seeing regular game updates and the effort that's gone into the game has been incredible!
