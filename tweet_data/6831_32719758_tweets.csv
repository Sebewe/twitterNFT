29,@Artistken1 And the fact that you call my post ridiculous is again your opinion.
30,@Artistken1 Well that’s your opinion as is mine. #respect but then we should agree to disagree.
31,@AlivisionA Likewise brother
32,@Knight_of_NFT @BhushanVishwas Very well said. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🤗🤗🙌🏼🙌🏼
33,@SanndyCreationz 🙏🏼🙏🏼😍😍🤗🤗
34,@Artistken1 @tkeditz__ Marketing and approaches are subject to many debates. The path one chooses can be debatable and all of us are wise in hindsight my dear friend. But you are right. Opinions are subjective and relative and hence cannot be baselines. #seriously
35,@kuntal_singhvi 🙌🏼🙌🏼
36,@Monachanart @AlivisionA 🙏🏼🙌🏼🥰
37,"@Artistken1 The other aspect is, do you always choose to look for agendas or do you focus on what you are doing? Here you is not addressed to you but more a conversation. So if people are commenting negatively on something does not paint the community with the same brush IMHO"
38,"@Artistken1 Tell@me something.  Is there any community that is all good or all bad? Humans are not made that way. But does one or two outspoken people, who share their feelings, make them bad? Never. They have an opinion like you and have a right to share"
