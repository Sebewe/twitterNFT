64,"15/

Giving the user an option to boost gameplay ROI can be a big use case as the NFT subcategory of gaming evolves."
65,"14/

2) Increasing ROI (return on investment) within an NFT ecosystem or metaverse. You can think of @Treasure_DAO's  Bridgeworld where engagement of gameplay via staking of native tokens and NFTs results in increased token emission for the user."
66,"13/
Use Case(s):

This is probably the most important, the “why” to the borrow. Two use cases below:

1) DAOs holding NFT assets and needing liquidity to pay expenses, contributors and etc. Selling their NFTs may not be an option due to liquidity constraints or social signaling."
67,"12/

You need a financial instrument that is highly sensitive to implied volatility to reasonably price the underlying asset’s risk profile.

The Put premium will dictate the cost (APR) of a loan against a given NFT/collection."
68,"11/

Options are a great instrument that incorporates the volatility of an underlying asset. If you look at the Black-Scholes formula there is a symbol σ (sigma) that denotes implied volatility."
69,"10/

One way to do it is in the form of a Put Option, requiring the borrower to purchase a Put option or insurance in the same transaction that they take the loan out."
70,"9/
Underlying Asset Volatility:

Extending a loan against an asset where price discovery hasn’t fully developed &amp; the liquidity is brittle comes with challenges. Specifically the need for Floor protection. There is a need for creating a composable insurance smart contract."
71,"8/

This also has an interesting byproduct, where people who cannot afford an NFT can participate in its growth by providing liquidity and getting an APY."
72,"7/

Rewarding the liquidity providers via the APR the borrowers are paying. This mechanism allows for a more frictionless experience for the user. You can think of Maker or Aave vaults, deposit collateral and get a loan."
73,"6/
Peer to Pool &gt; Peer to Peer:

Peer-to-pool allows for instant liquidity (stake NFT and receive a loan in the form of USDC or DAI). The mechanics require raising liquidity which serves as an underwriting pool that NFT asset holders can tap into."
74,"5/

An NFT asset holder announces that they have collateral in the form of an NFT asset Worth (W) and is looking to Borrow (B) amount of USDC or DAI for a duration of Time (T).

As you can see, there are many input variables to match."
75,"4/
Limitations of Peer to Peer:

There are too many variables to negotiate and match, hence creating too much friction for the user.

Lending or borrowing E.g

A lender makes an announcement that they are willing to extend a Loan (L), for a duration Time (T), at a Rate (R)."
76,"3/

Therefore we should look to them &amp; on-chain analytics to deduce historical data. Over time more pricing formulas will evolve &amp; serve as composable building blocks. In turn, makes the pricing of NFT assets more efficient &amp; accurate."
77,"2/

It is the central function in any marketplace. Today most transactions happen on Opensea and LooksRare. https://t.co/mUeSZyjB8C"
78,"1/
Underdeveloped Price Discovery:

Price discovery is where the buyer and seller agree on a price and engage in a transaction which later becomes a historical data point that can be referenced."
79,"Hello, frens!

This is a reply to @andy8052's question, “why do you think borrowing vs NFTs has not taken off yet?”

82,@davidmarcus This is coming from a place of curiosity and not hostility but how do you expect the mining rewards to be replaced by transaction fees in the future? https://t.co/B8das5rChg
83,"It is crucial to be mindful of two things when researching and building composable primitives

1) computational power
2) storage

This is underlined and emphasized in this article when discussing EMS - “it is cheap to calculate and requires little storage”"
84,"Here’s an example of an adaptation of the EMA (Exponential Moving Average) which they call EMS (Exponential Moving Sum)

It helps track NFTs sold over a recent time period

Similar to how EMA gives higher weight to recent prices, EMS does the same to recent prices an NFT sold for"
85,"I love how @_Dave__White_ and the team @paradigm constantly explore primitives in DeFi and NFTs.
