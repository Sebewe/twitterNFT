Promise one thing.  Do another.  Get greedy (and try to screw community in the process).  Community not happy.  Team act surprised.  Team look for sympathy.  Team then break more promises…

How am I doing?"
46,@robtswthrayguns @garyvee Some may laugh… but I can relate to this.  Genuinely.
47,"@garyvee 100%.  Market is saturated.  Money spread thinly across too many projects.  Many will fail as a result (and many will lose money in the process !!).  Money will leave the  ecosystem (likely to average founders / developers). Good projects will dip, but will recover over time."
48,"@lukesaunderson @ladbible That is very true to be fair.  For some reason though this one feels worse in the sense that he should not benefit (even though both committed a form of fraud).  Maybe it’s a timing thing, in that it feels more recent 🤷🏻‍♂️."
49,"@ladbible Funny as a meme and can have his 15 mins of fame, but he shouldn’t be able to make a career (and good money !!) directly off the back of scamming people. 😲

57,"@zeeshanclvx A little harsh, can think of at least 5 others that would be ahead of him on the list."

70,"@StonerCat_6918 @thomasg_eth But if you’re going to quote me, quote me right.  Said I stopped reading at the first message that talked about ‘free’."
71,@Huk06 @oyoops @711_Joseph @thomasg_eth Nor was this considered “an argument” or anything that I “need to win”.  Have a nice day.
72,"@Huk06 @oyoops @711_Joseph @thomasg_eth Quite the opposite.  Nearly followed up on my tweet agreeing with you on free stuff to say that truth be told I would normally do a discount or other fee arrangement rather than free, because I believe in knowing your value. Just couldn’t be bothered continuing the debate on it."
73,"@haroldrothart @thomasg_eth Yep.  You would at the very least be extremely wary (or better still, do some v. basic due diligence enquiries), especially if you planned on giving them any form of access to the Crown Jewels.  🤷🏻‍♂️"
74,"Boycott high mint prices before it becomes the norm.

Why degen at +1Eth for a pump to 2Eth etc… when you can probably get that same potential chance of that upside from a 0.01 mint etc, but with considerably less downside if it goes wrong.

Rewards nowhere outweigh the ⬆️ risk."

79,"@Huk06 @oyoops @711_Joseph @thomasg_eth They are unknown - but IMO it’s not quite the same level of “unknown” as it is here.  People receiving your offer would presumably be able to do some form of DD on you / your company, and definitely wouldn’t be giving you access to any crown jewels on day 1."
80,"@Huk06 @oyoops @711_Joseph @thomasg_eth Agree with that 100%, the same is true for myself, and in many lines of work - but when that offer is coming from Anon, and in conjunction with such expertise / value (and especially in this space), it would set alarm bells ringing for me - which was sort of the original point."
81,"@Huk06 @oyoops @711_Joseph @thomasg_eth That is fair enough. The fact that I have a pfp. of an Ape would have also sufficed. 😉 As long as it was not a reference to Neanderthal comments, because that would be incorrect.  I am simply intrigued as to what incredible value people are supposedly willing to give for free."
82,"@mmeJOAN @711_Joseph @thomasg_eth Agree, and that was sort of my point.  Always be wary.  If anything seems too good or is simply a great deal, then check, check and triple check."
83,@Huk06 @oyoops @711_Joseph @thomasg_eth Explain to me the reference to Ape please sir.  Intrigued.
84,"@oyoops @711_Joseph @thomasg_eth What are these incredible skills that you are willing to give away for free? 

I don’t have a project myself, but I’m involved in plenty that would welcome free assistance.  Got plenty of clients as well who would take you up on free work."
85,"@StonerCat_6918 @thomasg_eth No, just giving you the courtesy of a response, since you took the time to respond."
86,"@completelyrekt @BatmanBTCx @thomasg_eth But you know what he meant.

Suspect it was that if you look at lots of scams, a large % of them are poorly worded (this is just fact), and therefore I imagine they mean on balance this would cause some cause for alarm.  Not everything needs to be retaken down the racism route."
87,@oyoops @711_Joseph @thomasg_eth Good for you.  What free work do you have to offer me then?!
88,"@StonerCat_6918 @thomasg_eth Like i said, stopped reading where they will work for free.  Not hard to get the gist of the story from that.  Someone tried to scam w/ a supposed clever and elaborate scam.  Seems neither clever or elaborate (or something that wouldn’t have rung alarm bells)."
89,"@completelyrekt @BatmanBTCx @thomasg_eth To be fair, not  sure that is what he said… you took it there."
90,"@711_Joseph @thomasg_eth Whilst it does happen from time to time, it isn’t anywhere near as frequent as you are making out.  The sentiment that the web3 population holds hands and all help e/o for free is a myth.

Especially not with that many connections / level of value.  Would put on “red alert”."
