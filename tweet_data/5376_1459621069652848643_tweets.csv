18,As an ig influencer nft Twitter is like my oasis of shit I actually like. None of these posts are sponsored and I actually really really enjoy the freedom. The best utility no one advertises is this platform where I connect with like minded crypto babes.
19,@MunaTelt Twitter is our place that’s why #mfer couldn’t be happier for you you deserve all the frens!!!

22,"@cryptochungus_ @blindjoedeath42 I feel like it should be limited to the best artwork a creative can deliver, so even a 5555 project would be huge especially non generative. Definitely quality is important over quantity. To me as an artist and to my future holders I want to take care of."
23,@blindjoedeath42 I like 5555 projects that’s my favorite number lol but some should be even smaller I feel like that’s a way to create value a lot of people miss.

56,So the fact no one has done the exactly women themed project I have in mind is probably a clear sign to assemble a team and get to work. I KNOW people would love it since joining nft twitter. The more I see the more I want it to be a @NFTCryptoChicks colab.
