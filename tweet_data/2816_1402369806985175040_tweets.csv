These @DentedFeelsNFT are so fire @Dentinmyhead - great work https://t.co/WUdGko9SiK"
16,"@MoonHashira_ This so low rn, imma get some more today I think"
17,@fstopeth Of course none of this is none when they mint for 3E/each. This is about transparency more than anything imo
18,@MajorShankEm @NFLALLDAY Skipped this one
19,@alxocity Small S3 set so far 😅
20,@xBenJamminx How!
21,Replay pack open feature on @NFLALLDAY is super dope
22,@r_rainss Love you buddy 💜 thanks for sharing this
23,"But of the two options we’ve had so far, I greatly prefer the original pack drop method to this lottery/gamble system. I think I’ll save my dapper for the marketplace for now and just buy specifically what I want. Still a supported of @nbatopshot - just not the new pack system"
24,"But the numbers aren’t working out. If we were still buying $9 packs with chances at legendaries it would be different than having packs be ~EV neutral on average with ~80% actually losing money. 

I opened packs as a kid (tcgs, sports, etc.) and I’m used to the -EV pack."
25,"Maybe forgetting my spot in the elite queue this morning was okay 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

I’m seeing a lot of sentiment with where I am on avoiding the new pack drops from @nbatopshot 

Honestly I give them a lot of credit, this is what people were asking for and they tried it.
First🧵😳"
26,@Stoniphantom So proud of you stoni!
27,"@WavexPirate @swipathefox This feels like the best way you could handle a “rug” tho. Open, honest, and cashing everybody out 🤷🏻‍♂️

Maybe he’ll have time in the off-season and try again or maybe it was just a miss. Interesting"
28,@Stoniphantom Not buying it. I’m fading Creatures. There’s plenty of others place to invest my ETH

30,@pickem29 I went debut shopping today. My Obi dunk sold just in time for NFL MP
31,I’m not minting or buying a single one of the inevitable 100 “Invisible” derivatives in the next few weeks
