2,@altaccount4jo @ETHMovie You'll want to lock up your eth via the contract on their website and you will get rETH in return. You *can* just swap ETH for rETH on something like uniswap but that wouldn't have the same effect of actually adding stake to the network.
3,"@altaccount4jo @ETHMovie The network issues the rewards as incentive for people to stake. It's beneficial for the network to have as many people staking as possible when the merge happens (there's already 10M+ staked). After the merge, stakers will start to receive tx tips in addition to network rewards."
4,"@altaccount4jo @ETHMovie To be clear, you don't need to wait for the merge to start staking. Do it now, preferably with a decentralized service like Rocket Pool, or on your own if you have enough eth."

14,"@art_pleb Nothing is wrong with the client itself. The issue is that too many validators are using it i.e. it's a centralization risk.

Also don't ever write the word met@ m@sk in a tweet, it just invites scammers."
