80,@Mnewbis @Coinbase_NFT @doodles goodluck fren 💙
81,@Mnewbis @Coinbase_NFT @doodles okayy I can get behind that! one of the many stepping stones. Good idea for selling for a high value I think if you sell for anything less than you are comfortable with it'll be a bad reminder.
82,@StolenETH @CKongee @Loopifyyy a pfp is the first thing you see and have a lot of potential but I agree there isn't really anything original. projects are relying on the hype they generate rather than innovating a new idea and letting that be the foundation.
83,@Mnewbis @Coinbase_NFT @doodles woahh had no idea u did this make sure not to sell it LMAO
84,@cryptopom1 looks v serious to me
85,@KikiNFT thank you 😁 i been trying to learn to animate its difficult
86,@nekosmother lies need proof
87,@orphan_crypto when people stopped buying art for art and instead for brand/hype. both have advantages but people can get away doing low-effort stuff.
