3,"@GratefulApe_eth @BYOPills The team has said since the start and still today, pills are core to everything.  Take that as you will.  Land's plus side is you can earn $tryp with just land.  Pill you'll need an apostle to stake with it to earn $tryp.  Me personally, I'd want a pill and apostle first."

38,"@grantpat @GutterCatGang That would be cool but I’m guessing this will be an element of the ecosystem to drive utility for $gang (tokens on floor). So limiting it that severely really wouldn’t accomplish that goal. Which if you’re going to do a token, priority #1 is making sure they are value drivers."

40,"@0xSeba @BYOPills Picked up a pill ranked #735 two days ago as it felt underpriced. Some “rarer” traits and 12 trips, with high levels. So good balance. Figured out a few hrs later it hadn’t minted its apostle yet 👀👀👀👀.  Picked up a key and enjoying thinking about the possibilities lol."
41,"@hir0sn0w @BYOPills I was literally in the same boat. Thought the #735 ranked pill was underpriced and scooped it.  Few hours later decided to check on a whim and turns out, it hadn't minted its apostle yet. Bought a key and now just enjoying the possibility but holding off on minting for a bit."
42,"@Kimiro74114607 Yep. More often than not it’s the best marketers, who also create art, that are considered the “best artists”."
43,@MaxwellTimothyy @CoolmanUniverse Great pick up!  Welcome to the family!
44,"@crypt0savage @Gr0wCrypt0 @BYOPills @flipdrago The team has said from the beginning that the pills are core to everything.  So definitely something to keep in mind.  But to earn $tryp, you'd need a pill AND at least 1 apostle.  Where land you just need the land itself.  

Great place to start

53,"@joinaxie @beast_eth @BYOPills Added this pill for the balanced rarities/trip effects, it’s a top 1000 pill.  So might hold it with a key for a while.  See what plays out.  Had the 500th ranked pill and key at the beginning and said the same thing… Made it 3 whole days lol. So we’ll see what happens 😂😂😂"

Only downside, had to immediately scavenge 2E for a key lol. https://t.co/onqdnNA5q6"
60,"So with @BYOPills BYOLand getting attention that is way overdue. I think BYOPills themselves are undervalued now. After all, the team has said on multiple occasions, that pills are essential to EVERYTHING. https://t.co/n2lgCRYtK2"
