11,@BoredApeYC just dropped a new teaser image … Where’s that legendary ape who magically appears with a thread explaining why $ape token will be worth more than $BtC based on the hints from the recent teaser? I like those posts 😂😎
12,@nft_metaman @nftworldsNFT I loved the entire process but glad this claiming is all done. Let’s go!

16,@ArtHouseGarbage Hell yeah for putting yourself out there 😎
17,@AllRyLHedUp I bought one yesterday when they hit secondary. I’m very disconnected from any planned roadmap. It just felt like a good play after watching them develop for months. I plan to hold past summer. Did you buy?
18,@ZedShifty Perfectly said. 👌
19,@JWeb777 Yes actually. ThinQ or something. Terrifying taking it out of the box it’s so thin.
20,@Assualtgirls We’re just finishing a 3rd visit to the repair shop for our 55” curved Samsung. Never had so many issues before with a TV. We won’t do curved again 😔 But i definitely liked it.
21,I’m still alive… spent 0.5 ETH on Friday and bought an OLED TV 😳 Unbelievable quality. We’ve been glued to it since 😎

51,"@tmagled Yeah, just reading through the rest of the thread now. Sounds like you know what you want… just a little more of the winter blues and you’re there. Hang in there 👌"
52,@tmagled I can’t say I’m in the same spot but I’ve for sure had my moments of being low and not knowing why. Just wanted to say that you’re doing the best thing… talking about it. It’s key. Is your mental state NFT related or just life in general feeling unfulfilling?
53,"@tmagled L E G E N D 🔥

Such a great pickup I think. That big dip we saw… those were lifetime cat purchases for most people. I think the floor is solid."

78,@bzjb @beast_eth @coolcatsnft @evanluza Welcome!
79,@btown_p People realizing they were greedy and the current gains are enough. Others losing conviction in what they thought was a ride to the moon. It’s all in flow with the current world sentiment / markets I feel. It’ll rebound!

82,@boredapewood Well done. Sounds like a great move for your situation.
83,"I love the honesty here. I’ve done the same during past dips. It taught me I was overextended. You hear the term all the time and we all like to deny it but until you can see a dip and feel no emotion, you’re overextended. Here’s to creating a new plan and seeing it through 👏 https://t.co/G19mNHSlgI"
