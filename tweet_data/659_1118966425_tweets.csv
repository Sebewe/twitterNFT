2,@OGDfarmer If they picked up x2y2 bull listings/delisting/shopping cart and all that. Would make for a killer platform

8,@ShrewdCharlie If we don’t have a FOMO run up then we stay stagnant here for a bit after $APE IMO. Seems those that wanted to rush to sell out during FUD have been pushed out. I imagine some flippers will get pushed out but ultimately think it’s in the best interest to stake if that’s an option
9,@OGDfarmer But but but they’re guaranteeing my investment goes up😂😂😂
10,@Ape2047 @BoredApeYC #MutantMarch LFG!!! https://t.co/cNnNvGBcsK
11,@Ape2047 Seems a bit strange now that the collection is split onto two different pages. Could be both good and bad for the collection. If a dood is average but the vehicle is great - makes sense that it would be sold wrapped 🤷🏻‍♂️
12,@MacMuzzin @doodles Not fomoing about selling what was thought to be an airdrop 😂
13,@RDM_41 @machibigbrother @CapetainTrippy @kingtrippy5116 did the march 1 alpha come from here? was gonna listen but not available:?

30,@jmt_nft @phibacka31 Pretty sure it was Benit0 that confirmed RTFKT wouldn’t drop the collab cuz that’s “not how they roll” is the wording I think was used :) https://t.co/vf47RqYc6m

46,@rexwub Let’s rain dance together for an ETH dump so our jpegs pump 🌦
47,@rexwub Rexyyyy how’d it go?
48,@FriendlyJameson I think you left out the part where a creator teases a drop is coming then pulls back their statements saying oh wait nevermind
49,@FriendlyJameson Love you too bb

52,@degenalexx @cr0ssETH It’s a good start 😅
53,@cr0ssETH So maybe the money stayed in the ecosystem after all 😅
54,@rexwub Gonna be 🅿️uffing right through that Oxygen supply 😂
55,@OGDfarmer It’s hard when people are in the greed mindset to take a step back and list some “what ifs” incase it doesn’t work out. Everyone loves the “but what if it moons” option only 🤦🏻‍♂️

60,@beaniemaxi Don’t come in here stirring this shit after you sold your apes bro.
61,"@avarice_anon @Nate_Rivers Wonder when we would get confirmation of a delay… seems like that last update with the teaser pic of a show would have maybe hinted at a pushed back timeline. 

Totally irrelevant but the RTFKT collab disappeared into the abyss or what? 😂"
62,@ShortsHoward 😂
63,@lilbean_eth prolly still is... that's why I bought the floor cock ring for 0.05 lel + PV claim is still a go on these
64,Beanie really was a big fan of the cock rings.... https://t.co/ILvRwY80Ey
65,@richerd But the cute emojis now
66,@NeilSchwary @cr0ssETH @BoredApeYC Token number… wait for it… 11 😂
67,So what’s going on? NFTs bounced but we gonna top here cuz ETH bounced heavy or what? If we’re gonna start selling shit someone give me a heads up beforehand at least 😅
68,"@ShrewdCharlie Nice sale man, congrats! 

I gotta say though feels weird seeing everyone go apeless… like there’s some info I haven’t been whispered to about or something 👀😅"

82,"We like the 8’s 

#BAYC - 88e

&gt; Apes looking a little undervalued ~8e compared 1:5 with mutant floor 

&gt; Doggos trading undervalued compared to mutants at a 2:1  ~1.4e

&gt;Doggos also trading slightly undervalued to apes at a 10:1  ~0.8e

TLDR; doggos 🐕"
