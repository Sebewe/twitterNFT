27,"Again, this is all food for thought and hopefully it starts a discussion that leads to innovation. Clearly there isn't an obvious alternative to this process yet, but surely out there somewhere there would be."
28,I think it would essentially stop a lot of the rush if people felt like they had multiple opportunities to mint.
29,My counter to that would be people would learn to wait back and see how the first rounds play out. A lot of the time people go way overboard with gas wars because they know it's their only chance.
30,"As I am reading this after typing, I can see the first issue would be how to stop people just getting 20 failed transactions instead of 1."
31,"My thought is, let's say there is a collection of 10,000 being launched. Would it be possible to basically do mini gas war rounds? Like release 500 at a time and that way you would have 20 attempts to get in?"
32,"I love the concept of first in best dressed for mints but let's be real it's not whose in first, it's who has the most gas to burn."
33,Question for those more educated in the area: Is there a more efficient way to launch a NFT collection without having WL spots but also without causing a gas war?
34,Forced grinding for WL spots feels inorganic which is ironic because it is meant to promote organic growth in a community
