2,"@GenghisSperm Just short term vs. long term thinking. Crypto looks good here, I don’t know is about equities. Could be the great decoupling. Like what type of news would have us crash from here, beyond a nuclear war?"
3,"@GenghisSperm I feel like sentiment is WW3 is coming, but it’s not. Putin will lose and that’s incredibly bullish, plus the FED has an excuse to be dovish. Also consumer sentiment and savings is at the lowest it’s been in a really long time, the economy is nose diving. Printers are warming up."
4,"@GenghisSperm Too much astrology, FED will be dovish. US is the world’s safe haven, crypto has shrugged off a nasty FUD cycle and crypto is deviating from SPY. Markets are getting ready for mania, crypto is about to get stupid. All going into the $ETH merge. ETH $20-30k top. Then we bear."

59,"@investindigital @tbr90 It's still a tough call IMO. The FED has never in it's history hiked with this much geopolitical uncertainty. Now how much of this geopolitical turmoil turns into US affected inflation? Plus we have midterms coming up. It's a coin toss, but we aren't getting 5-9 hikes. Prob. 2-3."
