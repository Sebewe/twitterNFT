37,"@oemb1905 That's a good passive hands off strategy!

To me it's still good to know how much your dream life would cost 😁"
38,"@phreneticclay Right, I was thinking about putting that further in the thread cuz it's so important! 💛💛💛"
39,"That's it!

Remember to be selfish when visualizing your dream life.

Remember that your happiness doesn't come from money.

Happiness comes from the actions you take to be fulfilled."
40,"There's lots of expense tracking apps out there and a free template on Google Sheets.

You'll be surprised to learn where your money goes now. 

Tracking expenses requires complete honest with yourself.

If you fluff the numbers, your future self will bear the burden."
41,"Your current budget should be below your means.

Spend less on food.
Cancel subscriptions.
Find cheaper options for entertainment.
Spend your free time in a way to grow skillsets that pay dividends when you're older. 

And ACTUALLY track your monthly budget."
42,"So how do you get there?

I haven't hit my number yet. However, I have made progress in getting there. 

My understanding is you have to make short term sacrifices for long term gain."
43,"The total cost will change as your life changes.

And your happiness doesn't come from what you get in life, but how you spend your time.

At least now you know how much you'll need to truly be set for life."
44,"People are living longer, so let's assume you'll live to 100.  

Take 100 and subtract your current age.

If you're 25, you'll get 75 years left. 

Now take the yearly cost of living your dream life and multiply it by how many years until you're 100.

Years Left * Yearly Cost"
45,"Next, you'll budget for it. This includes...

Housing
Utilities
Food
Entertainment
Clothes
Transport
Insurance
Education
Savings

And add a bit extra to each category. Remember. Your dream life.

Use this to calculate the yearly cost: https://t.co/OoYPdjtoic"
46,"Start by thinking of how your time will be spent.

Will you live in a nice house so you can host gatherings? 

Do you want to have all the latest tech?

Vacations around the world?

Run a business with your happiness at the core? 

Visualize what this life will look like."
47,"First you'll need to know how much money you'll need to live your dream life.

And this dream life should be selfish. Remember, this is your DREAM life."
48,"Growing up, I never knew a millionaire. Or at least knew someone that didn't need to work if they didn't want to.

And money isn't everything.

But large feats are easier with a goal in mind, so let's find the number you can aim at to reach financial freedom."
49,"We've all heard someone say ""If I had a million dollars, I'd be set for life""

A million may add a lot of options to your life for a few years, or maybe a decade... 

But your life won't change.

Here's how much money you really need to be set for life...

78,"@0xKNNY It's been that way for a while - coin to coins swaps are taxed based on the USD value at the time of swap, and same goes for NFTs

I'm not a tax expert but crypto kinda forces our hand to know the rules

A good practice is setting aside 40% of profits in USD of every sale/swap"
