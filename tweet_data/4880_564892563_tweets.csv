0,@Loopifyyy @AB84 @boredpunksnft It takes more than one active brain cell to process that kind of thought. I can see we are clearly lacking that here in the video.
1,"This is precisely what a rug pull looks like, stay away people. https://t.co/6qG3rRfCLP"
2,@cr0ssETH True. Also I'd love to see the transition from projects to products now. I believe we have enough projects but the majority of them aren't backed by anything concrete except a plagiarized roadmap.
3,"@DeezeFi little high, very much low."
4,RT @Cryptanzee: WE ALL GOT BAITED https://t.co/uzpLptYlRP
5,"When I was 13 years old, there were a series of bombings in my hometown. One of them went off in the house right next to mine. I still remember the walls shaking and the smell of gun powder. It was awful. 

Thoughts and prayers for everyone in Ukraine right now 🙏"
6,"My timeline is something different. 

It goes from #NFTs to Putin real quick. https://t.co/jYZioKqKAi"
7,"I really like the aspect of Invisible Friends where half of your ETH will go invisible after the reveal.

Truly remarkable!"
8,"@superSZCZ4 yes, can't access right now."
9,@basedkarbon Feels illegal to be this early tbh.
10,@kayprasla Never heard of them before. I guess just the legal issues of operating as a blockchain organization back home is a good enough reason to not do it or be completely stealth while doing so.
11,"@kayprasla in terms of building, none yet or that I know of. The existing groups are too focused on flipping/trading."
12,@eip1559 You send me your valuable NFTs and I silently transfer them to another wallet with all due honesty. Just trust me ser.
13,@crispylines good ol' days. My youngest one was a newborn back then and just turned 20. They grow up so fast.
14,"@NateAlexNFT I'm considering getting Apple Airtags now. I thought of them as pretty useless when they came out but almost lost my wallet a few days back, and realized they could have saved me a lot of pointless stress. 

You should get some too for events like this idk."
15,HYPED FOR MY BUDDY FONG HERE! https://t.co/cVv1htv9kC
16,"@crispylines This might as well be the most colorful thing I have seen all day today so far, thanks to the rainy/snowy weather."
17,@TheShamdoo Technically you can't sue a company because some of its users lack the fundamental knowledge of protecting themselves online.
18,"People blinding sign messages on random phishing websites and then continue to blame OpenSea for their stupidity. 

Most of these people don't understand a thing about crypto security in general and hate OpenSea because that's what the cool kids are doing nowadays."
19,"@RyanBerckmans It's not even OpenSea's fault, I have no idea where these biased opinions are coming from. Give them a break."
20,"Due to the exploit panic, major websites such as etherscan went down as well. 

Traditional infrastructure has not yet evolved to handle the enormous amount of web3 related traffic.

We need more engineers who can build things at scale in the web3 space."
21,"@MikeBurgersburg @opensea @Bitfinexed @SilvermanJacob @molly0xFFF @zachxbt @coffeebreak_YT Those are all valid transactions. People signed messages they were not supposed to do.

It's still too early to say this is due to OpenSea. Unless it is clear, we should not point fingers in possibly the wrong direction."
22,"I personally never open any links from emails anymore. I almost fell for one of the phishing attacks years ago and it has been the standard operating procedure for me since then.

Never open links from a sent email. Navigate to the official website yourself."
23,"Looking at the compromised transactions, it appears to be a phishing attack. Valid signatures were used to sign the transactions. There's a high probability that a lot of people signed approvals using the phishing email. https://t.co/n05u0qcMvS"
24,"There's a vast difference between inspiration and blatantly plagiarizing. 

@crypto_chicks' art clearly uses existing artwork as the base and builds on top of it. 

It would have been better if they acquired the necessary rights beforehand, but they did not.

ngmi."
25,Made me smile today. https://t.co/r8XwkLT0oV
26,"@chriskalmar I have never seen such a list that mentions system design and architecture as well.

You can never be Full-Stack without designing solutions at scale."
27,"@RealWillyBot A knife is a perfect tool to slice veggies and make dinner for your family, but also for stabbing someone to their death.

Mediums/Tools are irrelevant, what you do with them matters."
28,"@hunterwalk There's an incredible amount of talent in South East Asia that is waiting to be discovered. I'm glad about the entire remote-first narrative pushed globally during the pandemic. 

The people are getting their well-deserved recognition."
29,"@jasvault I'm sure the team will come around stronger and address all the issues. Software is not meant to be perfect, and it can never be.

However, with sufficient end-to-end testing (ideally automated), we can massively reduce the execution risk."
30,"@jasvault Just because other projects failed to create a good user experience, it cannot be used as an excuse to do the same.

You have to strive to be the best in the space, and not compare with the failures of others to console yours.

It's a good learning experience at the end of day."
31,"OpenSea has its issues but many people don't realize that their favorite tools such as market aggregators, analytics etc rely heavily on OpenSea's infrastructure + data. 

Having a single point of failure can prove to be catastrophic. We need a more even distribution of data."
32,@gemxyz is one product that gets better and better with each iteration. Does exactly one thing and does it extremely well.
33,"I don’t know what’s worse, the tinder swindler dude promoting NFT projects or these anon influences using their followers as exit liquidity for $LOOKS?

Every day in #NFTs is wild."
34,"@cr0ssETH He is promoting NFT projects now, he will surely recognize your hoodie. https://t.co/ExV2gzjv10"
35,"Simon Leviev* 

It’s not his real name anyways."
36,"It’s official, Simon Leviv from the Netflix documentary, “The Tinder Swindler” is promoting #NFT projects now.

Don’t be surprised if he turns out to be one of your favourite anon influencers. https://t.co/Wn3Opjl5mM"
37,"@NanouuSymeon I use one screen, but it's a 49"" ultrawide setup. 

I have 3-4 programs open in parallel, don't have to ever switch between docs, implementation, and references.

Personally, it's highly effective and productive to be able to go hours without switching windows/using a mouse."
38,"@jam__gm Any application/protocol that makes use of ERC-721's capability to act as a token-gating/community interface, while providing practical incentives such as lower fees, free digital services etc. 

The standard itself has much more potential than to be used for just art."
39,"I do not know when did we set the bar so low for #NFTs that physical collectibles, merch, and events started to be listed as ""utility"" for newly released projects. 

It's embarrassing."
40,"People: ""we don't trade crypto because it's too volatile!!""

Meanwhile their stock portfolios: (Yes, this is PayPal) https://t.co/HcwHL6DCKT"

45,"@CapetainTrippy People are mad they aren't getting as much free money as they were 30 days ago.

Welcome to the internet."
46,"Introducing Netflix's next hit documentary:

The #NFTs Swindler.

Featuring all your favorite anon influencers you used to look up to last summer."
47,"#888InnerCircle literally makes no sense to me.

- Extremely high priced drops.
- The supply is through the roof (80k eventually? nope)
- Only value right now is that you get whitelist spots.

If someone fairly new to the space did this, it would be labelled as a ponzi."
48,"11 ETH mint price is not okay regardless of whatever you may have done for the space.

It is simply not okay."
49,king shit right here. https://t.co/ghyt0C0oar
50,@cr0ssETH $400 down here. It isn't a lot in ETH but that's $400 hard-earned money down the drain.

52,"@madsbrodt Furthermore, you are only factoring in systems with websites.

Some of the most complicated systems do not have frontends. They solely operate in isolation such as large-scale ETL processes, blockchain indexers, analytics engines etc.

Architecture at scale is hard, hence the pay"
53,"@madsbrodt I've been a Full Stack Dev for ~ 10 years, worked on systems processing 600 million trading messages a day and I can pretty much confirm that the duties of a Big Data Engineer vs Sr. React Engineer are far too complicated.

It's pretty obvious why."
54,@cr0ssETH @Coinbase_NFT nice bag ser.
55,@chriscantino that should be common sense imo.
56,"Public launches are hard. I think the @coolcatsnft team is doing the right thing by delaying.

A delayed launch is better than a botched launch.

This serves as a reminder of how early we are given the processes need to go a long way before they can be smooth enough."
57,"888 has been a prominent collector but the red flags cannot be ignored.

This is a good reminder for everyone in the #NFT space:

Pure Collectors / Investors =/= Builders.

Building is a fairly complicated skill and not everyone can execute it with perfection. https://t.co/s5Yu7Sp3f9"

62,"@funghibull @DeezeFi As much as that'd be useful, it can turn out to be a lot of work.

Communication is fundamentally broken in web3 and needs a dire upgrade.

I realized this problem back in May 2021 and currently have something in the works to address it!"
63,"Every day I wake up and witness how horrible UX in the web3 space is. 

Time to step up the game."
64,"@DeezeFi Basically a notification system that is self-managed by the projects and allows sending private notifications (only critical ones) to all holders of their specific tokens?

Yep, currently in the works!"
65,@AzukiZen is going to be my gold standard for PFP projects. There is not even one Azuki that is not pleasant to look at. The team absolutely nailed the art.
66,@machiavillain_1 @BoredApeYC still early imo

69,@farokh The price of $ETH becomes irrelevant because building on top of Ethereum is priceless!
70,"@NateAlexNFT They also have ""MutantBats"" coming up soon. Every project launching nowadays has the same roadmap:

1- Main Collection
2- Mutated / Altered version of the Main Collection
3- Pets/Companions etc

idk how I feel about this."
71,"@0xBender If I accidentally listed something for far less than its original value, I'd want nothing more than to have it back.

There are a million ways to make money in this world. You gotta do the right thing 🤷‍♂️"
72,"I’m pretty sure if twitter blue subscription was charged in ETH, everyone would have had it instantly 😂"
73,"The most valuable product of 21st century is community.

#NFTs have proven this above and beyond."
74,"PFP worth 200k: 🥵
3 bucks a month to have it: 😡🤬

NFT Twitter never ceases to amaze 😂"
75,"Seeing all this hate around NFTs, like it or not it’s happening."
76,I wouldn’t be surprised if Twitter came up with 10k hex pfp project after this.
77,"@ChrisJBakke Sounds promising, I'd like to invest in your pitch deck. Can we strike a deal?"
78,"Value first, DAO second.

If you try to do opposite, it will not work. I promise."
79,"@luneyguy @0xBender NFTs are not legal binding. You do not get ownership of their brand by simply it throwing money at it. They can literally add a user agreement to the site tomorrow that negates this claim and people are left holding bags.

It’s very simple to understand what they are doing."
80,"@chinfongart Same dude, I need more 😂"
81,@DopplerJess @SuperRare Congratulations Jessica! Way to go 🚀
82,How can one go back in time and buy more $LOOKS? Asking for a friend.
83,"@NateAlexNFT Absolutely. It’s only when you go in depth you realize how blockchain revolutionized digital ownership. We mostly see art as the major application nowadays, but its impact will be felt across various industries in the coming decade."

People pay thousands for branded bags and shirts anyways."
88,@cr0ssETH ser you misspelled nightmare.
89,"RT @cory_eth: Imagine owning an Ape, but you're still paying rent to a landlord.

Please reconsider if this is you."
90,@karine_hsu I did not pay $200k in tuition but reading this still hurt.
91,"I found the terms and conditions of @feeswtf a little odd.

You are charging 0.01 ETH to claim the airdrop but cannot ensure that at least your site is accurate at all times? 

I understand waiving legal liability, but this is just plain bad for $WTF holders. https://t.co/4TCVctVFEH"

95,@Breedlove22 Volatility makes it a risky savings account. Even using USDC or any prominent stable coin provides a more risk averse option for people just getting started in the space.
96,$LOOKS like it’s a good morning today 📈🙌💎
97,"@Maestro_rR @YourFinanc3 The token is only 2 days old and does not even have a single complete weekly bar on the chart.

You are still extremely early ;)"
98,"Collectible #NFTs should be backed by a tangible product that brings value in one way or another. 

If you are doing it for the art, there's no need to make 10,000 of those."
99,@yungwknd how did I end up on wisdom twitter today.
