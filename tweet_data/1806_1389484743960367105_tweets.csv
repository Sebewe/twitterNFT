18,If anybody has any experience in putting something like this together I'd greatly appreciate the help.
19,I have family and friends affected by these floods in the northern rivers area and they were the lucky ones. Most who live in these areas worse affected cannot afford flood insurance and may never recover.
20,The Australian government has been notoriously apathetic towards people who have been affected by natural disasters in our country. Many still haven't received bushfire relief funds from years ago.

Tech - art - community - gamefication - organic growth. This is my long term bet."
59,"@twoweeksbrah @0xCana Haha fuck I hate shilling.. 

Here's a few obvious ones 

Global brand - World of Women ( already super expensive but the growth has been very organic and sustainable. Luckily minted a few early)

Metaverse &amp; interoperability and access. The MetaKey - still very cheap imo"
60,"@0xCana @twoweeksbrah Respect your opinion mate but I'd bet heavily against this call.

Not saying anything I hold will be the next Disney but there's huge potential  in what's being built in the quieter corners of this space."

62,@0xCana @twoweeksbrah My best investment so far funnily enough have been my NFT's
63,@twoweeksbrah @0xCana How is that different to shitcoins?
64,@0xCana @twoweeksbrah At least it's fun and offers a the prospect of investing in a potentially massive brand which has more upside than most shitcoins.
65,@0xCana @twoweeksbrah Of course there's endless shite but it's a developing space that is way more appealing to new comers who see these coins go to 0 after a week while the whales are still in profit.
66,@0xCana @twoweeksbrah All these shitcoins with their absolutely awful distribution really push argument for NFT's being a better gamble. I reckon it will be hard to get retail into these projects in the future even in better market conditions.
67,@ReNMLG @johnnieboy30 @trader1sz They are not equivalent just because they are similar. Your reasoning is based on a situation which is now over and one that hasn't even fully developed Taken out by a fascist dictator. You draw a long bow.
68,@ReNMLG @johnnieboy30 @trader1sz I haven't hidden behind anything my points were very clear. One conflict doesn't negate another. Both situations similar but also very different in so many ways in particular that this one is 5 days old. Get a grip mate
69,@AtmMyst @ReNMLG @trader1sz This conflict has only just started you will see over the next 10 years how this will shape the world in a much more significant way than anything in recent history
70,"@AtmMyst @ReNMLG @trader1sz How is it hypocritical? 
  Many people opposed the conflicts in the Middle East. It makes absolutely no sense to make this comparison it's argument for arguments sake. Drawing a fairly long bow here mate, what's the point? We can't be outraged because the US invaded Iraq?"

75,@AtmMyst @ReNMLG @trader1sz Everything about this is different. Doesn't mean what America did was right and that we shouldn't be calling out these atrocities.
76,@AtmMyst @ReNMLG @trader1sz Putin's motives are completely different. You're talking about a racist psychopath who will stop at nothing to bring back the old Soviet Union. I don't deny America's terrible track record but these what about isms are fucking pathetic.
77,@Rothmus Nothing more pathetic than ct tough guys comparing adhering public health orders to fighting for your country.
78,@ReNMLG @trader1sz I never denied that what US did was bad. My absolute main point is these what aboutisms are rubbish and Putin is a psychopath regardless of what America has done in the past. You're clutching at straws proud boy

80,@ReNMLG @trader1sz Nothing but propaganda and what aboutisms. Fucking pathetic really.
81,@ReNMLG @trader1sz Your comparing a conflict that had different motivations - circumstances and that has already ended to something that has only just started and could end up ending with a world war. Saying Putin's bad does mean to say that America was right.
82,@ReNMLG @trader1sz The motivations and actions are incomparable Putin is a fascist dictator no matter how you spin it. But you right wing nut jobs love swallowing daddy Putin's propaganda it's what you call free thinking I hear.
83,@maevald11 @trader1sz Cool story
84,"@ReNMLG @trader1sz the motivations are incomparable. Did America invade Canada because of their shared history and cultural and linguistic similarities? Did they send tanks to Toronto to force Trudeau to resign? Nah, and if they did, you better believe that there'd be an outrage."
85,@ReNMLG @trader1sz Comparing Putin's invasion of Ukraine with America's of Iraq or Afghanistan is an insincere comparison and it's deeply rooted in people having their anti-American blinkers on
86,"@ReNMLG @trader1sz We should be capable of seeing Vladimir Putin's murderous imperialist designs for what they are, without having to always refer back to what big, bad America has done"
87,"@ReNMLG @trader1sz Believe me, I comprehend anti-American imperial sentiment, sure, it has been responsible for some of the greatest injustices of the 20th and 21st centuries, but it isn't the only tool in my shed, if you know what I mean."
88,I tried to keep politics out of my CT account but fuck it. This shit triggers me.
89,"4/ There's nothing more infuriating than somebody so far removed from the fight justifying this imperialist aggression. 

Make sure you take note of all of Putin's sympathisers. If this war escalates, they will be the enemy."
90,"3/ On that, have you seen many people from the west justifying Putin's atrocities? CT is full of these tough guys saying that he was provoked and that his cause is just and that Ukraine is full of Nazis and all of these other right-wing-nut-job talking points."
91,"2/ Nah, there's no way that they have that level of self awareness. And given the way the disinformation pipeline is shaped, they probably buy the Kremlin's arguments anyway. After all, it was daddy Putin who's been ideologically feeding them all along."
92,I wonder if – after seeing the sacrifice and courage of everyday Ukrainians – freedumb fighters in Australia might realise that they were carrying on a bit about public health measures and the government wanting to give them free life-saving medical treatments? 1/ 🧵
93,@maevald11 @trader1sz No I'm representing myself love
94,@trader1sz There's nothing more infuriating than somebody so far removed from the fight justifying this imperialist aggression with false equivalency logic. Just swallowing more of daddy Putin's propaganda like a good little muppet.
