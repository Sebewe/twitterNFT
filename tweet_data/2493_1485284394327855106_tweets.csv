1,"@itsjvon I am doing that too, except I haven't quit my job and I don't have another source of income yet.... I should get off twitter and do some work.  Maybe if I keep pretending to work they'll just give me a severance package and I can walk."
2,RT @arbo_art: My daily artwork exercise..  self portrait.  #NFTartists #ArtistOnTwitter #trees https://t.co/lnRfms6Acp
3,"@neiltravers Yes.  I do it to myself.  I am sure I am a workaholic but now I see the way to unify all my passions in one entity, so I am motivated to see it through!  What are you working on?  Anything fun?"
4,"@coffeejunkienft Thanks, you too!   Now I need more coffee. ☕️☕️😵‍💫"
5,"3) One of my personal businesses.  My biz partner happens to be a blockchain expert and ran a VC backed fintech startup. We've are still working out details of the structure, but we are working to reduce the racial wealth gap in the US with a micro-PE fund. DAO is an LP?"
6,2) a club focused on spiritual enlightenment and building intentional communities according to Vastu principles and in connection with the natural environment.  We have a pretty cool artist lined up who is also an architect that specializes in biophilic designs.
7,"1) a fashion-tech IoT startup has teamed up with an NFL player / social impact investor (yes, we'll have swaggy looks and 100's of discords, lol...)  They're working on an innovative approach to make a social impact, and the athlete is actually a core team member and investor."
8,"not a bad thing, I don't want to slow them down, but I guess it puts more of a time pressure on me to at least start seriously community building to make sure I can activate the community in support of these projects that are coming out:"
9,"Seems like at least three other collaboration projects are already starting to move forward, and may launch or at least have a public presence before I launch the nzemi genesis DAO access collection."
10,"nzemi has always been envisioned as a holding company DAO of sorts for my future projects, but also as a loose consortium of individual creators, and part of the goal is to support and collaborate on other projects, while giving members in the nzemi DAO access to these as well."
11,"gm fam.  quick update before I tune out from NFTs for the day and start my day job work...    

even though the website is not quite released (working on the faq page still), I have three partner projects that are already beginning as well, some exciting stuff.  1/#..."
12,"Would be very cool to make the first 100 pieces a mini generative collection, but actually make analog, messy, 4 color gum prints of them after generating a clean digital jpg, and then digitize that print as the nft. Each one becomes a true 1-1. https://t.co/kdTv2YaisY"
13,@djdepasquale Indeed that is true!
14,"@djdepasquale Thank you!  Building slowly to start but will be picking up momentum soon, and I appreciate the support!"
15,"Jumping the gun a bit, details of the benefits that go to OG holders will be on the website (in the FAQ that  I'm still working on...)  but if anyone wants to help me get the liquidity I need to buy a @cryptomories, these first two are now listed as of today. https://t.co/K8aQHPkNfq"
16,"Instead of finishing the FAQ this morning, I made this fan art for the @goopdoods art contest.  figure I'd at least share that with you all.  love what they're building, and @toronto_person's art is great.. hope they're OK with my interpretation. #NFTartists https://t.co/B02XoJtkxH"

22,"but things will start to pick up. slowly and organically, I have no rush other than the fact that I'm anxious to start implementing some things on my roadmap."
23,"oh man, I am so slow.  almost there, but not quite ready to pull the trigger on making the website public.  Just to keep full transparency - things slowing me down:

1) currently one man team on this ... for now
2) other major project happening
3) can't ignore family time."
24,"@rj I used to be hanging out in VCtwitter, and those guys and gals always liked to poke the other side constantly and then complain about the backlash.  Even comments about investment strategy were often cloaked political taunts.  It was gross."

28,going to carve out 3 hours today to work on the website.  fingers crossed that I get it to a point where I can make it live.  Anxious to move on to the next step.
29,"@TheBlazedApe in all fairness to him, I have never seen a pheasant use wifi, so I guess they wouldn't have a need for it."
30,Wow.  So much work has gone into this.  Really hope I can get WL for this! https://t.co/RAK0SMUb7h
31,"my art seems all over the place in terms of style and themes, but really, it is all about imperfection, impermanence, and the process of giving up control.  bringing this into generative art and web3 is one of my long term goals. #NFTartists #analogart #bwphotography #web3 https://t.co/EZpkROKHLx"
32,RT @NoQik: The public just started! LFG!
33,@goopdoods @nickybz @rj @digi_digit
34,"yes, I always re-tweet my own work.  Is that bad twitter etiquette?  People ask me if I was raised in a barn, and I say yes, I was.  I don't understand etiquette.  Thinking about maybe using my art and photo portfolio NFTs as early access nzemi DAO membership cards. #NFTartist https://t.co/OGDbuep4QK"
35,"@NoQik Yes, I checked it out and am interested.  Great art, great plan, long term project. Exactly what I like to support, and what I like about web3."
36,"@krybharat Correct, but the challenge is how to verify integrity without reverting to the horrible systems used by intermediaries in the non-trustless systems: ie credit reporting or the even more dystopian Chinese social credit system.

Does an answer exist already? DYOR seems not enough."
37,RT @iammoteh: Gm world. Find you inner peace. https://t.co/vXtuwtnypj
38,@NostalgicScarl1 GM.  Weird is the best kind of art.  🤪 https://t.co/UeB7ofbRlt

42,"just an experiment, probably not planned for a collection, and if I did this would need a lot of refining still, but I like publicly sharing my creative explorations for better or worse #NFTCommunity #NFTartist #trees https://t.co/NGza2yEvJL"
43,If I can get to the point where I can create art full time (or even 1/3 time) one project I do is for sure going to be a ultra high res macro landscape photography series of decaying and decomposing wood.  It's like a surreal micro universe designed by master artists. https://t.co/gtnBEWVpKo
44,"RT @bhokasawat: Today i make another one. It's about chairs, places, and memories.

47,"Changing my PFP to my @WoodiesNFT since I have two of them, and can only hope to come close to achieving what they have so far.  Maybe some of their mojo will rub off on me.  

Previous PFP was a collage I made a few years ago, still like it. https://t.co/jnwcnreUOT"
48,Awesome to see so many teams in the NFT space making a difference here! Would love to talk to both once we get closer to launching our plans.  I think we all have some shared goals. https://t.co/GtJXR1f41H

50,@WoodiesNFT Thanks.  Just a small bit of southern New England woodlands that is in our care.
51,@WoodiesNFT https://t.co/QiULDegJ2t
52,@WoodiesNFT Yes.  Slowly taking the reigns from my father. Working out conservation and responsible development plans.  Long term goal is for it to be a center of agroforestry research.
53,"@WoodiesNFT I am stuck in front of the computer, but at least I'm working on plans for my forest estate, so I'm spending time in nature in my head?  If it's warm tomorrow I'll take a bike ride to the park with the kiddos. https://t.co/0RJOkC89Pb"

60,"@arbo_art here's another 10 year old sketch from the same time period that I refined today.  This is an odd one for me in many ways.  I'm not sure if I even like it, but I'll post it anyway - I need to put it down and get back to work on a really fun ppt for the day job. (jk, not fun.) https://t.co/FeafC0vCDs"
61,"One key ability I have that has served me well in investing and in NFTs is a very refined BS detector.

authenticity, honesty, and transparency are a key part of any business or project I want to be a part of, and it is a big part of what nzemi is about as well."
62,"Yet, I am creating my own NFT project already?  Some would call this a ""red flag"" and I don't mind.  You'll have plenty of time to do your research on me and my team when we are fully doxxed.  Our experience is relevant for what we're building."
63,"I am still an NFT noob ... although I dabbled in crypto and blockchain since 2015, wrote a few whitepapers and helped on some ICOs that we didn't follow through with because the market felt too scammy and didn't want to associate our biz with that."
64,"@arbo_art I am totally wasting time, but here is a 10 year old sketch that I just refined in my current style. This will not likely be an NFT, but who knows. #art #drawing #nftart #sketch https://t.co/Sjiwd2pPeJ"

68,@justthego Yes.  💯
69,"Just putting this out there as a thought. imagine tiny off grid rental cabins and luxury yurts integrated into the forest. Frequent events (like outdoor horror movie screenings in the woods, foraging classes, meditation retreats, etc). Sound like a good membership benefit??? https://t.co/2G66r6MXka"

72,"unfinished sketch from today.  will continue to work on it over time, but felt like sharing now while it has a certain simplicity that I like.  just getting myself back into daily stream of consciousness drawings.  The bird appears to be inspired by @WoodiesNFT #nftart https://t.co/kR3lqZrwLq"

79,"Here's another image from my portfolio before I sign off.  This is an analog B&amp;W silver print.  no digital effects.  All in camera and in developing.  Wish I had my darkroom set up again. 

And as I said, share your art and I will always rt. #nft #art #photography https://t.co/gCFr0pxBqx"
80,😍 https://t.co/xGlfxcHVc4
81,"I am an artist, filmmaker, and also an MBA.  I have an artistic style and projects that I plan on seeing through, but my vision is not the artistic vision for nzemi. Any other creator who joins with us can execute their own vision, and participate in the combined ecosystem."
82,Will always rt art posted to any of my threads (unless offensive or majorly nsfw) - and this art by Moon is great.  The core philosophy of nzemi is about the combination of left and right brain.  Creating an organization that is a cultural blend of art and business. https://t.co/td69UFy1bu
83,"@jastidesigns you're 16?! That's great work, and a lot of commitment for someone your age tbh.  I mean, I spent a lot of time drawing and coding when I was your age, but had no where near the focus to get something like this done.  You're going to do some amazing things!! LFG https://t.co/frSBNzkNx1"
84,"@KapettaNft @rpnickson I'm opting flow slow &amp; steady, building a real biz and organic following. Hype and following trends is a bad reason to buy, but speculators are building up a bubble that may hurt the real projects - but those that are survive have true long term potential. https://t.co/jjL3ju5oST"
85,@onmygrzzly @danielgothits I second that.
86,@imfoofs @rj Yes I agree!
87,@rj @imfoofs Thank you!! 🙏
88,"@imfoofs @rj I may ultimately have to push back some of the dates on mine, but all of it is getting done, lol. but that said, I agree. I like an ambitious plan, but it should have a realistic and viable path to success. For us, that will be in the white paper, which is really a business plan."
89,"I don't care if your art is an NFT, if it's digital, physical, or whatever. I just want to see and be inspired by other creative minds. If anyone wants to collaborate, lmk. But whether we collaborate or not, would 💚 to see more art of all styles.  I'll start with a REAL old one. https://t.co/EVpRhoIy70"
90,"Well, I am holding a few details back, but just waiting to reveal them when I'm 100% sure I'll be able to deliver.  I need to hold back my own excitement on these parts of the plan."
91,"While it may seem by some of my tweets that I'm being mysterious or trying to build fomo for Nzemi, that's not the case.  I'm just building in public to hold my feet to the fire.  If I haven't shared details it's because I'm still working some of them out."
92,This is all true. 💯 https://t.co/exoxLzW2ck
93,"@ohhshiny I'm an old school businessman. Our white paper is a biz plan. Not building hype for a quick mint, or following anyone's pre-built template. Seems obvious to me that this needs to be done, but I understand the temptations that creators have to capitalize on the bull market frenzy."
94,"Not sub-tweeting anyone in particular, but one thing I am definitely not going to have in this project is excess hype with inorganic growth prior to mint, slip up on execution, and get stuck with a community of 20k+ disappointed people.  Slow and steady wins the race."
95,"hey #web3 and #NFTCommunity - If you want to be a tech co-founder or a community co-founder of a uniquely ambitious project, send me a DM."
96,moved my @WoodiesNFT pfp over to my main account.  added a new temp pic here of an old digital collage I did which may or may not reflect the vibe of nzemi.  Do we even have a vibe?  That's all TBD.  you are still really really early. https://t.co/bsuqQVmBo4
97,@ryancarson @proof_xyz I know right! 😂  But we are so early still that the space has a levelling effect.  So many use cases still to be explored and we will see more and more people from old-school businesses coming in. Myself included.  I am just now making the migration from Slack to Discord.
98,"With all the cat projects in the NFT space, I figured I would post this old drawing I made of my late friend Rugby  - sleep well, Friend and I hope you cover ever surface in the celestial plane (or wherever you may be) in fur and dander. https://t.co/MYrfAkohFR"
