1,@steven__rea So if I buy a flower even if the previous owner claimed I would still be able to claim?
2,@steven__rea Will there be a way to tell if the shirt has been claimed for a particular flower? I'm hoping to get a flower soon

40,@_benxit_ @ValiantNFT @DeadHeadsNFT @AvaStarsNFT I'm with you. That valiant art looks great. Poor dumb pixelmon minters. My point is that good art alone does not a moon make and nfts with bad art can take off. My greatest mistake in nfts was not buying bayc when I could because I didn't like the art
41,@_benxit_ @ValiantNFT Good art doesn't always mean the nft will moon. I think @DeadHeadsNFT and @AvaStarsNFT have great art but mfers are like 15 to 30x the floor.

86,@crystalgroves Media is mostly propaganda. You don't hear about those because the perpetrators pay a lot of money to obfuscate the issues and keep people distracted with nonsense. Look into the Azerbaijani laundromat. Some people call it caviar diplomacy
