Traders are looking for gaps in the short term.

Investors are looking for gaps in the long term."

2,"@ShinobiGumi Unfortunately true.

There are many people who will try to take advantage of them and they lack the tools, experience, and advisors that people who become wealthy slowly have time to accumulate."
3,"@jamesmarshall17 True, but the people buying their 3rd Bentley and 2nd mansion like these people are claiming would already have peace of mind. It's a different world."
4,"It's hilarious that people pretending to be rich investing gurus think that super wealthy people pay ""cash"" for houses and super cars.

No, they finance it against their portfolio for 1.75% and keep that money in the market where it makes way more money."

12,"Price and value are not the same.

In the short term price is a leading indicator of perceived value.

In the long term price is a trailing indicator of actual value.

An investor's goal is to find where the gap between those is large. That is extractable value. That is profit."
13,"@ShadowOW3 If you have multiple wallets in MM they all share the same seed phrase. So if the compromise is because you gave someone you seed phrase they are all lost. But any other compromise and they are 100% isolated.

Don't give anyone your seed phrases! Ever!"
14,@LandonOGardner Load the same seed phrase into the other wallet.
15,"@sankiking @moses23__ @opensea @BoredApeYC Exactly. It was for sale for 22ETH and he accidentally put in a WETH offer for 70. The bot saw that it could buy at 22ETH, immediately sell it for 70, and profit the difference. So it did."
16,"@sankiking @moses23__ @opensea @BoredApeYC It's an arbitrage bot, nothing to secure against. Just be careful not to mistakenly offer way more than something is worth and you're fine."
17,@Saltyjustino You're very welcome!
18,👀 https://t.co/PWzCra2FLO
19,"@Saltyjustino Nobody really knows since we don't know anything about $APE yet, but it's a reasonable guess..."
20,@Saltyjustino If you have a hardware wallet you should be using it for 99.9% of your activity. And partitioning your assets into different addresses controlled by that wallet.
21,@Saltyjustino Yes. Your apes are always online and always held by your address. A hardware wallet doesn't store your apes. A software wallet doesn't store your apes. They both just store the keys from your addresses. The only difference is that in the ledger the keys are air gapped.
22,"@6thmanTO @TheDEGENtleman @_PPMan_ Yea, practically an infinite number."
23,"@Saltyjustino Your hardware wallet doesn't actually store your ape in it. Your ape is on the blockchain.

The wallet just stores the keys.

There's no way for Ethereum or anyone else to know if you're using a hardware wallet or a software wallet.

Does that make sense? Or even more confused?"
24,"@Saltyjustino Collabland and snapshots are totally different.

Snapshots record blockchain state at a point in time and can be used for airdrops, voting, and tons of other stuff.

Collabland just verifies that you control a certain wallet to discord."
25,@TheDEGENtleman @_PPMan_ I linked to my thread on asset partitioning inside of this one. Give it a read.
26,"@TheDEGENtleman @_PPMan_ I'd say as soon as you have assets that are significantly more valuable than the others or you intend to hold for a long time. 

You only need a single hardware wallet to do that. You can have hundreds of addresses on a single hardware wallet and only one seed phrase to secure."
27,"@Saltyjustino The same as anyone else is...

Maybe I don't understand your question, can you clarify?"
28,@mike455mike @crysyphus @BitcoinDaddy69 @Ledger @ShiftCryptoHQ And wallets like the @gridplus Lattice have SafeCards that you can securely backup your key material onto.
29,"@mike455mike @crysyphus @BitcoinDaddy69 Some wallets do have a feature where they can show the seed phrase again, but many do not.

For example @Ledger Nano does not, but the BitBox02 from @ShiftCryptoHQ does. This could be one reason to chose one over the other for backup purposes..."
30,"@mike455mike @crysyphus @BitcoinDaddy69 I would recommend that you always have one plaintext backup of the seed phrase, but I wouldn't give that out to others.

Wallets given to others are a serviceable backup in that you could use it to get your funds out and into another wallet whose seed phrase you do have."
31,"@BitcoinDaddy69 @crysyphus This present a similar risk. Your family members have to cooperate to access the funds and they may not know how or they may not want to. 

Managing your assets after death is a whole different story, but again in general #SimpleIsSafe."
32,"@crysyphus @BitcoinDaddy69 This is why I recommend sending a hardware wallet to these 3rd parties.

It's still secured by your pin/passcode (make sure it's a good one) so you don't need to trust them fully."
33,"@BitcoinDaddy69 @crysyphus I tend not to recommend this because of my ""simple"" principle.

You now have two single points of failure, if either relative loses it or you're unable to reach them to get it you do not have a valid backup.

This can work, but for most I don't think it's a good option."
34,@moses23__ @opensea @BoredApeYC Regardless of exactly what happened this sucks. Sorry man.
35,"@moses23__ @opensea @BoredApeYC Here's my best guess from looking at the TXN:

First, you accidentally offered 70ETH on this mutant.

Second, an arbitrage bot noticed this and in a single transaction bought it at the market price and accepted your 70WETH offer making a ~43ETH profit after fees and the bribe."
36,"@d_fins I would just very very carefully verify that the seed in your wallet matches your backup.

Or, if you are getting a second hardware wallet for an additional backup if the addresses match when you restore that wallet you're fine.

You just want to be sure that your backup is good."
37,@d_fins Yea if you do that.... https://t.co/DiGpQvqJoF
38,"@JoseColchao We speak our🧠 and our 💗 is literally beating out of our chest, we couldn't be anything but nice. 🫂

Also, thank you!"
39,"@sssvenky @CRYPTO_TAG @cryptosteel Yep, looks very similar.

I'm only mentioning stuff I've personally used since I don't want to recommend anything that I can't vouch for.

It's not obvious from my quick look at their site. What keeps the letters from getting rearranged?"
40,"Step 6) Sleep like a baby👶

Your crypto is safely held and reliably backed up.

I hope that you've found this helpful.

If you think this would help others please share it so that we can all  #StaySafe!"
41,"Step 5) Transfer

You can now confidently move assets into your new wallet! 🎉"
42,"4a) Note the first address generated by your wallet.
4b) Reset the wallet and restore it using the seed phrase you backed up.
4c) The first address it is now generating should match the address you noted in 4a. If not you, made a mistake somewhere. Correct and try again."
43,"Step 4) Validate

Ok we've got a hardware wallet and we've backed up the seed phrase. Now we validate the backup before transferring any assets into the new wallet(s)."
44,"You can employ multiple of the above approaches at the same time.

The only hard rule is that plaintext backups like paper/metal should only be kept by yourself.

Giving your plaintext seed phrase to someone is the same as trusting them with all your crypto.

See Step 1 above 👆"
45,"Another approach is to just write it on paper.

I don't recommend this for high value wallets because paper is easily damaged (water, fire, insects, etc...), but for low value wallets this is perfectly fine.

You can always upgrade your backup later if the value increases."
46,"Storing it on metal is a very durable way to backup your seed phrase.

Solutions like @CRYPTO_TAG and @cryptosteel are great options.

You can also DIY with a metal stamping kit. If you do this I'd recommend taking inspiration from the above available solutions."
47,"One way is to buy another hardware wallet and load the same phrase into that wallet. 

This approach doesn't store your seed phrase in plain text, so you can store it in a safe deposit box or with a friend/family member without having to trust them 100%."
48,Now let's pull all that together and look at some ways we can backup our seed phase that meet these criteria.
49,"Tested

A backup that you haven't tested and confirmed works is not a backup, it's a hope; and hope is not a recovery plan.

Periodically check that your backups are where you think they are and are in good condition. I use daylight savings adjustments as my reminder to do this."
50,"Independent

It's not very useful to store your backup in the same place as your primary. If your primary is stolen, lost, or damaged, your backup likely is also.

They should at least be stored in different areas of the home and consider storing it in another location entirely."
51,"Simple

Complicated backup strategies often provide little additional security, but introduce many points of failure.

Put another way, you're way more likely to screw it up than it is to stop someone else from taking it.

#SimpleIsSafe"
52,"Secure

We want it in a place where it will not be forgotten or easily taken without our knowledge.

This place have an environment that will not damage the backup; climate controlled, dry, no corrosive chemicals, etc..."
53,"Durable

This is important information and we don't want time or the elements to damage or degrade our backup to the point where we can't recover our seed phrase from it.

Ink fades/runs. Paper can be eaten, dissolved, or burned. Even metal in poor conditions can be damaged."
54,"Offline

We want our backup to be offline, because if we back it up online then we defeat the purpose of having a hardware wallet. Our key material is now vulnerable to network based attacks."
55,"A good backup is:
- Offline
- Durable
- Secure
- Simple
- Independent
- Tested

Let's explore what each of these means."
56,"Step 3) Backup your seed phrase

If you have only one copy of something it's not a question of if you'll lose it, but when.

You've got one copy of your seed phrase in your hardware wallet.

We want at least one additional copy."
57,"Protect it with a memorable, but strong, passcode; i.e. not your birthday.

IMPORTANT: A hardware wallet doesn't protect you from signing malicious contracts or messages. Check out my other 🧵 for more on that: https://t.co/39NoJ0hRDm"
58,"This will keep your seed phrase safe from malware and other network based attacks.

If you have an existing wallet, do not reuse that seed phrase. Generate a new one using the hardware wallet when you get it.

Don't transfer anything just yet..."
59,"Step 2) Get a hardware wallet!

Here are some reputable hardware wallets that are worth checking out:
- @gridplus Lattice
- @Ledger Nano
- @Trezor
- @ShiftCryptoHQ BitBox02

Order direct from the manufacturer and check the package for signs of tampering when it arrives."
60,"Step 1) Educate yourself

None of the steps after this will mean anything if you tell someone your seed phrase.

NEVER👏GIVE👏YOUR👏SEED👏PHRASE👏TO👏ANYONE👏FOR👏ANY👏REASON👏"
61,"Time for another Security🧵(this is a long one)

You've decided to self-custody your crypto, hooray! 🎊

But now you have this seed phrase that you need to keep safe. You need to make sure that you don't lose it, but you also need to keep others from getting it. What do you do?🤔"

Peace needs all the allies it can get. 🕊️ Let's not make this a contest."
67,"@NBATopShotEast Might I suggest ""@mattborchert is a loser"" for consideration?"
68,"@BLACKCUBESTUDIO It's fine. If done correctly it's less risky than connecting your other wallets. With no approvals on your vault signing messages is much safer.

Still check the domain and the message itself before signing, but it's perfectly fine."
