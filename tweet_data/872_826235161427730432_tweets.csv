8,@CalcioNFT Hi
9,@EtherMikee @Legend @dannycoleee yeah but didn't erupt until like 3 hours ago
10,"@Legend @dannycoleee in all fairness, danny literally doesn't look at his phone 2 days every week for sacred drawing days. i believe him he didn't know"
11,...is this alpha? https://t.co/Fri1K2QQSN
12,@ape9400 @Kry5tian_eth @DentedFeelsNFT @NFTethics It's the project by the Weather Report artist after they split - NFTethics covered the dispute so they definitely know about it.
13,@Kry5tian_eth @DentedFeelsNFT @NFTethics Idk why people are buying it. Dude churned out an entire project in 2 weeks just to front-run WR and make millions.
14,@cgdawgity MSG? Almost went
15,"@ape3593 Yeah, tough to please people with a non-dilutive addition. I personally think it may set them apart long-term but we shall see."
16,@ape3593 what about doodles?
17,@coldpizza_eth Short-lived PFP
18,Will there finally be a #2 NFT clothing line?? (#1 is @creatureNFT obviously). These shorts actually look dope https://t.co/UuFTaLoQz8
19,@DavidMCarbajal Love to see a @creatureNFT holder make it. Gz!
20,@CryptoRobC @thingdoms @thingdoms is your best bet. I also like Fox Fam and Toy Boogers (boogies are at 0.7eth but close enough)
21,@itsdanataylor @doodles we gotta make this happen
22,@wenmilk_eth @dannycoleee he's ok i guess
23,"@defineartclub can't get them all. if you do, you're not doing nft's right"
24,"RT @dijosong: LETS TALK ABOUT IT! 

https://t.co/ion4RqlMgu"
25,@dijosong truly
26,No other NFT project is producing high quality shit like @creatureNFT. This is because Creature World isn't an NFT project. It's something that will create its own category altogether. @dannycoleee is leading the way for a new form of experiential and experimental art. https://t.co/MSHm8BE15A
27,@BananaPunk1942 @creatureNFT @advisry there's literally no competition. https://t.co/HxtZoQy5Ik is the only NFT clothing line i'll ever buy
28,@itstylersays @therealTJones OpenSea really is shitting the bed if they think this is a reasonable signature to ask for
29,@kerryflips @M_Danger1 Perhaps depends on the Discord. I sent my Doodle to the vault and lost status in their discord.
30,@kerryflips @M_Danger1 Collab Land does revoke access when you transfer.
31,"@NFTethics You, good sir, are one of the stupidest accounts in NFT Twitter."
32,@jake_spitty @incognito_eth You got it right. Etherscan under maintenance. Blocks aren’t up to date. It won’t update once you revoke. Check back tomorrow.
33,@flipdrago @opensea This is actually crazy. Eyes are peeled to see Opensea’s response
34,RT @andrwwang: with all due respect @opensea needs a tweet out rn
35,Everyone be safe out there - use https://t.co/wjU2lUL0TE or etherscan token approval to revoke privileges. better safe than sorry. https://t.co/sw5PBhZsMu
36,@chibiapegang @NFTLlama Did you migrate NFTs over to the new OpenSea contract?
37,@nftboi_ @CoolmanUniverse present https://t.co/i3SvEGDAR3
38,"@pudgycreature Agreed. I think the next several projects to pump will be the ones trading between 0.5 and 2eth right now. My top picks are Creature World, Coolman's, and Thingdoms. Keeping my eye on Deadfrenz and Alien Frens too"
39,@NathanHeadPhoto Thingdoms is undervalued
40,@0xSesh disturbs me to the core
41,@LaloNotLalo @ToyBoogers great pickup
42,@0xSesh i dont like this
43,@Ghost_King_11 @CoolmanUniverse @coolcoffeedan this one is awesome

50,@farsekel @CoolmanUniverse @coolcoffeedan As you should
51,"@kapstone @CoolmanUniverse @coolcoffeedan Appreciate it! This one definitely stands out vs the other rares, I agree"
52,"@kingg_eth Organize projects into folders (I have one for “blue chips”, one for second tier, and one for mints that I leave shortly after). Mute most servers. Turn DMs off"
53,"@farsekel @CoolmanUniverse @coolcoffeedan I’ll keep good care of it, don’t worry. Hope you put the ETH to good use elsewhere :)"
54,"@TheMushroomGen @CoolmanUniverse @coolcoffeedan this one definitely hits different, damn"
55,@dancu3e @thingdoms damnnnn!!!!
56,@ScubastNFT @CoolmanUniverse @coolcoffeedan Up to 5 now! But probably going to end at 3-4

74,@coldgogurt @creatureNFT @dannycoleee Ooga https://t.co/1CmKNc0Hbk
75,"@NFTethics I’m all for uncovering rugs, but this is such a dumb post. These screenshots are not evidence of anything - they’re half-baked connections. Are you getting paid to kill projects or something? Your reputation is going right down the drain IMO."
76,@fleeb_eth bruh
77,@creatureNFT seriously @creatureNFT's music is half the reason i love the project
78,@bobvancecrypto @the_x2y2 waiting for @0xQuit to do his thing
79,@greg16676935420 @creatureNFT let me talk to them
80,@NickyBeaster @creatureNFT @dannycoleee This is huge

88,@Editk7 @bendetta666 @creatureNFT Great pickup
89,@lukeabc gm ser
90,@itsmechase The 7.5ETH+ sales have been going crazy. Very bullish sign that smart money is expecting blue chip status.
91,"@ashrvin @doodles @doodles, @creatureNFT, and @thingdoms are always alpha"
92,@bitcoinchap I was pumped when I noticed him - one of the best
93,@deemchop @dannycoleee lol wow this is a gold response
94,@deemchop @dannycoleee My grandma has had to use QR codes at restaurants for 2 years now. Target demo is not narrow.
95,@maxnorris__ Best commercial yet by far. Nostalgic and new
96,@nesanel6152 Paying $6M for a super bowl ad with a malicious QR code...would be next level hacking
97,@AprilBrown_ @CoolmanUniverse spesh and creature - gmi
98,@jhonscjdude @CoolmanUniverse This is one cute spesh
