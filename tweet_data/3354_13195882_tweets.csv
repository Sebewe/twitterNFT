53,@BrettRichey Was looking into this a little bit - I'm not sure you CAN even burn the OpenSea tokens with the OPENSTORE contract (which as far as I know isn't actually published). The OS mints are ERC1155 (pretty sure). Best bet is to migrate and send to a burn wallet IMHO.
54,"@BrettRichey @LostSoulsNFT 100% - had two dead projects come back in the last couple weeks - @approvingcorgis had an approving bone NFT that was all but dead, now floor is 4ETH - and @DegenzNFT shot up from 0 to .25ETH. Guess it's time to circle back to LostSouls."
