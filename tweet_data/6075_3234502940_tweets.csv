62,"If you're working on something that doesn't quite make sense, stop doing the same thing over and over again just because it has always been done that way. Fix it now so that it makes sense."
63,@futwolfhardware I would do that as long as they adhere to that same idea. Tolerating intolerance is dangerous ground.
64,"@futwolfhardware No the person who physically committed the crime would be, but in your view the group's religious ideology would be protected under freedom of speech and you'd be dead."
65,@futwolfhardware They won't let you survive disagreeing with their ideas dude.
66,"@futwolfhardware At some point you have to stand for something and back it up. If it's freedom for all, then that's what you protect with everything you've got."
67,"@futwolfhardware Would you protect the rights of the intolerant who themselves threaten the legitimacy of entire groups? You'd be fine with ISIS setting up in your literal back yard and you would be there protecting their rights, because it's a ""slippery slope""."
68,@futwolfhardware I absolutely WILL silence and censor hate speech. Make no mistake about it.
69,No I will NOT protect hate speech under any pretext.
70,@Helloimmorgan it's like a racist saying I like black people but I don't like that they have dark skin. Does not compute. By saying homosexual acts are evil he means those who commit such acts are excluded. Can't have it both ways.
