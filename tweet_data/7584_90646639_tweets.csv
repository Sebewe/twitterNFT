77,@dragonseller88 DE took some action this am. China is likely waiting to see response from West against Russia to gauge their thoughts on Taiwan. US bonds giving out 7% interest which could mean they're starting to fundraise for potential conflict as well. Sentiment around hybrid war (diplomats)

79,A potential take (the sunny side). War also brings additional legislative powers and legislation. Could be used to over regulate https://t.co/cJwh1HcD4Y
