55,I spent a whole chairlift ride shilling @nftworldsNFT to this guy and his son yesterday. And it was a fixed grip too
56,@Rexy1065 @tmagled @nbatopshot @PackripEwing I agree I think 5-10 years from now most S1/2 plays will be valuable I’m just not gonna spend another dime opening packs when I can use that money irl to do stuff that makes me happy instead of rife with disappointment
57,@twallace1010 @TradingFemale No I have my recovery phrase written down somewhere I currently am not. Will unlock it when I get the chance but I have no use for those tokens anytime soon.
58,@TradingFemale Never selling my xrp (because I can’t)
59,@bettertorun @ABigThingBadly @Benjamin23ts People have been telling me that a lot lately. Must be a top signal
60,"@TradingFemale It’s okay. That one has all my btc and Xrp holdings, not gonna need it anytime soon"
61,@TradingFemale I have 2 but got locked out of one the other day thinking it was the other one
62,@NotTheDrPhil Mini chocolate chip pancakes until you zoom in 😰
63,@bettertorun @ABigThingBadly @Benjamin23ts I’m just waiting on one of my cousins to mint a male baby human so I can gift my whole collection
64,@DiscoverXnft In retrospect it was foolish to think a web 0 company could make a good web 3 product
65,@DiscoverXnft What a colossal waste. I was told having 4 grants extra utility is that a farce as well?
66,@Fevurs @quirkiesnft We love the quirkies
67,"@Rexy1065 @tmagled @nbatopshot @PackripEwing They should have made a more desirable product. I blame them for wasting my time and money, both of which I’ll now be spending elsewhere"
68,@tmagled @nbatopshot @PackripEwing I’m done with top shot products. Last NFL all day pack was the final straw

74,@YatMuseum @PuffYatty Same artist who got mistreated by WR team and started his own project. Love supporting dented but wish it was a little easier to tell the two apart
75,@daniel100eth @DiscoverXnft I love threads from both of you. Literally never read a sub stack article. Why not open Twitter on your computer?
76,@theashelina @AdrielYong This literally just happened to me and I was kinda blindsided
77,@danielgothits I always call airline customer service when I have literally all the time in the world (long drives or WFH). and then I let the employee know I have all fuckin day. They usually get more helpful when you let them know you have that leverage over them.

89,"Ordered thai food tonight it Salt Lake City and it came with fortune cookies. Do we think that’s because the restaurant is inauthentic or because the customers expect them? 
-note the noodles were the wrong shapes for what we ordered"
