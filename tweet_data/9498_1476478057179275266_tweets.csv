52,@jpegplug @BoredApeYC Yes 👍 depends on the situation. But yes some airdrops do be useless. If i showed you my hidden folder you would vomit
53,@jpegplug @BoredApeYC Again it has to be an airdrop from a good project to be a utility. But if i get some bullshit airdrop then Its useless. It really doesnt but if you like to keep your bias thats fine. An Airdrop is a utility as long as it gets you money back but if its pointless then I agree
54,@jpegplug @BoredApeYC Lol does it matter how long ago. It was an airdrop that gave you a good chunk of money. Airdrops are utility in the right places
