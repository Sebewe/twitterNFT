59,@JB0NE_ @Wolf_J_All_Day @DigitalCLIQ That is what we have been working on for the past 2 months and the code is just a temporary fix. Within the next few weeks you will be able to connect your Metamask to our Shopify to verify ownership.
60,@Wolf_J_All_Day @DigitalCLIQ Shill other NFT’s? They are my friends projects that I get our community white listed for. What’s the problem with that? I’m for the community and this is not a competition. Lol
61,@Wolf_J_All_Day @DigitalCLIQ It’s a community based NFT and you don’t have to be part of it and it has many utilities that must not interest. Instead of hating on something you personally don’t like that a lot of other ppl do you can just move on. Simple as that. Lol
62,@Wolf_J_All_Day @DigitalCLIQ Merch discount is the least of our utilities. Wtf. Lol
