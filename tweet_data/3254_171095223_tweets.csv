Honestly I’m not fan hard wallets for NFTSl 

BLAH! 😑"

25,@GoTrillaGorilla @PhedEU @Gfunkera86 @monkeybetdao @punkscomic That’s wise and still believe Punks will do extremely well and no need to even think about selling but you never know what’s going to pop up anymore in this space. But a statement is 100% needed from PV
26,People are not aware that Owlman who is the founder of Monkey Bet DAO runs the servers for Punks Comic it seems. It’s why a statement from PV is needed
27,@GoTrillaGorilla @PhedEU @Gfunkera86 The guy that made @monkeybetdao and runs servers for @punkscomic
28,@GoTrillaGorilla @PhedEU @Gfunkera86 But Owlman is
29,@TopShotWiz @derekcapo @beaniemaxi @garyvee @owlman1of1 Well Punks Comic also… you’re telling me PV had no idea what was happening with those two
30,RT @KeyboardMonkey3: We got a viral ‘not great’ for Beanie chain going if anyone else wants in
31,I really hope @punkscomic investigates this and does the right thing and ultimately parts ways with Owlman.
32,I’ve said since @monkeybetdao did a stealth drop of baboon bet and didn’t tell MBD holders that something wasn’t adding up about it. I was blocked by Beanie and banned from the discord for asking questions. I was also attacked for questioning Owlmans involvement in Punks Comic https://t.co/EBFWyNsDHM
33,@NFTethics I called out @monkeybetdao when they dropped Baboon Bet and didn’t tell the MBD holders. I raised concern and got trashed by the community and then ultimately i was banned from the discord for asking questions about it. SMH!
