20,"@helterskeltr1 @muratpak It’s Political/political in the sense that it is pro-democracy to support Assange, but not in the sense that it indicates a preference for one or other Political Party - because it doesn’t."
21,@helterskeltr1 @muratpak the fear among journalists worldwide is that Assange is a test case and if US govt succeeds it will throw conspiracy charges against any future investigative journalist who has any sort of relationship with any source. I.e. investigative journalism would become impossible. 2/2
22,"@helterskeltr1 @muratpak The Assange case is not political. In US case law, it is unprecedented to use the Espionage Act against people who simply receive classified information, even if they then publish it. Conspiracy in any context is a very indefinite offence.

26,@GTArajgaming @vodafoneuknews No. You should rewatch it if that’s what you think.

Not ideal for all other collections either as Punks are a bellwether for NFTs.
