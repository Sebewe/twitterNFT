38,"3/3 @PropyInc is abstracting the ownership layer by having their LLC control the title/etc. It sounds like a pass through ownership scenario where NFT holder has rights to -&gt; title? It's not yet clear to me. Ultimately, a blockchain-backed virtual closing table would be novel."
39,2/3 I'm not saying @DocuSign will be antiquated anytime soon but the possibilities are endless with smart contract signing. Documents as NFTs held on-chain (most likely private in some way) but easily available to authenticated users.
40,"1/3 I have been saying it.  Watch out title agencies! When closing documents become integrated into smart contracts: Watch. Out.
