1,"Web3 is a decades-long journey

If you’re jumping at every opp that comes your way—every dollar, every project, every partnership… you’re boxing yourself in

Take the long road"
2,"You can spend your time teasing roadmaps

Hustling for partnerships

Chasing clout

Or you can just drop something people actually want"
3,"Flip an NFT

Invest in a web3 startup

32,It’s amazing what not raising money can do for a business.
33,"Not sure what’s worse:

Raising money when you’re not ready

or

Raising money from the wrong people

People seem to be in a hurry to do both though."

53,"When crypto is at its most accessible, users don’t even realize they’re engaging with the blockchain

Mainstream users don’t need to know much about Ethereum, zk-SNARKs, smart contracts, or even NFTs

They can receive most all benefits of the network without the complexity"
54,"There is no doubt that over the mid-term, we will take our share of losses.

There will be turbulence. There will be illiquidity.

But over a long time horizon, if NFTs continue to deliver innovation + utility, their growth is inevitable.

The market is shifting. Are you ready?"
55,"Market Clarification

-As awareness of scams, pumps, and paper-thin leadership increases, collectors become savvier and veer away from red flags
-Accounts and tools that vet projects gain popularity
-Speculative markets are increasingly clarified and balanced by participation"
56,"Alternative Chains and Transactional Frameworks

-Increased volume on L1s and L2s as collectors hedge overexposure to ETH
-Investors seek arbitrage on emerging chains similar to their “early days” in ETH
-Opportunity for both breakout performance and getting completely rekt"
57,"Leverage and Access

-The “defi-ization” of NFTs provides greater optionality through collateralization, fractionalization, and lending
-Overly-leveraged projects will bubble and pop
-Lowered barriers to ownership increases access to blue chips and strengthens communities"
58,"Utility

-Alpha community access becomes increasingly sought after and costly
-Communities that consistently provide alpha and receive allow list allocations for top projects effectively “print money” for members
-Gaming, land, defi, and access NFTs outperform relative to PFPs"
59,"New Projects

-Provide most affordable points of entry, with the highest risk/reward exposure
-Increasing number of illiquid projects; more bagholders
-Liquidity increasingly distributed
-Prevalence of pumping and ponzis
-Surge of experimentation, innovation and utility"
60,"Mid-tier Collections

-Projects between 2-6 ETH vie to become blue chips via partnerships, events, and world-building
-Appealing investment vehicles, as they have demonstrated product market fit but need $$$ to scale
-Provide high-growth exposure with less risk than new projects"
61,"Blue Chips

-Institutional money buys in to allocate exposure within ETH
-Asset class reinforced due to low supply, provenance, and “store of value” designation within portfolios
-More blue chip collections arise
-Some market leaders decline when outperformed by emerging projects"

71,@itsmechase I agree and when I say alt blockchains I do include L2s
72,"In 2014, ETH was easy to dismiss.

Quality apps like M*taMask, OS, and ENS were inelegant at conception, and took years to mature.

Today, alt blockchains are in their infancy, but with 1000s of developers busting their asses to ship breakout apps.

Invest on a long time horizon."

89,"@Research4Nft @the_x2y2 @LooksRareNFT It’s just like Shopify.

Merchants provide buyers with better, curated experiences, and enjoy better margins.

Collectors also enjoy better margins (no % to OpenSea).

Projects can still choose to participate in distribution channels like OS in addition to their DTC marketplaces."
90,"@srinathariharan @dennishegstad Novel, Flow, Bitski, Shopify itself.. yes

But also just open-sourced DIY options like Larva Labs https://t.co/h3Ox9Xy6je"

Provide your community with a curated DTC experience vs asking them to shop wholesale at OpenSea.
