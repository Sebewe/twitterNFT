49,"You have to stay neutral. They are playing favorites. The consequence of not being able to claim copyright safe harbors? Full liability for ALL copyright infringement on your site....good luck with that.

Their legal team needs to step up their game, it's disappointing"
50,"The fact that OS verifies a collection like Invisible Friends that hasn't even launched yet, but fails to verify many other collections with a ton of volume is precisely the stuff you shouldn't do if you want to avoid platform liability under US and EU copyright law."
