1,"#womenhistorymonth started today and I think its important to say that #web3's an inclusive place that is the next step in this movement. Look at the growing female run projects like @BossBeautiesNFT @worldofwomennft  and the powerful women in this space (artists, influencers...)"
2,@its_JustLos I would actually turn the question around. What are the signs that a project is NOT a rug. Anything else and I am probably staying far away.

5,@Degentraland @doodles @BoredApeYC I own both but I just don't see this happening. But you definitely make the point that it has potential to grow tremendously
6,@DEGENIUSeth @BoredApeYC That's so nice of you. If you have a chance I wouldn't mind one of mine. https://t.co/2cYd6nS8yn
7,@TypicalxKiefer I work 9-8 and am so tired. The NFT grind is rough. But I wouldn't give either of it up
8,"@JB__nfts It's just a matter of time until we calculate eth in Kevin's. ""I just found 2 Kevin's in an old wallet"""
9,@Zedd92280738 When I look into those eyes i feel myself giving in. Do not make eye contact!
10,@osf_nft @gnosisSafe @SeanMacAonghais Everyone should listen to this and at least consider whether using a gnosis safe would help them
11,"@AmandaDiGuardia @superplastic @janky @guggimon @therealdayzee @paulbudnitz Have a Janky and Headtripz, wish i had the supergucci"
12,RT @CaptainBuzzApe: Ready to #mint  this #NFT ? https://t.co/9QaAL3Vutn
13,@spaceplusnft @GoZeroG @Astro_Jose When most projects best giveaways are WL spots on other projects in comes Space+ to offer the coolest IRL experience giveaway. Zero G flights for 3. And this is all pre mint and without any commitment other than being a part of the community. Imagine what's in store after mint
14,@MrRobertMurray @BoredApeYC Next Bored NYC meetup is a toga party?
15,"@osf_nft @greatmando_nft @SeanMacAonghais @gnosisSafe Nice, this is an important one. I can't wait to listen"

#BAYC #apefollowape https://t.co/R4SXi5KFLo"
17,@JB__nfts @BoredApeYC @larvalabs @psychedelic_nft @BAYC2745 I love Mount Rushmore conversations. It's obviously to early to tell but I think we add @CoolmanUniverse to that list eventually.
18,We all tell ourselves that we need to be careful about what projects we buy and only buy NFTs that have real long term value. And then Kevin comes along to test our resolve. Must resist... https://t.co/HqRrXkBWLL

21,@weareround21 Does that include holders of the Sket One collab?
22,@weareround21 I am guessing that Lori did not make a deal
23,@weareround21 I have been waiting all season for a Web3 brand to hit Shark Tank. Cannot wait to watch this now
24,@Hackatao There are some who struggle to transition to the reality that Web3 affords us. Do not let those people bring you down. The truly innovative projects (such as your Q+K) will get its due recognition when the hype train projects die because there was no substance behind it
25,@cclccl4461 That is a beauty! Check out @metawatches for a crossover between your two interests
26,"@itsdanataylor Wow, thats a lot of followers when only following 500. Ill follow you back"
27,"Gotta share this song about the NFT world from my buddy the super talented @its_JustLos from @light_wrkz. Super catchy song that captures how we all feel about being an NFT degen. https://t.co/YPGsuk7dEG
I love all the creativity in the Web3 universe, cant get enough of it"
28,The NFT will open up new opportunities for space enthusiasts to interact with astronauts like @Astro_Jose and others. There will be more access to launches from companies like @blueorigin Or @NASA. The NFT can help holders be at the forefront of the journey to the next frontier
29,Cool to see people like @Astro_Jose recognize the importance and utility of NFTs in real life applications. It's not a scam and not just about digital art. @spaceplusnft and @upliftaerospace are using NFTs to help expand access to space exploration to a wider community.
30,"@WutzkeMegan @Astro_Jose @spaceplusnft There's a lot of misunderstanding and bad sentiment around NFTs mostly because of a few bad actors and the way that some people explain what an NFT is. But when done right and NFT is a game changer in terms of ownership rights and rewarding the artists, developers, and supporters"

34,@farokh @RugRadio how do I listen to the 2 episodes about DAOs in full. I am searching for it but can't find
35,@farokh @SyndicateDAO @belikewater893 Can we please get a link to episode 1?
36,I get why everyone on crypto Twitter is focused on how our #NFT and #ETH investments are doing. But there is a bigger picture and my heart goes out to all those suffering because of the #RussiaUkraineConflict.
37,@NFTshawty Stay safe! You and everyone else in #Ukraine
38,Greatest thing about #web3 and the #NFT community is the global nature of it. Made so many friends from around the world in the last year. Today is a reminder that we could use more of that support and coming together as a human race. #Ukraine #Russia
39,@jankyt_ @bricktopians Have 3 of em. One of my favorites to just look at
40,@VirtualElena One of the best threads on Web3 that I've seen. Will be forwarding to all my doubting family and friends
41,"Something tells me that @CoolmanUniverse is about to take off and really enter the realm of ""blue chip"" very soon. No insider info and NFA, just a hunch. Disclosure: I do hold a bunch of Speshies."
42,@SPORE_ONE @tunneymunney @jpegmorganxyz Monkeyfund has 9 total Tunney Munneys right now
43,"@JB__nfts Most importantly, you will learn without being emotionally invested. Because once you start buying you won't be able to remove the emotion from your investment thesis."
44,@JB__nfts Advice: Spend 2-3 months in discords and on twitter following all projects and learning. In that time DO NOT buy a single NFT. You might sacrifice a little in some missed opportunities but my guess is you will save even more in avoiding scams &amp; rugs.
45,@Kyle__Rowe @beaniemaxi Proper etiquette is to share 10% of all winnings with anyone else who's in the bathroom when you hit a jackpot
46,@alexarnault @doodles Welcome to the @doodles fam!
47,@NathanHeadPhoto You only missed out if it doesn't go higher. Otherwise it's not too late. I think all 3 of these have potential to keep going higher
48,@lcfralienss Replace the word art with utility
49,@bayc8925 @BoredApeYC Would be really cool if you could follow every single ape and mutant
50,@OxJB_nft Both share some fault but ultimately when you send your contact info its on you to send it correctly and if there is a typo you should fix it.
51,"7 hours until the Mega Mutant Reveal! Less than 5 hours until the event begins. Just the beginning of these types of events and the power of Web3.  @mutant_cartel @FODLfi @officialboredAi @0x_b1 @BoredApeYC

58,I really enjoyed the analysis and conclusions that @bostonrob__ came to regarding @skuxxverse. If @nftworldsNFT is going to continue to climb (I think it is) then this is a great way to get exposure to $WRLD at a much cheaper entry cost. I just aped in with a few floor passes

60,@_PPMan_ I currently send things between wallets 2 and 3 too often. Need something that allows you to verify without opening up a security hole.
61,@_PPMan_ I basically follow this method (although with a few more wallets sprinkled in) but the question I get asked the most is how do you then verify or enter things that need you to show you own one of those valuables
62,@boxel_eth @BoredApeYC Welcome! This is what it is all about!
63,@Sir_Mensa_ @AmeerHussainn Nifty island @Nifty_Island
64,@Boubzer_ @DiscoverXnft Youre broke but have an ape? Or are you using someone else's ape as your pfp?
65,"@JustinMezzell @tanduyha Or the reverse, you can enjoy things because you like them even if no one around you enjoys those same things"
66,"I badly want to post something about how everyone should stop asking me to promote their projects because I have integrity... But no one has asked me to promote their projects.
I think I have integrity and won't promote things that I don't believe in, just haven't been tested yet"
67,@SnipesNFT @BoredApeYC @GutterCatGang Proud member of the #BAYC here
68,@greatmando_nft I am already spending every minute i have on it. But its also important to have some balance. Burn out is real and with all of the focus on mental health in this space it is important that we keep that perspective
69,@metawatches @Zeneca_33 @ZenAcademy_ Welcome @Zeneca_33 to the metawatch community. We don't want you to be late in the metaverse so now you can tell time to get to all your virtual appointments.

76,Thanks to @MrRobertMurray for arranging an awesome @BoredApeYC NYC meetup last night. This is part of what makes the #BAYC and #MAYC community so cool and should really be highlighted more

81,@mugatu_eth It's kinda remarkable that we all think that it's a possibility that @BoredApeYC will eventually announce it like this.
82,RT @mugatu_eth: Fuck it. $Ape coin Saturday.
83,@svvrth @BoredApeYC I dream of such things. Congrats!
84,@_tyedied @jwleder So important to talk about these things so that others know it can get better and they should seek help. Also happens to be therapeutic for you. Thanks for sharing
85,"@ipano_ipano @BoredApeYC With an ape like that it is perfectly normal.
I remember when I first saw the mutants I was like ""Ew, that looks nasty!"" Now I am looking at them and saying things like ""wow, that one's a beauty"""
86,"@victhorialima Check out @dinobabiesNFT, thank me later."

99,@cobie Thank you for this thread. Definitely something to think about and evaluate with future reward structures. The difference between this and the old way is that in the old way the VCs got all of the rewards where now the users at least get a small share of them.
