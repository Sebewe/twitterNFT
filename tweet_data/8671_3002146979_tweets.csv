63,"@RandomFFUser @justindarc This issue is on Firefox for iOS, which does not support addons. Thanks anyway!"
64,@justindarc Simon Basca's post on Bugzilla perfectly describes the issue. Can we please get this fixed? You shouldn't have to constantly re-enable private browsing.
65,@justindarc This is an annoying bug that turns off private browsing after you force quit the app. Some users want to keep Firefox in private browsing 24/7. It's annoying how the app doesn't remember the setting and throws you back into normal browsing mode.
