LOOK LABS has the ability to implement a dynamic conversion rate at the in-game shop.

A higher conversion rate will increase the in-game burn rate, not only helping to regulate the burn rate, but also guarantee a healthy &amp; sustainable increase of $HIGH on secondary"
5,"🦺Safeguards

Another important notice: LOOK LABS members will be paid in $HIGH. They will have a lock-up period and a linear vesting schedule. This ensures LOOK LABS team-members will be long-term invested into the project."
6,"💰$HIGH LP

Once the game has launched, LOOK LABS will stake 100 OG passes into a treasury vault. 

The estimated value for each pass is at least (but not limited to) 4 ETH. This brings the initially backed-value of the $HIGH token to 400 ETH."
