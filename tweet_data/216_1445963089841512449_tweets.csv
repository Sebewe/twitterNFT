1,"CloneX is still the only project where I’ve seen an immediate increase in value after releasing an airdrop/upgrade, while still growing the community for those that can’t afford a CloneX. Other projects need to take note of what they’re doing because they’re doing it right."
2,"@ImAbvAvg @InvsbleFriends @doodles It’s hard to compare since Space Doodle is still a wrapped Doodle. But I agree with you on utility, Doodle floor is 2x Invisible Friends, so it seems both are reasonable priced?"
3,@ImAbvAvg @InvsbleFriends @doodles I’m trying to understand the logic here because it doesn’t make any sense. Space Doodles are tied to the original Doodle and the floor is above Invisible Friends. What is under/over priced?
4,@MotionMarkus ✅🐐
5,@mrmakerbot @3landersNFT I panic bought more 👀
6,"Great analysis by @mooncat2878. @3landersNFT has so much variety that there will always be something for everyone, but are people going after rarity or aesthetics? https://t.co/Wm33xkpH42"
7,@mooncat2878 @3landersNFT This is a great analysis. I’m personally buying floor to accumulate as many as I can. There’s so much variety in this project that there’s always something for everyone.
8,@FlurETH A lot of liquidity sucked out into new projects
9,Predicted 4-6 ETH floor for IF. People forget that half of WL basically got in for free. Support level seems to be around 5 ETH and we're seeing more consolidation with unique owners dropping from 4.4K to 4.2K since reveal. Maybe not a bad idea to accumulate here. NFA. https://t.co/sw4KfqJBIk

17,"@chibiapegang Exactly. I remember having to explain to people why RTFKT would do well because they had already accumulated a lot from projects before CloneX and a 3 ETH mint was reasonable given their ambitions, but people just see the number and dismiss it."
18,"@chibiapegang The same people that believe NFTs will change the world and produce generational wealth are the same people that will call cash grab if a project trades at 9 early. There are duds for sure, but most people don't do enough research."
19,"@chibiapegang I was just thinking this. When you're around long enough, you see FUD is just a hazing ritual for new projects."
20,@spencermarcus I love this one!
21,Picasso could come back to life and release an NFT with a high price and people would still FUD it out of existence
22,"@Classic_Craig @InvsbleFriends @MotionMarkus @coinbilly_ @ashh_eth I honestly don’t know. So much unnecessary FUD based on the price alone, yet the price is driven by demand because the artist is well known who has influenced so many others and the art is amazing."

30,@dominiks6387 Spot on. I don't want to imagine the amount of friction required to do something like this before crypto. This was what crypto was originally created for and it's good to see it used for an important cause.

32,"@Maverick__23 @3landersNFT @AzukiZen @RTFKTstudios @InvsbleFriends IF will have a PFP maker, but I don’t think blue chips should be limited to good PFPs. Fidenzas don’t make good PFPs, but their floor is 69.5 ETH. I see IF as a collector’s NFT that has potential to become the first “animated” blue chip."

@3landersNFT 👀 - Variety art, mass appeal, next blue chip
@AzukiZen ⛩ - Pushing web3 experiments, unprecedented growth
@RTFKTstudios CloneX 🧬 - Building metaverse, Nike stability
@InvsbleFriends 🧥 - Influential artist, first animated blue chip"
46,"@bobubeanfarmer Bobu about to radically change the high barrier to entry for blue chip projects.

For .01 ETH you can either have a stake in Azuki or mint yet another derivative that will likely go to 0."
47,@benitopagotto @L1lSketchy @crep_eth Fractional flowers 🤯
48,"@famousfxck @InvsbleFriends I was surprised the number of events RCC holds for their community: karaoke nights, talent shows, poker tournaments, etc. And it happens almost every week. All of this isn’t apparent unless you spend some time in their Discord."
49,"tl;dr Low supply traded/listed, more consolidation, and positive ROI for holders

Obviously this could all change after reveal, but it shows holders are not treating mint as a quick flip."
50,"Some positive stats on @InvsbleFriends 

- 10.1K vol traded and avg price of 9.6, ~1K IF traded hands (20% of supply)
- 4487 holders from initial 5000, ~500 wallets added more at current prices
- IF floor is above what was needed to buy 3 SH/MR
- 435 IF listed (8.7% of supply)"

56,"Finding a buyer to buy it in whole is difficult, but piecing it out at a more attainable price is easier. It also allows future stake in the game if you keep pieces for yourself."
57,"The difficulty of owning a grail is the illiquidity that comes with selling it at the right price, but fractionalizing it could be the alternative solution."
58,I expect the price of rares to increase since fractionalization will allow more people to participate in the ownership of a grail with less risk.

65,Holding a 1/1 auction right before mint is low key genius. Say what you will about @InvsbleFriends but they know how to build hype
66,"@Bllzll If I can get in for under 5 ETH, I’m fine if goes up to 9 ETH before reveal 🤝😂"
67,@Classic_Craig @InvsbleFriends If it goes below 3 it’ll get scooped up quick. I don’t think they announced the reveal date.
68,"@famousfxck @InvsbleFriends For sure, but I’m hoping to enter at the right price so I can collect more. Once I secure them though floor won’t matter, this is a great project and long term hold."
69,"I wouldn’t be surprised if it settles around 5-6 ETH prereveal since almost all WL will only be able to mint 1 and there’s only a supply of 5000.

I’ve seen predictions for 10+ ETH floor, but I think that will happen after reveal (could be days or weeks after)."
70,"With 50% WL getting in for free and other 50% paying ~7 ETH (3 SlimHoods/MoodRollers), I’m predicting price will be ~4 ETH.

There will definitely be people that got in for free undercutting and taking profit."
71,Anyone buying @InvsbleFriends on secondary and have a good price prediction prereveal?
72,"@mooncat2878 @antfex @3landersNFT I haven’t seen much FUD about this project and the floor has been holding up well despite being in a macro bearish market.

This should definitely turn around in the next bull run and now is the time to consolidate."

91,"Even with a lot of positive signals, a lot of people may still be hesitant to jump into new projects with poor performances from recent projects.

Regardless, in my opinion, this project is still undervalued and I expect it will take a lot of people by surprise after reveal. https://t.co/r50tqIPlMs"
92,"Volume

3Landers had a smooth and safe launch with a quickly sold out mint. There’s been strong volume post mint with floor rising. Currently, there are 4,700 holders with 5.8K ETH traded before reveal and floor at 1.5 ETH. https://t.co/dOCFtTVuKT"
93,"Community

The 3Land community has grown organically and their Discord is very active. The NFT space is really a community of communities and their appreciation towards other communities have shown how much they value community. https://t.co/y1aB0yzRRT"
94,"Lore

Pom developed 3Land over time and calls it his creative playground. 3Land is the world in which 3Landers (the community) lives in. More will be revealed later, but a lot of artwork has been created to show us what that world looks like. https://t.co/dieOpI1lQ0"
95,"Art

3Landers characters are colorful and fun. There are 12 revealed DNAs each with their unique traits. With the high variety of art, there’s potential for mass appeal. https://t.co/HRKGYK5IB6"

Pom (also known as @3landboy) is a Thai artist from Japan. His story is inspirational and with the rise in Asian influenced NFTs, more Asian artists are starting to get the recognition they deserve. https://t.co/TBUoPuUj2l"
