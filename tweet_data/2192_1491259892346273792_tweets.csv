13,"@InvsbleFriends reveal in a few hours, hope you’re ready @opensea"
14,@AlexStemplewski imo BAYC has a further outlook and will continue to perform well. MAYC will perform good as well I just don’t think they’ll ever keep up with the originals

29,@DiscoverXnft Anyone heard from this dude? He doing well or?
30,@DiscoverXnft Tbh I could be down to purchase at 0.5 eth. If they actual execute on their roadmap then I could be bullish but that’s dependent on them

46,@spencer_lazosky @coinbilly_ @InvsbleFriends The difference in quality is all about what you don’t realize yet they went the extra mile anyways
47,"@StarWarsNFTs Simple answer, if you have the eth then you should definitely scoop a second"
48,"@Pixelmon might be a good scoop between 0.3-0.5, gonna watch this one and see what happens. Not saying Pixelmon isn’t worth more than 0.5, it’s just tough to keep the hype and that amount of eth locked up until they release a game can be a deterrent"
