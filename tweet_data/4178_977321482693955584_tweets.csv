17,"7/ SAFE + Token Warrant (aka side letter)

Investors receive equity in a project, just like a SAFE. 

But they also get a token warrant. 

So when the project launches a token, investors are entitled to buy the tokens (usually at a discount)."
18,"6/ SAFTE (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens or Equity)

Based on SAFT, SAFTE promises investors a discount on a future token sale or equity.

It is said to provide a level of security: If the token sale doesn't occur, equity are to be traded."
19,"5/ SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens)

This is a variation of SAFE. 

It secures the future transfer of digital tokens from startups to investors. 

It essentially uses tokens instead of equity."
20,"4/ SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)

This is the traditional way to raise money with only equity. 

Startups promise them future shares of stock in exchange for their investment today. 

It’s more flexible than priced rounds. 

It was created by @ycombinator."
21,"3/ STOs (Security Token Offerings)

STO is similar to ICOs, but it conforms to regulatory requirements. 

A security token represents an investment contract and carries the ownership information. 

It takes longer to launch an STO because startups need to get regulators on board."
22,"2/ IEOs (Initial Exchange Offering)

In IEOs, crypto startups launch their tokens through an exchange (like Binance) rather than directly to the public. 

To launch an IEO, startups need to create an operational prototype so that investors understand your idea easily."
23,"1/ ICOs (Initial coins offerings)

ICOs originated in 2013. 

The organizer issues tokens and sells to investors.

It’s similar to IPOs (Initial Public Offerings), except that startups use tokens instead of equity."

74,"8/ tokenomics is still new.

and we have a long way to go.

but it brings so much potential.

let's keep innovating to bring more value with tokenomics."
75,7/ @Immutable uses both $IMX tokens and points. https://t.co/kPdlzsvGdk
76,"6/ the value of points depends on the protocol.

it can be used for:
- discounts
- access
- rewards
- governance
- or even ability to earn more tokens

this also provides defensibility as it is native to the protocol and cannot be easily copied."
77,"5.2/ tokens &amp; points

points can be earned directly on the platform.

they cannot be bought and sold so it gives more power to early adopters and power users."
78,"5.1/ tokens &amp; points

tokens can be bought and sold.

this provides financial rewards for users.

it's also owned on the blockchain and can be used to utilities like staking."
79,"4/ how can we prevent this?

we can use a dual system: tokens &amp; points"
80,"3/ but tokens can be bought.

and that means whales can just buy up the majority of tokens.

we've seen this happen before.

all of a sudden, the whales control the protocol."
81,"2/ ideally, early adopters and power users have the most tokens.

so their opinions have the most weight."
82,"1/ tokens have many utilities.

one example is governance.

so token holders can fairly vote on proposals for the protocol."
83,"here's the problem with tokenomics.

whales can just buy up everything.
