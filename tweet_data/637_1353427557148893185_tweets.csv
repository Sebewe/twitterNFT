82,"@Bitcoin_Martian @JeffBooth @oak_knight @priceoftomorrow Loved it - my main response was because I feel dismissing eth is akin to some of the points made in the book, like Polaroid ignoring Kodak then kodak ignoring digital cameras."
83,"@Bitcoin_Martian @JeffBooth @oak_knight @priceoftomorrow Great read, been completely down the bitcoin rabbit hole. https://t.co/LP1I4raNRM"
84,"@Bitcoin_Martian @JeffBooth @oak_knight @priceoftomorrow I’d love to see it! If there’s a way to earn 🌽 directly I’ll be all about it.

What sucks is in the US it seems we are locked out of the cooler features of umbrel marketplace, like the LNMarkets where you can play with futures and leverage with small amounts."
85,"@Bitcoin_Martian @JeffBooth @oak_knight @priceoftomorrow I run an umbrel node, I hope it grows with 🇸🇻 and the other countries using it brother.
I also hope eth fixes their gas fees 😩"
86,"@Bitcoin_Martian @JeffBooth @oak_knight @priceoftomorrow That’s not the argument - I agree bitcoin is a revolution. 

I just don’t subscribe to the kool aid being served that it has to do everything, because it doesn’t right now. I like to trade jpegs, should I wait until it’s built on bitcoin out of ethos?"
87,"@Bitcoin_Martian @JeffBooth @oak_knight @priceoftomorrow I use it extensively, if the argument was gas fees I wouldn’t have even bothered responding.

I’d say the bigger problem is the lack of people building on bitcoin. Everything I hear that sounds viable is Jack and the traditional face of megacorps - where are the builders?"
88,"@Bitcoin_Martian @JeffBooth @oak_knight @priceoftomorrow Sounds great. I’m *not* anti-bitcoin, it’s my savings vehicle of choice.

My issue is no one is doing what you’re proposing, while ethereum is. It’s like saying “your electric car sucks” while building Diesel engines."

ETH is NOT a superior SOV, but... c'mon."
