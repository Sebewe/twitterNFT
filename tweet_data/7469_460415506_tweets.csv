I think red and green #1000+ is priced correctly. Brackets are too"

You don’t pay to put fiat in and to purchase or sell lol. 

You also have lower selling fees depending on your merchant type. In addition, I prioritise £1 selling fees which occurs once a month or two. Your comparison was dry"
78,"@cun @LuisKikeGatica @ecomi_rhys @veve_official @DavidYuNZ @Daniel00077 That’s why cash out fees should be reduced   It’s all about the experience. The teams cost is fuckall. They make millions, stomach the fees. 5% is more than reasonable"
79,@cun @LuisKikeGatica @ecomi_rhys @veve_official @DavidYuNZ @Daniel00077 charging people £1 and $1.20 in the store to grab gems but also requesting a 10% on cash out is literally criminal. Fraud behaviour
