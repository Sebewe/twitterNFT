0,@Arthur_0x The team does keep delivering. LooksRare was the first competitor I thought really had a shot to trade on OpenSea. Seems like old habits die hard for people.. the conversion rates were lower than I expected. Thought for sure compensating users was a silver bullet.
1,"@osmosiszone Game changer for the industry! Keep innovating and leading by example, @osmosiszone 🔥🚀"
2,"Thanks @emilyjones2022 for this apocalyptic-looking edit of my #galaxywarriors by @galaxy_eggs 

It’s going to look 😍 in my @RTFKTstudios’ space and loot pods. https://t.co/ZB7OAPzrvV"
3,@emilyjones2022 @galaxy_eggs Mind sending me a DM? Rather not share publicly :)
4,@emilyjones2022 @galaxy_eggs Would love to add this as artwork in my @RTFKTstudios space pod!
5,"@emilyjones2022 @galaxy_eggs WOW! Absolutely love it 😍, thanks so much, Emily! 

Is there a way I can download it?"
6,"@emilyjones2022 @galaxy_eggs Love your edits, Emily! Any chance you can do something for my Plague warrior? 😍 https://t.co/83wp3CUcLp"
7,Anyone else notice radio music nowadays is basically just an Ed Sheeran playlist?
8,@bolau_ @ajcronk @emerick__mary @Y_Folla @JosephALChami Fixed!
9,"I foresee a core shift in NFT projects being founding teams budgeting out and presenting the costs for their roadmaps. With all the cash grab projects out there, buyers will start expecting more transparency up-front and will avoid unjustifiably high mint prices."
10,"@0xshub Initial sale should reflect the costs projected to realized the roadmap. No way each of these projects need $10M+ for their PFP and merch minimal roadmaps. Pure money grabs. 

Some projects sell out without even having a roadmap… This trend won’t last long."
11,@ajcronk @bolau_ @emerick__mary @Y_Folla @JosephALChami Love this! Let’s do it!
12,"@yobsyobsyobs @RTFKTstudios Sweet! Looking forward to adding it to the pod

Giving back to this amazing #NFTcommunitiy  1 Free ""Jellyfish Night"" piece. 
https://t.co/EgBSlrODfQ
1⃣ Must-Fol…"
15,@jivostudio @sloth_boy_4u this is the artist that made our Figment Warriors ^
16,"@samo1000x @luckyEG8888 @clonexbot Sorry that happened to you, brother :( I got a CloneX stolen from me back in December - fake SudoSwap link. 

It’s a terrible feeling… but eventually you’ll move on. Gotta keep up the hustle - don’t let this stop you.

Good luck!"
17,"@luckyEG8888 @clonexbot Highly, highly likely. The wallet that the original owner transferred to seems unavailable on OS. Generally happens when they flag/blacklist a wallet."
18,"@Dylanc_NFT @AzukiZen @opensea_support They said turnaround time is generally a few days, but they have a ton of incoming emails. 

Last time I emailed OS, it took 1 month for a response... I'm hoping it's a quicker turnaround this time."
19,"@Dylanc_NFT @AzukiZen Ignore this scammer, @Dylanc_NFT ^

You can find the contact page through the OpenSea website. Do not trust anyone’s emails or links on Twitter."
20,"@Dylanc_NFT @AzukiZen I emailed @opensea about it and sent them the series events with screenshots, etc. I'm hoping they approach this on a case-by-case basis and un-flag those that were purchased by legitimate buyers."
21,"@Dylanc_NFT @AzukiZen @Dylanc_NFT you can technically still sell it on LooksRare or another marketplace. It just means you can't sell it on OpenSea unless they remove the flag.

I foresee this being a consistent issue when people buy on other marketplaces that then see it's blocked on OpenSea."
22,"I'm proud to be an owner of an @AzukiZen, let alone a Gold trait. Just wish it didn't happen like this... 

Sorry to all those who lost their NFTs, as well as the buyers who are now unable to sell - We are all victims here."
23,@opensea - please remove the Suspicious Activity flags. You are not protecting anyone with this approach. All you are doing is punishing the buyers. The only one that wins is the scammer who stole and sold the NFT.
24,"Not only do I feel guilty for the purchase, but @opensea flagged all stolen NFTs as ""Reported for Suspicious Activity"" - meaning the NFT cannot be listed, sold or offered on.

This is extraordinarily unfair for buyers who did nothing wrong."
25,"Now I can't help but feel like I have ""blood on my hands"", despite having done nothing wrong.

I've reached out to the original owner (@AJFromDiscord) to try to find a solution. Unless @opensea considers reimbursing buyers of the stolen NFTs, there isn't much that can be done."
26,"Feeling bitter sweet about acquiring this Gold-trait #Azuki..

I had put in offers on all gold traits Saturday morning. In the early evening, the phishing scam fiasco happened, wallets were drained and the scammer sold the stolen NFTs on @opensea.

My existing offer was accepted. https://t.co/c0SCsRW9ar"
27,@YannickCrypto @the_x2y2 Appreciate you 🙏
28,"@YannickCrypto @the_x2y2 If you revoked the collections, is there still a risk?"

30,@RTFKTstudios Can you post (historically and going forward) what the solution was to the quests/missions?
31,@RTFKTstudios Can you provide summaries as to what needed to happen to achieve Quests/Missions?

33,"@RemiMarenco @TheLostGlitches What fake surprises? What random drops? 

Anything TLG has delivered or worked on to date has been on their roadmap for ages. Nothing fake, nothing random.

They are rewarding community members through more artwork and building the game.

Keep up the great work @TheLostGlitches"
34,@SuperFarmDAO Finally! This hush hush business is so not web3. Never seen such little transparency in a project… hoping it’s actual AAA quality and has been worth the wait.
35,@Y_Folla Relatable for sure
36,"This is what a powerhouse partnership looks like! 

Looking forward to seeing @Figment_io and @Ledger work closely together and having Ledger’s clients benefit from access to #staking across many, many PoS networks. https://t.co/uOBi9yVgpj"
37,"@MetaframeNFT Take your pick! Some 🔥 projects: @GalaxyFight_NFT, @TheLostGlitches, @worldofwomennft, @BossBeautiesNFT, @doodles 

Many to chose from with passionate holders who would love to see their NFTs displayed."
38,@cozywyatt Curious 🧐
39,@jivostudio Is it going to be animated? 🙂
40,"@lorientree I’d trust @BMehleisen or @JosephALChami, otherwise no chance."
41,"I foresee high-quality 3D animation becoming an NFT trend in 2022 and onwards. 

Once NFT-compatible frames become cheaper and more accessible, people will want more than just still images.

52,"Unexpectedly joined the @doodles fam today, securing Doodle #390🌈

Appreciate the incredibly warm welcome from the #doodle community; wholesomeness was evident right away - a contrast to other projects fixated on floor price.

56,"I'll say it again - @GalaxyFight_NFT is by far one of the most undervalued and slept-on #NFT and #P2E projects.

GFC WILL be a top game-type NFT collection.

Seed with many credible funders✅

78,@SlimezNFT All good. Gotta be quicker on the draw next time.
79,@SlimezNFT My transaction was processing. Someone sniped it before my transaction went through. So spent gas on a failed transaction
80,@SlimezNFT Been waiting. Someone beat me to it.
81,@SlimezNFT Ugh failed transaction. Waste of ETH :(

86,"@MetaframeNFT @galaxy_eggs @gal_barkan @larvachads Sorry for all the questions - would we have to send back the frame to have new NFTs added or it can be uploaded remotely? 

If all of these questions are addressed somewhere, let me know where and I’d be happy to give it a read"
87,@MetaframeNFT @galaxy_eggs @gal_barkan @larvachads That’s great to hear! Would they have to be pre-selected or they can be changed/added to over time?
88,@MetaframeNFT @galaxy_eggs @gal_barkan Will future iterations of MetaFrame allow for more than one NFT being shown on display? Would be great to be able to cycle through a roster of NFTs!
89,"My first crypto/staking meme! Based on a very true story 🧠:
#STAKING #cryptomemes https://t.co/mFIkg72sYx"
90,"@maxhayart Note though that LR is still far from a final product. It’s building and implementing over time, rather than having waited for a complete product before shipping. 

It’s also Ethereum-only. I’d think a cross-network marketplace with an incentive system will be the winner."
91,"@maxhayart That’s what OpenSea is missing. OS feels like a Web2 company. If they don’t implement a similar reward mechanic to LR, I think it’ll be their downfall."
92,"@maxhayart Number of listings is much higher on OpenSea. If there are as many listings on LooksRare as OpenSea, then yeah, especially if you earn rewards for doing so. 

Part of what makes blockchain tech so powerful is the incentive systems that get all parties to act in unison.."
93,"@maxhayart I like the ability to put in an offer across a whole collection. Saves a ton of time if looking to make offers on floors.

Also have made quite a significant % return from staking my $LOOKS. Focus on giving back to the users is a huge incentive.

Overall like it so far!"
