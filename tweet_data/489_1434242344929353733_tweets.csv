4,We are at the point now in “Twitterland” where posts showing solidarity with Ukraine get met with reminders that Ukraine isn’t perfect or worse.  Social media at it’s finest. 👍
5,It’s beautiful to see this community come out and give.  @lurklovesyou incredible artist donating to @Ukraine_DAO https://t.co/3qG0JyJl7E

8,"Recommended listening.  #Zuckerberg is controversial to many and though I’ve never been a fan of ⁦@Meta⁩ I appreciate hearing his thoughts.  Web3 and the Metaverse are here to stay, no doubt, but can it fulfill it’s promises? https://t.co/WuKY06584B"

11,@SynysterGates They also figured out that I have had sex at least twice in my life.
12,@Tallywood https://t.co/sNbUc1GPBY
13,The kids cornered me about sex after they saw some stuff on the internet… so we had the talk.  Now at dinner they have asked me over 10 times if I’m gonna do it with Mom tonight. They think it’s absolutely hilarious.  🤦‍♂️
14,@Vengenz1 Thanks for this.  Great feed.
15,Take two soldiers from opposing sides and put them in any other situation and they would most likely find themselves friends.  Tragic.
16,"Got the @DeathbatsClub website updated.  We will slowly roll out features as they get done.  Tablet / Wallet, redemptions and gamification coming soon.  If you find bugs please let us know in the discord.        https://t.co/l1yqyx0qvN"
17,"@_TheSophieRose Taking control from 3rd party intermediaries…. DAO’s which give the little guy (uncredited investors) a chance to participate in properties or investments they would otherwise get denied from…. Yep, this is the battle they wanna have. 🤦‍♂️"
18,@Pacolrd09 Il n'y a pas de réponse à cela... vous n'avez clairement aucune idée... bonne chance.
19,@Pacolrd09 Rien de tout cela n'avait de sens. Quelle promesse vous avons-nous faite ? 150$ nfts dans un club à vie c'est cher ?
20,@Zackreyna182 @DeathbatsClub @TheOfficialA7X 100%.  They will say we were selling cute bat art and nothing else… but NOW nfts have a purpose.  🤦‍♂️
21,@Pacolrd09 jetez-nous à la poubelle pour essayer de rendre le monde meilleur pour les artistes et les fans 🗑
22,To be clear I’m saving it based on the down votes and comments. They are…..interesting

51,"So grateful to spend time w our friends and family watching these warriors battle it out.  Incredible game.  @JoeyB is a stud and the @Bengals should be proud.  Sports bring people together no matter your race, sex or politics.  Congrats LA.  Be safe out there tonight. 🔥"

55,@JukayHsu @MikeMcDonald89 @obj @coinbase @SoFiStadium Thats funny. I have 7 punks and 2 v1’s.   I want the classic punk of this as well.  Saw she is for sale
56,"So far we got an @obj touchdown, meta and @coinbase commercials and Hail to the King being played at @SoFiStadium between downs.  Lfg!  Great game.  Hope everyone is good. 🔥"

59,"Was thinking about the @RamsNFL playing at home today but in reality… no season ticket holders get their seats, the electricity of @hurricanenita jamming and the announcer pumping up the crowd will be absent.  All thats left is Sofi Stadium without the soul.  Who you got? https://t.co/rLH4LapMfD"

62,@SynysterGates @DeathbatsClub Seriously… this is incredible
63,@sevenhog We should hold off on judgement because don’t know who or why they bought it.  Maybe it will be cool?
64,"@Satoshi0300 I’m sure that though the buyer has plenty of money, problems still exist in his/her life.  The grass always seems greener but none of us make it out of here alive."
65,"@BenBarn03464105 Free… remember, there was no market for this… just a total experiment of using smart contracts on ethereum.  One of the first use cases.  Thats why they go for so much.  They represent more than an image."
66,@fruiiiii Where are you seeing that?  If its “offer” then that means it was his price.  “Bid” is from a buyer.
67,@Satoshi0300 I would only say I know 7 zombie owners and one punk ape owner… those go for 5-10 million a piece and they 100% are not money laundering.  I think some people are just extremely rich and find the value in the “first” blockchain collectables.
68,@BarefootMudder @TheOfficialA7X @DeathbatsClub @SynysterGates @drinkswjohnny Scam
69,@Satoshi0300 I think money laundering would be done w a less obvious purchase.  Believe it of not some people have this sort of disposable income

71,"@GuitarGuyHaner I think all sides in politics have better arguments then believing an imaginary bad guy is rollin around eating souls… or worrying about if people worship imaginary good and bad guys…. You can’t make this shit up… well, I guess you can 😜"
72,"@GuitarGuyHaner Imagine thinking Satan is real… ok, I’ll see myself back to nft twitter. 😈"
73,@rainnwilson Agree!  Thats why I won’t read any news on the interweb. I buy the physical newspaper to hold the words in my hand to make sure it’s real and then store them in my closet.  Finally someone gets it!

83,@iiqtkimii @Vengenz1 @MrBeast I’ll let you know when it happens 😜
84,@dhundley1986 @MrBeast Yeah. Haha
85,My kids just ran around the house screaming for 15 min. high-fiving because they got a “Golden Ticket” to meet @MrBeast .  Dad read the ticket and let them know they actually just won a box of chocolate.  That’s life kids! 😩😜💁🏻‍♂️
86,"@Vol4life123 @SynysterGates @garyvee I can go back and forth all day w examples of every use case but I’d rather not… it’s healthy to be skeptical, just don’t dig your heels in too deep.  Here is a small example. Have a good one 🤝 https://t.co/EynCXJjbjL"
87,"@Vol4life123 @SynysterGates @garyvee NFT is a broad term… it will be the deed to your house, game skins and avatars, art, concert tickets and membership to clubs… why? Because blockchain is more reliable and more efficient then all other options at the moment.  It gives control to the owners like never before."
88,@Vol4life123 @SynysterGates @garyvee did not say that.  She did.  Gates is commenting on the fact that her narrative is that Wp and money laundering run rampant in NFT’s.  Gates is simply saying her angle is wrong and that Gary did a good job keeping it in perspective.
89,"@Vol4life123 @SynysterGates You didn’t ask a question.  You made a lazy statement.  Its like me saying… “show me how small businesses arent used for money laundering”. You can’t because while most small businesses don’t, they surely can.  The same way you can launder money w fiat…I fail to see your point"
90,@jamesvader1212 @theDeenoBambino @SynysterGates @garyvee Thats why to get early access we had a “WHITElist”.  Duh.  Nft standard
91,@Vol4life123 @SynysterGates I think you need to specify… are you saying that nfts are only or mostly use for money laundering?  More so then anything else we have in society?
92,"@SynysterGates @Immolearn Honestly, someone sent me this video and I watched all 2 hours.  You would have to stop it every 5 min to refute all the falsities.  Total hit piece and allows people that don’t understand the tech to pile on because they simply don’t know better.  Not worth a rebuttal imo"
93,@SynysterGates Oh boy… kudos to @garyvee for not walking out.  White Supremacy 🤦‍♂️
94,@MoshTalksBeez @WickedCraniums @reckless_labs @WickedDoob @WickedDerb 😂😂😂
