1,Tis the season to be pudgy @Pudgy_Penguins https://t.co/sGVIymochU
2,@MrTopStep I’d love one! Thank you
3,@MrTopStep I don’t think it’s right to back trade on Twitter. If you actually caught it then please let us know in advance. Ps - I respect your work. Thanks!

6,@aukiman Indeed it is! Thanks for pointing out. Some people are shameless…..

10,@YoPierreNFT hello frends
11,@jebus911 super solid. really does feel like a BAYC in the making.
12,New profile picture 😜
13,@NFTmachine Wow shocking. What were they expecting ?
14,@NFTmachine How is that possible? If the “operator” account is opensea SC then only the owner (and OS) can initiate a transfer (as per ER721). Unless they’ve done their own thing as well on the MC SC
15,@screentimes Treat em mean keep em keen?
16,@daniel100eth Glad that the cats making people rich
17,@screentimes Lol this tweet isn’t gonna age very well friend
18,NFT bull market is back on thanks to mooncats 🚀
19,@NFTmachine You forgot the famous one: there’s 15k of them 😂
20,@BiZzy_BlocKs @NFTmachine Hes totally smashed it kudos to him. But a wise man once said don't count your chickens. Especially in picture land. Hope all this news checks out.
21,@NFTmachine hey million $ Q: Will mooncats be big enough to save the rest of our worthless pictures?
22,@BiZzy_BlocKs @NFTmachine haha 'us' - yes we need NFTmachine to support our dogshit jpegs once hes made his billions selling mooncats to billionaires
23,@heybentan Pudgy penguins (culture) and mooncats (history)
24,@jebus911 Bot buy doge whenever EM tweets 🚀
25,@penguin_curator It’s not too late
26,@jebus911 Next time just order online duh 🤦🏻‍♂️
27,@NFTmachine I love how you’d rather do mooncats/ETH instead of just saying mooncats in USD 😂
28,@NFTmachine If 20s are the 70s then we have 10years to buy jpegs because inflation will peak in 2030 😂🚀
29,@NFTmachine There will be some (market induced) pain first before we reach this agreement to accept 70s inflation. Either way I feel sorry for anyone owning government debt. You make 1% or lose your capital. Bon chance.
30,@NFTmachine For sure they will try their best. “Transitory” is today’s excuse. What about after 2y of 5%+ inflation? With Rs in control post mid terms.. spicy
31,@NFTmachine What about option 3: bonds blow up because they can’t print money to buy the bonds because inflation has blown up. GG
32,@NFTmachine When mooncats are priced properly we will be long gone friend
33,@iceking0x That price is pure FUD friend!
34,@TheShamdoo dont give us false hope please thanks
35,@NFTmachine Wow wow looks so cute
36,"@DeFiGod1 Great idea - unfortunately you will run into SEC issues. As soon as you earn yield, the NFT becomes a security which will make it all impossible to do legally."
37,@NFTmachine Your sample size is small. Ie I’ve had the opposite experience
38,@heybentan Don’t flatter yourself USDSOL fell more 😂
39,@Dennis_Porter_ It’s far better than owning a bitcoin 🤦🏻‍♂️
40,@NFTmachine What if I’m still a child? 🤔
41,@xincdoteth We might be working for the same major bank 😂
42,@xincdoteth I think you ll find lots of us are in similar shoes!
43,@ASvanevik How would you do it though? What guarantees that “your” nft reflects the real physical one?
44,"@_krutches technically speaking, what actually happens? how does opensea know you've unwrapped your WETH (and potentially spent it!) ? or they dont now? 😱"
45,@ColeThereum Transaction costs are very prohibitive for flipping. Odds are massively against you. Unless you have loads of high quality info and you know what you’re doing
46,"@martelli @heybentan Thank you for your gracious admission. Indeed it takes time. Easiest money is diamond handing blue chips in a bull matket. What nfter does is the HARDEST way to make money. takes time, skill, discipline, courage, capital to beat transaction costs and profit"
47,@xincdoteth flipping is the hardest thing to do. Mainly because transaction costs are brutal
48,@martelli @heybentan Why are you still using 0n1 on your twitter profile 😜
49,@heybentan @martelli i would just say... jealousy is a sickness - get well soon friends :)
50,"@martelli @heybentan People have difference strategies/goals. For me I plan to diamond hand what I believe in (with money I don’t need) and trade around big cycles. Nfter is a flipper. He benefits the market by providing liquidity, education, due diligence. Why so many haters is truly baffling"
51,@martelli @heybentan Why is it shameful to sell? Floor or not. He can do whatever he wants. As a pudgy penguin “believer” - I was happy to see him offloading his penguins because next time there will be less resistance on the move higher. And it will be more organic.
52,@maonini_ Wow wow itth jutht tho pretee 🤩🤩 excuse my penguin English noot noot
53,@maonini_ No - it should be a penguin not an ape
54,@darthvdrtrdr @ColeThereum whats not a penguin?
55,@ColeThereum How about a penguin ser? 😂
56,"RT @fineJPEGs: In this #NFT analysis thread, I'm going to share what I've learned by going to about ~$1 million* in #NFTs after starting 3…"
57,Fun fact: pudgy unique holders are going UP despite the indiscriminate selling🤔
58,@mishanya337 @superbunniesnft not financial advice:)
59,@mishanya337 @superbunniesnft FYI i have 2 (at 0.5 and 0.2)
60,@a1i86 @jebus911 oh dear....
61,@mishanya337 couple of bunnies not a bad shout
62,Good volumes in pudgies. Who's brave enough to catch the falling knife at 2 eth? Fun fact: less than 400 penguins (out of 9k) between 2 and 4 eth.....
63,I would rather go broke than be shamed on discord for selling an #NFT for a 50% loss. This shit sticks - transactions history lives forever 😅 #NFTCommunity
64,@Shadow_Nft @Pudgy_Penguins What a trade. Well done and welcome to the penguin family
65,@jebus911 question is - will the owners of the penguins benefit if such a deal happens?
66,@jebus911 Pudgy massive candidate for licensing esp with all the memes. Much better than punks (even though they signed the deal).
67,@NFTLlama well done
68,@iamDCinvestor Generally it has paid to go in small and accumulate on dips. then you just have to wait.
69,@iamDCinvestor This is terrible for the asset class. You can’t trade jpegs like stock futures ugh
70,@BiZzy_BlocKs @dogeforce_1 @DEMChicksNFT We could set standards such as open source. Code reviews by the community.
71,"@amgma2211 @farokh @jebus911 When the liquidity bubble pops, all assets will collapse. Until then, the party keeps going. At least NFTs offer asymmetric risk/reward. Unlike S&amp;P 500."
72,"@BiZzy_BlocKs @dogeforce_1 @DEMChicksNFT we need a way to establish standard code of conduct for NFTs, and properly vet every NFT project. It could make a huge difference."
73,@ColeThereum Good afternoon from the Pudgy outpost in England!
74,@412_Crypto @MrCryptling @Pudgy_Penguins wow what a group! good afternoon PENGUINS
75,@pranksy Million dollar question: did mr hacker cover the gas fee yes or no?
76,@jebus911 we need it to be more legit. i.e. you have to upload pfp from your wallet..
77,"@basedkarbon re liquidity, they're far more liquid than comparable assets i.e. contemporary art"
78,@basedkarbon non fungible is the beauty of nfts. plenty of fungible assets out there thanks to banks making everything a security.
79,@HarlemChad @jebus911 @Pudgy_Penguins welcome to the huddle!
80,@jebus911 Good afternoon from ENGLAND pengus https://t.co/2zkkIJhFoC
81,@MaxEtherETH @pranksy @opensea Either way it’s a good trade. If it’s real you could make 50-100x. If someone hacked the banksy website you will lose 1x. If we never find out … you might make even more!
82,@heybentan Good on you. Setting the standards 🚀
83,@levi_alterman Greater fool theory is the sole reason behind buying any asset on earth at current valuations. Including trillion dollars companies. At least risk reward on NFTs is compelling.
84,@pranksy One thing for sure - whoever gets it will make loads of money. Very few know about it. The “rich rich” might not even know how to transact. 3 days only.
85,@pranksy @opensea Its still gonna go for 100s of ETH!
86,@3dPudgypenguin hey bud - looking to 3D a couple of penguins - how much would it cost? Thanks
87,"RT @ricburton: A bunch of NFT investors go get dinner

One of them orders a steak

It arrives and they all look at each other knowingly

“L…"
88,@jebus911 People are also quite cautious (tongue in cheek) lol imagine they weren’t ……
89,@UnivrslSoldier4 @jebus911 What? 😥
90,Respect to the @Pudgy_Penguins @ColeThereum team for a FLAWLESS airdrop. Clean move in a space which can be very difficult to get right the first time. #PudgyPenguins
91,@loomdart You’re giving them too much credit. They are printing money (which causes liquidity to flow to new assets)  because they have to.
92,@412_Crypto @Pudgy_Penguins Looks rare!!!
93,@cryptoNFTsniper That’s because SOL has done 4x 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
94,@jebus911 You mean trying to execute a transaction on opensea?
95,@NFTmachine Maybe I’m stupid but don’t they have to implement all the functions of the ER721 standard? how are they restricting that? Thank you
96,@0xA1Z36 @Pudgy_Penguins @jebus911 @EtheriaChan @FP053 @0xElm0 @MaxieRyan What’s a poached ser?
97,@ShardiB2 I think that will maximise your risk because most NFT projects fail. Transaction costs are also high. Top traders go big on good projects and HODL #NFT
98,@cupkitten very much touched by your story - I can relate because I was born in a similar developing country (same stories). Wish you the best of luck. I will definitely be buying in.
99,@christianchin88 That’s fair - no one got poor taking profits!
