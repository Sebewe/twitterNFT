1,@AltcoinPsycho That is one subtle bear post
2,@ChainlinkComfy No I don’t think that’s bad either
3,"@ChainlinkComfy A government knowing every single transaction you make and being able to regulate how you spend your money is horrifying to me, especially after seeing the debacle in Canada. But you’re right, cbdc’s are coming and we need to deal with it."

6,@AyeItsJoel Ohhhh you got so lifted you became an alien again
7,@NFTmachine You can learn it in five minutes on YouTube.  The hard part is drawing hundreds of layers.  As someone heading an nft project I can tell you the work is insane.  I do 12 hours a day 6 days a week. We’re not a pfp project though.

21,@ribsauce Dude literally was praising Putin like two days ago
22,@inversebrah Imagine not blaming the guy who sided with Russia for his entire four years
23,@cryptomandate Lol
24,@ribsauce You put Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt in a blender and you’ve got my ideal President.
25,@ribsauce 🤝
26,@TPalms_ @TylerSCrypto Are you convinced we aren’t some mad scientist’s toy project? Civilization in a digital Petri dish? Bc I’m not 🤷🏻‍♂️ small likelihood but statistically possible.  Also could be Boltzmann brains floating in the vacuum which would explain the lack of logic the world is demonstrating.
27,"@ribsauce Another gun loving, woke hating liberal, nice to see. Basically I want a European style social safety net with maternity leave, healthcare, etc but with American style political incorrectness and guns."
28,@cryptobrickz I guess if our inflation is way less than everyone else’s we win? 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
29,@CryptoGrills Tiny parts of Ukraine belonged to Russia at some point but this is an invasion of the entire country.  It would be like if mexico said Texas belonged to them so they invaded Texas and also every state in the country.
30,"@CryptoGrills Wth are you talking about, Ukraine isn’t part of Russia and never has been?! California is the United States.  I don’t see the smallest shred of parallel. But you’re entitled to your opinion."
31,"I’m not sure if it’s a desire to be edgy or sincere but people making false equivalencies between Putin and the west are either naive, stupid, or both.

This is a black and white issue; an invasion of a sovereign nation with no legitimate reason."
32,"@CryptoGrills 🤦🏻‍♂️ this is an event where a leader unilaterally invaded a European country with a completely fabricated excuse “denazification”

The only similar and almost recent circumstance was Iraq two decades and three presidents ago.  You’re off base."
33,@CryptoGrills When is the last time any western nation invaded another western nation unprovoked. Stop with your false equivalencies.

65,@bourne2invest @thelonelyaliens Oh hello https://t.co/GEPw5gYPBo
66,@ieatbitcoin @jay_snowdon @Alaina33554640 That goes against reality.  Putin has said in the past he doesn’t recognize the sovereignty of the Baltic states or finland.  You’re a Russian troll or spoon fed military grade propaganda.
67,"RT @cclccl4461: I don’t care if you were ACTUALLY hacked or if you lost your eth/NFTs through user error, I’m so sorry. You’re the victim h…"
68,You ever vibing and then remember something super embarrassing you did like a decade ago
69,"@jay_snowdon Yea it’s wild - especially considering they’re extremely Catholic and Biden is a devout Catholic and trump is….not.

The abortion issue really takes priority for some people and skews their interpretation of every other issue.  Also shows the power of PiS propaganda."
70,@jay_snowdon Sounds like my in-laws and the way they feel about trump.  No matter what he did for putin he was their savior and biden is selling them out to the Russians.
71,@jay_snowdon Oh lord 🤦🏻‍♂️
72,@jay_snowdon 85% approval rating -___-
73,@stevefink Proper take
74,@jay_snowdon @ieatbitcoin @Alaina33554640 It’s actually terrifying.  I married into a polish family and they’ve never touched guns until the pst year or two.  People who can afford it are arming themselves because they believe the Russians will be there sooner rather than later.
75,@jay_snowdon Hopefully their leaders are equally punished as well.  especially for the civilians they murdered in massacres like the ms Estonia.

78,@ieatbitcoin @jay_snowdon @Alaina33554640 If you’re a citizen of the free world you should probably feel a little more strongly about the attempted rebirth of the Soviet Union 🤷🏻‍♂️ my family in Eastern Europe certainly is.
79,"It’s pretty odd that despite the growth of the crypto space bitcoin dominance never reached the lows of 2017.  The narrative of bitcoin growing less important over time seems to have been incorrect, unless the cycle isn’t over"

82,"@GarethSoloway Flush out the scams and cash grabs, leave the space to the builders, and let smart money accumulate. Kind of love to see it."
83,"@AyeItsJoel For real, I have something burning a hole in my wallet but I’m scared to interact with the new contract.  Is it definitely phishing or what?"
84,@nayibbukele “Freedom” to be ultra right wing christian?
85,@SleezeCoin Couldn’t agree more
86,@SleezeCoin Every week in NFTs there’s something else they could make a whole movie about.
87,"The behavior of the hacker is illogical so questions arise:

1) what entity stands to gain the most from Opensea’s misfortune

2) have any of Opensea’s competitors engaged in or encouraged unethical behavior in the past

Interested to see how this plays out"
