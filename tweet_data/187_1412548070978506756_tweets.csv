/fin"

By building a connected multiverse with rich characters &amp; deep storyline that inspire the imagination, spark creativity and make you want to add to the story for the sake of experiencing it with everyone else.

Oh and a network of Hollywood connections going back a decade+"
57,"WHY
This is a big one. Because the foundation of web3 is empowering creators, collectors, builders - EVERYONE to own their assets. Myth Division is building its foundation on empowering YOU to be a part of the MD universe. You get to build and add to the story and brand."
58,"WHEN
It's been non stop since last summer. Orangurock now, BASYC #0, #1 and the animated #1.5
@WaifuWarriors_ drop, now potions, companions, weapons and a contract upgrade all this quarter. Physical comics dropping this spring, more BASYC too, 2 new PFP projects this year"
59,"WHERE
Sandbox, unreal engine 5, 3D avatars fully rigged for anything your favorite hyped project thinks it is ready for, your local comic ship, your favorite streaming platform, it's all either already here, or on its way."
60,"WHAT
Comics, animation, movies, video games, world building, storytelling, character creation, eyeball melting fun, creator empowerment. 

They've literally done it all for years and are STILL doing it."
61,"WHO
@RamonGovea @Superneal @Nicole_Rio_ 
Doxxed founders with track records of creating way back when web3 was wen3 - Building and creating/curating IP content all over instantly recognizable Hollywood tv/movies/games"
