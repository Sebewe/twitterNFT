4,@SCGA21 @HodlerSpot @crispylines Yeah it was a typo mate. Regardless most of the fun stuff with Bitcoin happened before Silk Road. There used to be free 1btc faucets on the web so people used it like Monopoly money
5,if you can’t code with windows buying a macbook isn’t going to help
6,@crispylines typo on 2005 but im leaving it so I can see how many people google and tell me I’m satoshi
7,@HodlerSpot @crispylines Typo but I’m leaving it for the thrill
8,@crispylines welcome to 2005 bitcoin. i went back to my old txns and found out I got 3 oz for about 1.8 mill
9,@liloldhead @AB84 @boredpunksnft it’s almost like people realize sports and celebrity endorsements mean fuck all. especially when they tweet the copy that tells them what to tweet instead of the actual copy
10,@financebuzz 1. sit on a piano pretending you’re unique for a bag of ground beef and a $5 token to chunky cheese
11,@pugson if I could get paid to shit post I would try to join the team. unfortunately outside molecular cancer biology that’s my only talent
12,ok. how do I use tezos?
13,"@hotgirlwithNFTs i think we have to unfortunately. both the groundbreaking, absolutely innovative art form…plus there’s that tv show"

17,@seattletimes Anyone saying we shouldn’t do this can’t read. It’s only against state run companies and those large enough to be controlled by the oligarchs. This does not punish the “normal citizen” of Russian
18,@drewcoffman Nice! I just built the bottom one but it was kinda sorta a kit https://t.co/yQJvTXBcUh
19,@toadswiback do you have the stl file? no reason
20,@mikedemarais oh you’re a ukraine fan? name their top 5 latitudes and longitudes
21,@RAnSacks That’s awesome. My city does our composting but I’ve been thinking about getting my own spinning barrel. Might be too cold in Seattle though

35,"@alexisohanian is there any mechanic to reclaim a subreddit? For example, the oldest mods aren’t active any longer so the next tier in age are ruining it. I feel like there had to be a vote system or something built in at the beginning."
36,@papacthulu can you dm me pls? this isn't about a project or blockchain or anything like that.
37,@ParikPatelCFA i bet he's still bitter about them trying to rip him off of on the rockets way back when he was starting spacex
38,@xuannu_eth i'm playing on pc so it does have some stuttering issues but they've been patching quickly. game itself is a 9/10 if you're into that style of game. i would change it to 10/10 if the stuttering hadn't caused a few deaths.

50,@brady_rattmer @theNFTdude @rubeo @RottenBeach @HOWLERZNFT Right. It means that artificial scarcity is being pushed by the dev. Literally ruining the space and scamming
51,@davidmryder @TheNeedling It’s artisanal from organic fed free range dinosaurs.
52,@Ace_saidit @cnnbrk @amanpour @cnni @CNNnewsroom @CNN My point is that you’re just like a politician. You want other people to go die but you won’t go fight for yourself. Hypocritical and pathetic. Not responding again
53,@Ace_saidit @cnnbrk @amanpour @cnni @CNNnewsroom @CNN You speak ignorant. Nothing is stopping you from going to Ukraine to fight.
54,@VCBrags This is real. They were fired after.

60,"@Secti0n31 @cnnbrk There are 144 million people living in Russia. They will not charge them all. More than half of their country is against the war and protesting. That’s how you change their govt, not by bombing and killing innocents."
61,@HistoryInNFTs @worldofwomennft Sorry. I’ve already won all 80eth in prizes because I have 2 entries
62,@andy8052 People like this should be ostracized and sued for blatant scams. They’re ruining the space for a measly 1.5m
63,@worm_emoji I just hope the US print isn’t done cheaper than the other
64,@Secti0n31 @cnnbrk It’s not just ceremonial. At some point the Russian citizen has to stand up to their leaders. This is a push in that direction without directly hurting citizens
65,@Ace_saidit @cnnbrk @amanpour @cnni @CNNnewsroom @CNN Nothing is stopping you from going. People are tired of being the world police. You go.
66,@lowe_marcus @GovInslee @POTUS @NATO How about we quit using dead dinosaurs to power our lives?

83,@DocStockie @GooseyGran @seattletimes You’re just trolling for blocks. Got it. I really was genuine about why you support him so strongly but you can’t iterate one point. Have a good one.
84,@MarkTheHabibi I like the jiggly rectangle link on your linktree
85,@damedoteth I would be happy with a regular follow 🥺
86,"@DocStockie @GooseyGran @seattletimes Serious question, I’m not trolling. Why are you always vehemently defending him? What is it about him that you like? Is it just “he’s better than Inslee?” Is it the best choice out of the bunch? Why Culp?"
87,"@DocStockie @GooseyGran @seattletimes Regardless if you feel Culp is better for the state, you know he’s tainted beyond recovery and isn’t up to the job in any capacity. Find someone that is, it doesn’t matter if he’s more left or right or center. Why waste your effort on someone like him?"
88,"@DocStockie @GooseyGran @seattletimes I’m not a fan of Inslee, Culp, the Republican or Democrat party. It’s ok to feel that way. You don’t have to root for someone like it’s a sports team. Find a better person for the job and help their campaign from the ground up."
89,"@DocStockie @GooseyGran @seattletimes No I’m serious. Who is he to you and what’s with the worship? As a grown man/human I can’t imagine why you have this worship you’ve put into another grown man. I definitely don’t understand why anyone would worship a politician, much less a man that can’t deliver on any promise."
90,@hotgirlwithNFTs I keep seeing people post that they tested positive after returning. It definitely was.
91,@farokh You’re lucky you got 5 for existing
92,"@seattletimes You already had to fix the poor title once then you post an even worse version. Really, why say “by up to 15%”? That’s lazy writing. “…increase by 1.5% to 15%” makes much more sense."
