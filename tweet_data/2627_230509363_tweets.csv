48,This week I spoke in several diverse women led spaces that gave me so much life! 🙌🏾 I adore all the other women in Web3 making impact and onboarding new people into the space despite the challenges that come with being underrepresented / feeling invisible at times. I see you!❤️

69,"I was reppin Web3 tonight at my aerial dance class. Woo! #WorldOfWomen was one of the first NFTs I collected last year and remains one of my favorite projects. 💫 Shout out to all the women trailblazers out there, esp. the Black and Brown women in the NFT space. I see you!! ❤️✊🏾 https://t.co/5mKLVn0nMT"
70,"@cclccl4461 Nice watch, I love it! I’m at dance class tonight wearing my Apple Watch and reppin #worldofwomennft https://t.co/5bAegkZgri"
71,"@Misk_one1 I’ve recently noticed every other new NFT is marketing itself with progressive identity politics. Not every project I purchase needs to remind me that I’m a woman/minority — while I do LOVE supporting mission focused projects  - I cherish the silly feel good ones too, like #mfers"
72,"@Misk_one1 I have an #mfer and see blue chip potential. The art is inspired by a viral comedic meme, “Are you winning, son?” Check it out. A fellow Collector friend who I trust calls MFERs “the NFT that captures the spirit of an entire generation.”"
