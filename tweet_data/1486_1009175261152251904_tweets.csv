44,"@wenmilk_eth But dude, your squishy pfp has a Frog Hat! So it’s not all bad, LFG!"
45,@coolcatsnft @nametagtweets Some people will probably read the word “goofy” and then interpret that this means that there will be a collab between @coolcatsnft and @Disney.

60,"@horndogdoteth @damp0z We’ll see, when I originally tweeted, Elu had just welcomed the new Cool Pets owners to their first Town Hall, and he mentioned an animated series, and seemed to imply it was in the works, but when later questioned on it during Q&amp;A the team wouldn’t “confirm or deny it”."
61,"@bazdoteth No further details have been provided so far, but I assume that information will be cleared up as we get closer to Tuesday’s $Milk launch."
62,"@TacticoolCat When pressed on whether there was an animated series for a second time just now, the team “could not confirm or deny” the animated series. Perhaps @evanluza inadvertently leaked the news earlier, we shall see. 🤔"
63,Breaking Cool Cats Town Hall Alpha: The $Milk liquidity pool that is being setup by the team will consist of “several thousand Eth” and the team has consulted with legal experts to ensure that it is “implication free”.
