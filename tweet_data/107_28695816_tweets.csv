1) Always try to hold at least a little liquidity. Opportunities and hedging both require this.

2) Diversify where possible.

69,"@MeDarkseid There's a failed or possibly blocked file-write activity from a particular application, that specifically only occurs on the new M1 silicon.

Unless it's something extremely obscure, it's not permissions related.

So I need some deep logging to understand what's happening."
70,"Okay folks, I need help finding a MacOS expert.

If you know anyone that is an absolute wizard with OS-level logging (particularly on the M1 silicon) can you send them my way?

I will happily pay for a 1hr consult to help track down a bug."

83,"Note two: If you revoke access, you’re setting the maximum amount a contract can transfer to zero. So it may still show in the Etherscan interface. https://t.co/iO91o8dypV hides these zero value approvals, I believe."
84,"@JammyCreamer @CxpperRaven Definitely not. Just be safe, use your hardware wallet appropriately and having approvals out there is fine."
85,"@AChuhunou I won’t speculate on that because I don’t have all the facts.

I strongly do not believe it to be the new OS contract though."
86,"@AChuhunou Assuming you clicked a URL, didn’t download anything, and didn’t sign a transaction: you’re fine."
87,"@AChuhunou It doesn’t solve the issue. It keeps you safe long enough to move your assets safely. (Via a different contract)

Revoking stops any transactions from being completed by that contract.
Granting those permissions again makes you vulnerable again if you signed a bad transaction."
88,@JxnetNFT @JeyRamm NO JXNET. ONLY MY EXPERIENCES MATTER. NOT YOURS! It’s about MEEEEEEEEEE.
89,"@CareyBradburn @Ghoudaaaa This is the official guide on how to do that with Ledger.
(Only do this once your assets are safely moved out to a different wallet in the meantime)

https://t.co/lTkR6JeK5U"
90,"@pravijn Yep. You’ll need to find a different contract to move your assets, if you’re concerned that you were phished."
91,"@ApeDegenNFT The reason is because this is a different type of signature. You’re signing an arbitrary message NOT a transaction.

The point is proving you own the wallet: that’s it.

The dangerous stuff will cost gas to run a real transaction."
92,"@ApeDegenNFT That’s getting into “reading the code” territory, but here’s what I recommend:

- Always double check the website you’re on before signing.
- Check that the contract address matches what you’re expecting to see. (Use official links to double check)
- Collab land is generally safe"
