20,@NFTsAnonymous @CommanderCrypt0 @TheeHustleHouse @not_katarina @topshotswickie @NFTPrince @DeezeFi @PRINTMYMINT @NFTherder @christinebarnum @CrazyCryptoCarl The doublespeak is what gets me. CAMP was supposed to avoid bagpumping and help new people in NFTs then shilled uncool cats and cool monkees nonstop. Now you’re telling everyone to think for themselves but your algorithm is going to tell them when projects are ok or not.
21,@NFTsAnonymous I saw it with CAMP and I see it here too. You love to tell everyone that influencers can’t be trusted EXCEPT YOU. That everything isn’t as it seems but TRUST YOU. I don’t know why you’re so hell bent on being arbiter for the NFT space but an algorithm assigning alignment ain’t it
22,@NFTsAnonymous But algorithms have bias put in place but it’s creators. Depending on the community it also has implicit bias. My point it you’re railing against people believing things yet assigning your own belief to your guidelines in this space. How do you mentally juggle that?
23,"@NFTsAnonymous Awful takes aside, if you think everyone should DTOR and consider all sides full tinfoil, how do you balance that with an NFT Accrediation program where you pick who is a good actor or not?"
