1,@JuliaLipton Haha I hope so.
2,@JuliaLipton I don’t see many people weirded out by it and it confuses me all the time.
3,Is anyone else alarmed by the fact that the age of politicians running our country get special hours at grocery stores and would be considered to be unhireable in the job market?
4,@JoeBiden Why do you refuse to acknowledge Tesla?
5,@AlexMasmej @Ukraine @shamakai
6,Who’s going to BTC Miami?
7,@itsizzylugo @KatColeATL @AthleticGreens I wanted to properly use it for the month to see and I definitely noticed a difference. Highly suggest.
8,@kwuchu Facts. Asked the dealership about the new NX and they basically laughed. I’m just going to need to pick up a Porsche 911 soon enough to make up for it 🤞🏼 haha.
9,@aol_xyz 👀
10,@kwuchu Super smooth ride and love the look. Tried for the 350 F Sport but even those are super hard to come by these days.
11,@kwuchu I picked up an IS300 yesterday bro. Not nearly as much of a beast as what you’ve got but I love it.
12,@mdudas 😂😂😂
13,@raihan_ Bro the hand pressed? What?!?
14,@amiyoshimura_ 👀👀
15,Big thank you to @KatColeATL for sending me some @AthleticGreens to try out. After using the month supply I have to say I’ve definitely noticed energy and digestion differences. Definitely planning on using it moving forward. https://t.co/f6BChf4LVT
16,"@agletdave @AgletApp We're due for a catch up, bro. Been a long time!"
17,Super happy to see @AgletApp doing big things. Remember joining the team pre-launch and how we needed to pivot everything because of covid shut downs. They've come a long way now having raised $24m to date with more on the way   https://t.co/8j4VRATZZn
18,@AlexMasmej @tryShowtime @dotsolo_
19,@CarlingJackson Yeahhhhhh. They aren’t even hiding it in those interviews. Just saying it straight up.
20,@CarlingJackson I’ve been thinking about it non stop that people talk about how war is happening now as if all the black + brown people who’ve been dying in wars these years weren’t humans.
21,"@yo Do you think they will at scale though? As of now, I’m not so sure. And imagine unless great intuitive tooling comes in we’ll face the same issues traditional governments have with these digital communities."
22,@drewcoffman @useGALLERY @FWBtweets This is a dope one!
23,Got into @HOWLERZNFT last week and think I need to ape into a second one. Awooo https://t.co/gUUDpTNCX2
24,@AdrianGrant @AndrewSteinwold does dope content and based on what you're building you two should definitely chat at some point in the near future.
25,Need someone to source how many student loan debts have been paid back because of NFTs. Seen so many tweets about people using crypto to erase that debt in particular.
26,Happy to be one of them 😃😃. Let's gooo!! https://t.co/LBqVfGNyCI
27,@JonathanColon__ That looks like paradise!
28,"And just like that I got approved to speak at @NFT_NYC!! 

Shoot your shots, people! https://t.co/DvgzMFq4YA"

32,Every story about Kobe starts with “he dropped 40 on me” 😂😂. https://t.co/8HGqeYX4hG
33,@xIN_8 @ManUtd This sick 🔥
34,@mdudas I always regret not buying luna at the moments I think I should.
35,@muneeb @ImranKhanPTI Yoo DM me when you get a minute. I’m chatting w the embassy here in DC. Might be cool to find a way to collab on this.
36,I think I need to get a tubby cat.
37,@wgm_v Yes. Yes. More yes.
38,It’s really interesting thinking about the future of financial warfare that’s begun now. Anything is fair game now. This will definitely have far reaching negative impacts everyone is ignoring right now.
39,How many NFT days pass in 24 hours?
40,It’s great that The Shop will be on YouTube exclusively soon. It’s amazing content that’s not being seen by enough people because it’s gated behind HBO. Shout out to Lebron and the team making that happen.
41,@jaesmail Definitely interested to!
42,@NFTland Even decent mobile games take years to build. Something like Valorant took 7 years to make. I don’t understand how anyone thought it’d be possible to build great games on new tech like blockchains in six months. Just those logistics felt like it’d be mostly scams.
43,@stephendpalley What about pineapple?
44,@MisterMcClenney @FWBtweets Welcome 🙏🏼
45,@NFTland My guess has been more people would like to rug and be the next pixelmon than they let on
46,@AB84 @boredpunksnft Down bad enough money wise already to need to do this?
47,@bradloncar Bitcoin is inevitable at this point and opinions like this only further cement it.
48,@osmedoc99 Oh and can’t forget about the epidemiologists.
49,It’s good to know that there’s so many foreign policy experts on here.
50,@alexlmiller Turo does the same. Get me every time
51,@RepClayHiggins I need some of what this guy is smoking.
52,"@robpetrozzo @OnRallyRd Bro, I would be so down and loveee that haha."
53,@robpetrozzo @OnRallyRd 7 1/2 if it’s a fitted. Happy to pick it up this week haha.
54,@ForcesHidden @Gemini @GeminiSupport Let’s make it happen! Hit me in the DMs. I’ll shoot you my number now too.
55,@ForcesHidden @Gemini @GeminiSupport Let’s definitely connect one of these days. Can’t hurt to reach out. She seems pretty reasonable from what I’ve seen so far.
56,@ForcesHidden @Gemini @GeminiSupport I’ve heard how bad it is so I never even really use them. Not that Coinbase is amazing. NY doesn’t allow USDT. Had someone send me a bunch of it. Account balance shows it’s there but it’s not in my portfolio. Not sure how to get it out because I get copy/paste responses from CB.
57,Need more OTC options for selling crypto here in the US.
58,@seyitaylor Depends on what the floor is. Also at activity in terms of eth movement in past 30 days. BAYC might have a massive floor but liquidity on them is way different than something at 1eth. Few things I’ve started to look at for metrics too in buying/selling as well that help.
59,"@ccarella Yeah, we’ll see how it plays out. I’m not saying I’m certain yet but things like having issues getting people to vote was something I saw coming. Delegates just seems to replicate moving towards existing structures of democracy. But I need to deep dive more too."
60,The more I think about student loans the more it seems like making sure to pay as little as possible forever is the best move because eventually they’ll forgive them. There’s no way people pay these back so it’s only a matter of time before it all implodes.
61,"@ccarella Yeah, that’s why I wouldn’t say I don’t see it, I just don’t see it yet. Also have a hunch that DAOs will realize they actually can’t fix a lot of the very human elements of what they believe tech can solve. It’ll just be old things with a new bow."
62,Is everyone still convinced 2022 is the year of DAOs the way 2021 was for NFTs? I’m not personally convinced. Seems a bit too early still.
63,Something something NFT music. Engagement galore.
