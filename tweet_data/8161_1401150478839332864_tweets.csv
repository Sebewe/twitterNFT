4,I will continue the rest of the story on another day 🍺
5,I decided to experiment with art. I think it was in the middle of the night when I created a half human half machine entity. I was on anti anxiety meds at the time.This piece represented the feeling of nothing. Emptiness.This would later become CYBORG #1 https://t.co/rzL6BOI8I4👇 https://t.co/YCDFRHd3Ul
6,I was sitting on the sofa one day and discovered GAN art. I’m an IT guy so the idea of creating art via Ai was intriguing. Some days went by and as usual started feeling depressed and anxious again. It was then when @Bitcojner told me “you need to express your emotions somehow”👇 https://t.co/3aIfofh8PS
7,"Art is valued in this space. The collectible aspect was intriguing too. (@Pokemon cards anyone?) How could I afford buying one? With mortage, kids, expenses-it seemed impossible. I even mentioned that during my interview with @allysonnewell @ColorCrypto https://t.co/zbm50QXDtK 👇"
8,"I’m an IT professional by day. As you might know I suffer from anxiety, depression and panic attacks. I was going through a rough patch at the time. I always found art soothing when I was a kid so #NFTs was extremely exciting to me. @Bitcojner had mentioned to me @Etherlambos. 👇 https://t.co/GREPMJgJoh"
9,"No bs advice of @kevinolearytv. Just 6 months ago I could barley afford paying a single txn on ETH, let alone own an NFT. I remember talking with @Bitcojner who told me one thing that changed my life: You’ve got to act at some point. How I turned my negativity into NFTs. 👇 https://t.co/WgHLwQeT13"

15,I will go ahead and say it. Putin must resign. If not he must be removed with force by any means necessary. Take it as you will.
16,"@TheAlienBoyNFT Yeah, I get it. I have my own collections I keep on producing art and won’t look back. I want to get known as an artist. To me it’s more important than the quick buck i could do by a rug. You have a long term vision that’s why I bought! Keep on crushing! 🔥"
17,"@TheAlienBoyNFT no point in rugging. You can make a hell of a lot of money just by being you plus it’s a great project, if I say so."

73,@PuffYatty Clone X. As an RTFKT creator I am biased tho.

And

2. Historical #NFTs"
