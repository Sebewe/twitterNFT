7,@Jdotcolombo @nftworldsNFT Major W. Congrats!
8,@TikTokInvestors Yet nobody actively involved in NFTs knows who the hell this dude is.
9,@Jdotcolombo @OGDfarmer Me too. This market is so stupid.
10,@Jdotcolombo @OGDfarmer Please tell me you didn’t buy that mfer Kevin bro?!?
11,@OGDfarmer Terrible. This is not the way.

13,@KingBlackBored @GOON8686 Like a game of hot potato! Someone will be left holding that bag. Just don’t let it be you.
14,@fvckrender You will regret it. If you really have that much an urge wait for it come crashing back down because we all know it will.
15,"@DegenSoul @ABigThingBadly @CliveApestein @0xApes_NFT The denial statement was in reference to the unoriginal, rip off, stolen BAYC art that 0xApes love to embrace all while bashing the BAYC community. I’m glad you are happier in the 0xApe community, just know BAYC is the rising tide that lifts all boats next time you hate on us."
16,@Sulolagwen Happy Birthday Lola! Hope you have the best day! 🥳
17,@moststonedape @BoredApeYC 🦧 🍌 🪙
18,"@DegenSoul @ABigThingBadly @CliveApestein @0xApes_NFT Generalizing half of the BAYC community once again, it’s just wild to say over 3,000 plus BAYC members are pricks. 0x is nothing to fear at all, it’s just unoriginal, stolen art unfortunately. If you don’t like that statement, then you are just in denial."
19,"@liloldhead @AB84 @boredpunksnft They did it to themselves with that terrible marketing. Siphoning money from the NFT community is pretty damn easy for most rug pull projects, but they set off some instant red flags with that horrible marketing strategy."
20,"@liloldhead @AB84 @boredpunksnft The fact that the team is talking about floor pricing prior to the drop, this is the most obvious cash grab! As if @ab84 didn’t already tell us that the other day!"
21,"@Cosmo_886 @yugalabs @BoredApeYC If you watched the full @VStrangeYUGA interview, then you could just tell there is something very exciting they are building behind the scenes. I think you are very much on the right track with this guess."
22,"RT @Cosmo_886: I don't know what the VX in BAYC VX Apes stands for in Roadmap 2.0.

23,"@Degentraland @doodles @BoredApeYC Please tell us why you believe this. I know they just got space doodles, but please tell me the Doodles catalysts that make you think that type of run is in their future."
24,"@DegenSoul @ABigThingBadly @CliveApestein @0xApes_NFT Just remember this, the very reason 0xApes even exist is because of the success of BAYC. So successful your project decided to steal all of their original art and ape traits and make yellow back grounds. But keep disrespecting the BAYC apes which made apes cool to begin with."
25,@DegenSoul @ABigThingBadly @CliveApestein @0xApes_NFT I have been in BAYC since day 1. I take issue with you attacking the very community in which the project you support stole art and created a knock off version. It’s not cool to generalize half of the BAYC community in your posts.
26,@Loopifyyy @DiscoverXnft Very accurate.
27,@OGDfarmer We know it won’t end well for many when the short attention spans in the space move on to the next hype train. This is just another game of hot potato. We have seen it before.

29,"@myburne79688938 @verified @TheSmarmyBum @Twitter Yes, one verified account today scammed a MAYC off someone today. It’s really a shame, hopefully they get that account taken down before they get anyone else."
30,@Nate_Rivers @verified https://t.co/EYygdluI1u
31,Makes sense why there is a surge of shady accounts with a blue verified check mark. @verified this is allowing scammers to portray themselves with credibility. Please deactivate these types of accounts. https://t.co/67CJeczTSm
32,"@wafudraws @0xslatt @cozywyatt @BoredApeYC @ProDutaFC I reported ‘it’s suspicious or spam’ then ‘it’s sharing links potentially harmful, malicious, or phishing sites’"
33,"@wafudraws @0xslatt @cozywyatt @BoredApeYC @ProDutaFC It's listed in the Slatt's tweet right above mine, pretty sure he blocked me because I have been trying to spread the word about his scams."
34,This scammer got a mutant from a fellow Club Member earlier today. I'd recommend all apes report this account and block it as well. Would hate to see anyone else get scammed by this individual. https://t.co/zo6SzeMec5
35,@0xslatt @wafudraws @cozywyatt @BoredApeYC @ProDutaFC I have reported their account. I suggest all apes do the same to try and prevent this scammer doing this to anyone else.
36,Be proud when you see how far you have come from where you first started.
37,@DiscoverXnft Congrats bro! Well deserved! You have been grinding for real. 📈
38,RT @sartoshi_nft: it's obvious we are all kinda burnt out and need a break from nfts so let's just do it everything will be ok it's not lik…

41,"@cryptobrickz @Ape2047 @0xMAYC_NFT Well, that mutant ape I just posted is from the legit MAYC collection. The fake mutants are just too close in my opinion."
42,@cryptobrickz @Ape2047 @0xMAYC_NFT It literally matches my mutant’s background from original MAYC collection. It’s not different. https://t.co/FW8O00kmiB
43,@Ape2047 @0xMAYC_NFT This is the background for my legit mutant ape. It’s definitely not going to workout well for @0xMAYC_NFT. https://t.co/iZRrdfBVhX
44,@CryptoStorm__ Checking in for that Cali roll call!
45,"@BAYC967 @yugalabs @BoredApeYC I definitely got those vibes when I watched the recent interview of Yuga Labs Co-CEO Nicole. You can just tell they have something exciting brewing, but she couldn’t shed the details."

47,@Loopifyyy Thanks for your perspective. Enjoyed the thread and I agree with many of your points.
48,@danielgothits Nice hat fam!
49,@TeddyBitcoins @metallionaire @Jdotcolombo @opensea Stealing original art should be embraced in Web3? These 0x projects are straight up cash grabs from lazy ass devs that want to siphon money out of the NFT space. They are not here to build and contribute the NFT/Web3 communities.
50,When an individual on NFT Twitter says drop your NFTs below because I am buying…they are actually…
51,"@SnipesNFT I’ve never liked discord much, but unfortunately I think it still serves a purpose for projects to disseminate information to their respective communities. I need to really cut down the amount of servers I am in presently, it feels like pure chaos!"
52,@misterdushan @BoredApeYC Happy Birthday fam! Hope it’s a great one!
53,@jmt_nft @PagneAndCaviar @weareround21 @mcuban I believe the initial Round 21 NFT provided access to purchase 2 BAYC basketballs.
54,@TjKongz @cipcity @ApeDao_ @BoredApeYC Welcome back to the club fam!
55,"@Jdotcolombo @opensea The mutants actually have yellow background in the original collection so this is an issue. I mean I hate the fact that these 0x collections steal and rip off art to begin with, but apparently @opensea thinks these collections are somehow okay. https://t.co/zk0rBizFi8"
56,"@HollanderAdam @AB84 @boredpunksnft This demonstrates how out of touch with the NFT space the team @boredpunksnft is by hiring @AB84 who is not actively involved in NFTs. The initial tweet by AB included 'Twitter Caption:' before the message and the video he said they had '100 discords, I mean 100,000 discords'.😂"
57,@jmt_nft @weareround21 @mcuban You just gave @weareround21 a nice talking point if @mcuban is on the panel!
58,RT @HODLING_TIGHT: I think #bitcoin is playing a bigger role in current global events than most realize.
59,@mhiggins Drift's story is amazing and his art is unreal.
60,@weareround21 Let’s go! I predict @mcuban will want to make y’all a deal.
61,@XaosBear @BoredApeYC Welcome to the Club! Great to have you!
62,@CryptoGarga @ProDutaFC Reported! ✅
63,@shockermandan @LooksRareNFT I am very surprised @Kyloren_NFT doesn't want the mutant as well. Looking forward to seeing some new BAYC auctions.
64,@shockermandan @LooksRareNFT You just bought this fine mutant! There must be something coming up for auction that you have your 👀 on!

69,@DahbiZak @Kyloren_NFT @BoredApeYC The market says otherwise.
70,"@xBenJamminx Imagine thinking this is how to spend your marketing budget. Even worse, anyone who mints is betting on the team that made this brilliant decision."
71,"@NBATopShotEast @AB84 @boredpunksnft Bruh but there is a ‘100 discords, I mean 100,00 discords’ 😆"
72,@0xHustler @AB84 What do you mean they got ‘100 discords’ 🤣 Whoever that was a wise way to spend marketing funds is a straight up fool.
73,@hotlneblng_ @NathanHeadPhoto “100 discords” 😆
74,@hotlneblng_ Twitter Caption: Cash Grab!

81,"@CuttyQ10 @0xHustler Don’t be mad at me. I hate to see the Mories holders be the ones that ultimately get hurt by this. If that simple tweet triggered you then that’s on you fam. It’s more so for the complete copycat, unoriginal projects that stole art like @0xApes_NFT. I wish you well!"
82,"@joelcomm @opensea The email isn’t from the official @opensea email! I simply don’t want unsuspecting people to get scammed! That’s why I posted it, great question sir!"
83,@pinkpotionss @imisstheoldtk @pogpm @shahh @BoredApeYC I can build a brand about the intellectual property I own around my apes. You clearly need to educate yourself on NFTs before speaking on what I own. I hope you choose to learn more because there are really great opportunities in the NFT space.

93,@ape7458 He is one of my favs for sure! Picked that bad boy up for 4 ETH back in the day!
94,@hunterorrell @NFTsAnonymous The low standards of the NFT space has created a rush to create projects by founders who were strictly in it for the easy money and not here to truly build. The NFT space has to be able to identify the right projects in which they choose to invest their precious ETH.
95,@hunterorrell I believe @NFTsAnonymous has something in the works in regards to this. Something has to change. I will not mint projects with anonymous teams. I will be betting on proven teams instead of empty promises and copycat roadmaps. Too many cash grabs.
