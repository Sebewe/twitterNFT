Go slow.
Keep this heuristic in mind.
Ask yourself, ""How has my risk increased?"""
8,"🏛️ Decentralizing a DAO or Protocol? 

🦹 Risks: Does the DAO control a large treasury or other resources? How easy would a governance attack be given governing power liquidity?
🦸 Defense: Decentralize slowly as you ensure proper controls are in place!"
9,"👑 Becoming popular in web3? Leading a DAO or project?

🦹 Risks: Your inherent risk is increasing! Be ready for phishing attacks!
🦸 Defense: Harden your accounts w/ MFA. Avoid clicking on links. Let collaborators know how to make sure they are talking to you."
10,"🖥️ Need to connect a wallet to a site?

🦹 Risks: Which account are you using? What's in that account? How are you connecting?
🦸 Defense: Is the site well-known and audited? Can you use a clean account?"

🦹 Risks: Your risk is increasing! What wallet are you using? Where did you store your private key?
🦸 Defense: Buy a hardware wallet. Transfer assets if you stored your key insecurely."

15,@NadavAHollander Will OpenSea add token approvals displaying and revoking functionality?
16,"@DavionTheDK @Dreamtourich @vvooter @isotile @rj Yes, was answering the question but should have clarified. That’s why you revoke!"
17,"@Dreamtourich @DavionTheDK @vvooter @isotile @rj By definition, you cannot remove signatures. A signature is just signing a message with your private key, which is easily provable to have been signed by you. Once it’s out there, it’s impossible to take it back."
18,I joke - get rid of that stuff.
19,I am really against accredited investor gatekeeping. And then I remember all the people in the @feiprotocol discord ahead of launch preaching to pre-swap 100% to TRIBE 🥴
20,@dfinzer @dfinzer But the thing that is a bit disingenuous here is that the entire attack vector is opened bc users sign away token approvals to OS like it’s nothing. @opensea has a responsibility to better show approvals and the revoke process. @econoar @iamDCinvestor @DCLBlogger
21,"Token approvals are crazy. They just are. In a low gas environment, the flow is different. It shouldn’t be “normal” to grant unlimited transfer approvals. We’ve got to come up with better ways to manage this."
22,"@vvooter @isotile @rj It’s the combination of you granting someone access to transfer tokens (what you do first when you create an OS listing - costs gas) and this sale signature.

The hacker takes the phished signature to OS and says look - he sold this to me. OS executes the trade on your “behalf”"

49,"👆 This strategy is great for communities/protocols using NFTs as initial ""access tokens,"" which we will continue to see 🔑.

It is not as great when you do not want equal voting power across holders but want those with more skin-in-the-game holding more voting power 🐒."
50,"👆 Luckily, the `erc20-with-balance` strategy still resolves for ERC-721 tokens.

How it works 🧑‍🏫

The strategy checks if your address has a balance `greater than` a minimum balance. If so, you get 1 voting power 💪🏻.

By leaving the minimum balance as 0, any holder gets 1 VP! https://t.co/yTaU9OZyuY"
51,"At @developer_dao, we have used a snapshot strategy that gives equal voting power across NFT holders 🙌🏻. Here's the rundown for other communities wanting to do the same!

59,"Personally, I believe the exciting thing is that the values &amp; principles set out by the innovators of crypto and decentralization will win out.

The principles around the blockchain trilemma, decentralization, and user ownership will win out.

But this is not guaranteed."
60,"This is healthy conflict as we all weigh the importance of decentralization and usability.

What innovators must realize is that the values have to win for adoption. Values are not always adopted for value-sake."
61,"Many of the debates seem to be natural conflict that arises as we progress up the s-curve.

It’s important for the innovators to voice the values that got us here. It’s important for the new adopters to build usable solutions."
