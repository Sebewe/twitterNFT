63,@ape7458 Spending the weekend in the mountains with a bunch of friends. Gonna be fun 🤝
64,@harrislipton93 Yeah… just goes to show Discord sucks but teams also need to be more conscious of how often they ping @ everyone. I’m still a holder but definitely not a community member anymore and honestly I’d sell if it wasn’t for such a loss 🤷🏻‍♂️

74,@dagg3rhigh @AbominablesNft @TribesNFT To keep them engaged and work their brains. It’s been fun and the community seems to be happy with what we’ve done so far. I think the weekly releases/discussions provide a more intimate connection between the community and us founders
75,@dagg3rhigh @AbominablesNft @TribesNFT Right now we don’t have much utility with it. We have community involvement helping us write some minor aspects and have roles set up for those that are more actively involved. Since we’re small we haven’t been able to provide much but we have added puzzles/codes in the story
76,@dagg3rhigh I’m writing the @AbominablesNft story every week via Captain’s Logs and think it’s really good. Can only be found in our discord at the moment though
