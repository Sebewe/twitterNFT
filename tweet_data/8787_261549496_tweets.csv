39,"Had to grab a couple @0xApes_NFT - I usually avoid derivatives and copy pasta, but they differentiated the way Expansion Punks did, re-ran the traits so there's no duplicates to the originals. So I appreciate that. It also reminded me of shopping for my original Ape. https://t.co/JyuESQxsm8"

42,I seriously just showed my girl the Ape floor right under 79 but thin. 5 min later it's at 82. #BAYC https://t.co/rSSFphiXXP
43,"@CapetainTrippy @LooksRareNFT @opensea False, but I hope not too long. I need to be able to browse. Glad they fixed the listing time issue though."
44,@Thenascarguru Take mine for 95 and I'll snag it.
45,@SeraStargirl Could've been worse.
46,"@SeraStargirl Happened to my first Ape, was a cross earring and things started to surge so rare prices were off. Was like a week or so later it sold. I still got back in with like 6eth profit but could have been way better. On my laptop I eventually saw a failure on the delist.. not on mobile."
47,"@0x_fxnction It allowed me to quit the job that was killing my soul. (Without selling but traded down) Took almost 5 months to find a new job, mostly for the gfs sanity. Hoping to find a way to quit fully in 2022. Harder with one Ape though."
