9,"@TappySF Literally $GALA Townstar is this lol, no clue why the masses aren't talking about it.  With that being said, the tokenomics need an adjustment but hoping GALA can figure that out in the long run 🤞"
10,"@Loopifyyy Most mature ppl in any business share their biggest losses for clarity and accountability.

65,"@KingzNft @lovennft This 100%, ain't it.  Literally just showing an outfit for 1 night 😂.  Cmon, at least do some research into her before judging a book ""by the cover"".

83,@foodgod @garyvee @steveaoki @creatureNFT LFG on the addition 🍅📈
84,"@no_piu_cap @NormanBreadFish @the_x2y2 Team no sleep like ""Any time is good"" 😂"
85,Wonder what % of people are spamming refresh on the @the_x2y2 airdrop page today 😂?
86,@NFTCrypMatt @hightopdoteth @Nate_Rivers @farokh @BT We're going to agree to disagree it looks like.  All I'm saying is don't be surprised when L2E takes a big portion of the current marketand these are worth a pretty penny.  Looks like you're a big Nate fan so probably biased as I'm a big BT fan and biased.  Onward 🤝.
87,"@NFTCrypMatt @hightopdoteth @Nate_Rivers @farokh @BT You're SO SHALLOW and yet again another person who cant comprehend the future utility of these pieces.  Unless you're part of the GALA ecosystem, I'd recommend doing more research into mint prices.  They lowered the DA to ZERO so of course Nate would buy at that point lmao."
88,"@NFTCrypMatt @hightopdoteth @Nate_Rivers @farokh @BT Opinions based upon ""I've never heard of this guy before yesterday"" give me a break lmfao.  Dude had no room to talk from the very start"
89,@NFTCrypMatt @hightopdoteth @Nate_Rivers @farokh @BT You guys are spinning this into your own narrative.  I never once said it was all controlled by Nate.  I called him out specifically caused he was trashing/laughing at BT in a recorded Spaces.  The least Nate can due is issue BT an apology cause in the end he's flipping his work.
90,@notwarrenETH @Twitter @verified @burnttoast @poopie @evankeast Verification devs def dropping the ball here 😓
91,"@koinroses Goals would be to bridge NFTs/crypto and make this is a reality in soo many countries out there.  If we can find a passionate, doxxed, cat loving team.  I think there's real potential here 🤍🐈‍⬛🐈."
92,@goos_eth @day25 @crypto888crypto @BT @GoGalaGames I can certainly understand that.  But with that being said. I'd highly recommend analyzing L2E's potential in general and have expectations for the value here. It feels shallow that everyone is worried about the price without considering future utilities.
93,@garyvee *devs are building 😏*
94,"@koinroses Me too, worldwide ✊.  I'd love to drop everything im doing and commit 100% of my time towards this 🥺"
95,@goos_eth @day25 @crypto888crypto @BT @GoGalaGames More than 11E someday. Who says that isn't a possibility?  Shows the immense lack of forward thinking which this market is headed to L2E utility.  Better buckle up cause I think you'll be very surprised.
96,"@goos_eth @day25 @crypto888crypto @BT @GoGalaGames For cheap, then turn around to flip it.  So again, you guys really have 0 room to talk about BT's 3rd NFT project if you don't even know who he is.  You cant gatekeep and say it's ""not"" worth it when you have zero clue about the utility it'll offer.  These could easily be worth"
97,"@goos_eth @day25 @crypto888crypto @BT @GoGalaGames Nobody bought an orb for that high, not even sure what the highest was but this drop was supposed to create value for 888 IC holders who could burn 3x for an orb.  They listened to the community, dropped the DA floor to ZERO. And allowed guys like Steve and Nate to pick up orbs"
98,@NFTArtCritic @888InnerCircle @lurvli1 @thelittlesnft It's also upsetting that lurvli threw misinformation in the red 🚩 portion stating that @NFT was a Realm partner when in reality 888 quickly ended it after listening to the community.  He stepped up and axed the relationship before minting happened but lurvli didn't state that.
99,"@web3love @NFTArtCritic @888InnerCircle @lurvli1 @thelittlesnft @crypto888crypto ""Rigged"" raffles?  That's a reach, can you prove that?"
