Now i want more...but buying a coin immediately after going up 50% in a day is against my rules. bah."

2,"Wow! My @SeekOneNFT that I minted just revealed.

I've lived in London, UK all my life so getting one with Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament on it is pretty sweet 👀 https://t.co/YGNqee2aHm"
3,"@kibanaut no, they won't. That's my whole point"
4,@kibanaut what about the people who don't see these announcements and just happen to dca a bit of kiba or sell some at the wrong time....suddenly they've got nothing?
5,RT @markgillespie: 👋🏻 @CBCreepz 🦎
6,@owli1984 @JungleFreaksNFT @LazyLionsNFT A freak I’ve yet to follow. Congrats on the 1k 🥳
7,@juanitocpt @SeekOneNFT yay! can't wait for reveal :)
8,@tresorprivedxb @CBCreepz 👋
9,"@Babar_NFTs @JungleFreaksNFT Yes BaBar, sweep up those dungarees 😆"
10,@NFT_Tristan @JungleFreaksNFT @THEPRINCE______ Nice Freak. I helped my uncle buy a couple of Freaks a couple of months ago and both of the ones he went for are also blue zombies 👀 Welcome aboard!
11,@buni966 I’m seriously thinking about semi liquidating one of my highly underperforming cryptos to get another node….

Want one? Buy a Jungle Freak and stake it. 😎 https://t.co/FUWaYz7sUY"
17,"@poya936 @direcrystal @creepztopia @JungleFreaksNFT She's got a damn fine collection of Freaks, no denying 👀"
18,@creepztopia @JungleFreaksNFT Reporting for duty! https://t.co/d4f4Abyo0W
19,@stirwood88 @creepztopia @JungleFreaksNFT Nice! I was looking at that one a little earlier and thinking how awesome the gen 2 of it will look
20,@Ultron8181 @JungleFreaksNFT awesome. Is that official merch? I love the idea of those cards!
21,@mortycryptox holy macaroni. That's a lot of MCC right there.
22,@TristinPiazza wish i could have got the funds together to get one yesterday. It would have required too much crypto tinkering...i've done way too much of that recently as it is!
23,@kyuss_eth depends how close it is to @SnoopDogg 's
24,"@creepztopia If we can get loomi back up a bit more (and i'm not being greedy here, but a couple cents at least?) then the passive income element is suddenly going to start appealing to the non game playing people again and @CBCreepz is going to start flying (it already is on yesterday). Nice"
25,@sonicfd7 @CBCreepz i dare say loomi being up 100% is contributing! good call @creepztopia 🚀
26,"@WonderTheBeast I think as more gen2 images come out and we get closer and closer to release, JF’s floor will definitely be going up."
27,"@WonderTheBeast I’m thinking slightly higher. But because we’re expecting higher, it’ll probably be lower, right? 🤪"
28,@the___ivan Seems like you might be onto something 🤣 I’ve given up trying to second guess this market
29,@Yousefchart @JungleFreaksNFT I heard the same 😎

41,@Babar_NFTs @MRogersDXB @TheRabb1e @TheLeaningLeft @JungleFreaksNFT So we lose our Gen 1’s?
42,RT @FonzGm: Imagine leaving your country to escape war and be able to carry life-saving funds by means of memorizing 12 words.
43,"@PrOxDuDe yeah, it's very difficult to imagine the massive pump will come in the next few weeks or even months. Just look upon it as a good opportunity to dca in a bit on projects you like i suppose. I feel they'll be a lot of bull traps between now and summer though.."
44,"@PrOxDuDe yup, it was supposed to be a lock, wasn't it?? Guess we'll just have to be patient"
45,"@IglooMediaBase @SeekOneNFT Yeah, I’m feeling pretty lucky to have a WL for this. Genuinely excited to see what I, and others, end up with 🥳"

Don't get me wrong, i'm pumped for the motor club (or clvb, no idea what the v thing is about but i'll roll with it😀) but Jungle Freaks Gen 2 is, i'm certain already, going to be my favourite NFT to date by a long long way.

Any way, hyped for tomorrow. 👀"
91,@carlosgil83 @CBCreepz Be careful for the unscrupulous right click -&gt; download brigade who are jumping on these bandwagons despite never having bought an nft in their lives. I'm trying to quickly vet all the people i follow now as simply trusting the PFP (unless it's a hex) can lead to fake follows :(

Looking at my collection, and volume/hype/art etc, i think @cosmodinos could well 10x before summer. It's sitting at .13 now and 1.3 is a solid goal i'd say!"
