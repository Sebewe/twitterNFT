40,@charliemktplace @Hemilolz @opensea @etherscan What browser you using? Etherscan works best with firefox.
41,@opensea cut the bullshit and let us know that it wasn't just a phishing attack. Your integer you have named as salt has a loop hole allowing people to force values into memory.
42,@Hemilolz @charliemktplace @opensea @etherscan My etherscan is working and can see what they are seeing.
43,NFTOpSec needs to be a thing ASAP
44,"This was a double edged sword. Just bc you are safe one way, you might now be safe the other way. How to help yourself: 

Metamask: disconnect sites from your wallet. 
Etherscan: https://t.co/EwcK8SYEQ9
connect wallet and disconnect from ERC-20, 721, 1155 sections."

51,"@BULLMOVEMENT888 When reading data from the scammed tx, I think it was a phish attack targeted via email. Users that received the email, clicked the link in their email, and then essentially linked their wallet and the hacker had access to them."
