31,idk what that work is. maybe it's web3 companies protecting employees and pushing back against abusers. maybe it's safer spaces for those being harmed. maybe it's just giving a big middle finger to your favorite anon defi accounts who encourage the disgusting behavior.
32,"just a reminder to everyone that on-chain harassment is real

AND

the harassment off-chain on crypto twitter and other forms of social tech is truly abhorrent.

we have a lot of work to do. https://t.co/iMI1tU8jsZ"

55,fun fact: I’ll almost always join work calls with my video on and if I turn my video off it’s because i have to step away for a second or I’m crying
56,who does nnnnicholas listen to as he falls asleep every night?
57,the good thing about being new to this space is that idgaf about your favorite problematic defi anon accounts. literally no idea who they are and why they important. but fuck u for continuing to support them as they encourage harm through their followers.
58,But if you are acting in the best interest of abusers and bullies instead of the people being punched - you are the problem.
59,Heck I need to do better. I need to speak up more sometimes. I need to shut up more other times.
60,if you are a member of a company or dao or wallet and think this miiiight be about you… that maybe you haven’t been protecting those who are are actively experiencing harm. Then yeah this is about you. And you need to do better.
61,Maybe I’m just too close to it seeing someone I care about being harassed on chain and in mentions. Or that it’s just too recent that marginalized communities are being hurt by really harmful tweets.
62,Idk why I expect web3 companies/DAOs/wallets to be focused on making this space one focused on care but suddenly very overwhelmed and saddened that it isn’t the case.

88,@taylorsschumann Yesss we love to see it 👏🏼
89,Any further tweets at this moment would be ramblings around that same thought. So imma go eat dinner now.
90,"All this to say, his words - whether from him or from someone else’s pastor, parent, friend - have caused damage."
91,"And that’s where my concern is. If people don’t start realizing that their words matter in the web3 world, web3 will become a place marginalized communities don’t feel safe. And if we want web3 to be reflective of the world around us - that’s something we should consider."
92,"Do I think Brantly “hates” gay people? No. Not in the common sense of it. 

But do I think his rhetoric has been part of the hatred shown toward the queer community? Yes. This rhetoric has led to children being kicked out of homes…to higher suicide rates."
93,"Anyway. I think “hate” is often thought of as things you do TO (and possibly a about) someone. 

But it can be so much more than that when you break down how your power or voice or involvement in certain structures can truly impact the livelihood of those that you disagree with."
94,More thoughts a bit later but errands gotta happen so there’s a bit of a thread for you as a treat. Brb
95,It was only later in life - and probably around the time I became more affirming - that I realized that hate wasn’t about your actions as much as your view of other people’s identities and peoplehood.
96,"2) for the longest time, I thought of “hate” as something that is very /active/. ie I don’t HATE gay ppl bc I’m not calling them bad names or bullying them or telling them they can’t have an ens name."
97,"So I say all this as a background to share two things -

1) there are lots of Christians that fully affirm, love, and support the LGBTQ+ community. There are also lots of people who would say “those Christians” aren’t really Christians. Lol I’ve been in both sides 🤦🏼‍♀️"
98,I’d say I was on the affirming end of the spectrum starting in 2012ish- and became more convicted with that as time went on.
99,Grew up in the baptist church. Went to a baptist college. Then worked at several Christian universities. Always “struggled with my faith” - and things really started breaking down for me around 2017-2018.
