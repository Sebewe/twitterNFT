22,@Coinbase_NFT twitter finally is verifying pfp's?
23,@RDM_41 That’s all I ever do. Then just pay them off. If people use debit or transfer that to me is yikes.

28,@TheCryptogatsby It’s the one thing that hasn’t made me look at amc and gme. I’m always have tempted to cash out and buy more bears but I’m so close to a year holding.

34,"@OttoSuwenNFT A lot of us made money in wow in the early days. It was so frowned upon then with tos but it may finally happen. Just the games have to get to 2021 levels, not 1990."
35,"@Decentraphile I think it’s pretty funny all are saying take profits. It’s not even open sea doing this. No one saw this coming. Then they say they deserve it because the fees but again, it’s not open sea lol"
36,@NFTLlama @Llamaverse_ an electric announcement followed by a strong drink followed by moon?
37,@madragtrades @theMattyJP @bears_deluxe Isn’t that super rare? Has to be top 150
38,@dt_chain @BoredApeYC I love how diamond hands now are 7 months lol.
39,@maxzilla_eth @pandez_ I remember Digimental doing kind of the same for bayc and now the most hyped project ending the year. Not saying do it but…
40,@apebayc These are so old. It’s like bayc give-a-ways. Just stop.
41,@TheDeluxeJuice @bears_deluxe @NateDiaz209 Yeah hes been in awhile. Awesome to have him.
42,@MetaMooseNFT @ZssBecker  is the only reason I got into nfts. His humor is insanely funny.
43,@bears_deluxe @AtilanoNFT Done.
44,"@bears_deluxe @drmbrothers Popped up one night mentioning so bought. Used to be following all ufc and golf, now it's bears lol"
45,@hawkfinance1 @Dark0wls @bears_deluxe Awesome!
46,@OttoSuwenNFT Or you could have watched and got something.
47,"@lucasfg95 @bears_deluxe Crazy, did the same. Bought 3. It pumped, then went down. Sold a bear to buy a @Llamaverse_  pass. Needless to say, I'm down on that 13k lol"

53,RT @pixelmagenft: @opensea what do I have to do to get verification moved to our new collection?
54,@MonkeGameNFT https://t.co/ADZHtfTCzq
55,@MetaMooseNFT can never verify when it requires phone number. It's tied to an old account.
56,@TheSandboxGame 12k for a pass?
57,@Llamaverse_ @NFTLlama Yeah Matt isn't losing lol
58,@DickGameNFT uhh lol
59,@crispylines Follow for the nft talk. Stay for jeeps :)

70,@koingamesio Wow as well. Before that ac
71,"@akafacehots @Coinicarus @icosanaut @unusual_whales @0n1Force Again not true. But that’s why  it takes time with the majority. If you think that way, look back in a few years. And no offense but you’re not an artist or even familiar with the space thinking that way. Look it up. Get familiar with it. Learn blue chips and utility. Then go."
72,@akafacehots @Coinicarus @icosanaut @unusual_whales @0n1Force Not even close to be true.
73,@Coinicarus @icosanaut @unusual_whales @0n1Force Love people still calling nfts a scam. It’s like 2015 with crypto.
74,@SacksJacked @unusual_whales @0n1Force Uhh no.

82,@eddyiskongz @mixksss I just wish there was a better platform versus discord. It’s terrible and mainly all use it :/
83,@intocryptoverse Another 50/50 poll from you lol
84,@ShinySanti @LlamaPass I own a pass. Still don't get it. 2am drunk purchase.
85,@ape_g4ng I’m sure they will pick mainly blue chips and most popular ones
86,@kevwuzy What’s the portion lost come out to?
87,@JamesHODLs_ @ComingSooner_ Those are now 1.4 floor? Ok
88,@AltcoinDailyio Cardano wants to talk to you.
89,@beaniemaxi True but you stay for the art or the cuteness. Then you see hapebeast and are like whoa next level. People get attached.
90,@NathanHeadPhoto So many good ones. Doge good. Bears good. Mars cats good.
