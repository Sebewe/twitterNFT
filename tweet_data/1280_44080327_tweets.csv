6,@jstn What do you mean? I see Verizon Red and Fanduel Blue just fine.
7,"@turoczy @staplepigeon Nice. I was brainwashed by the big brands in the late 80s/early 90s. Always treated shoes like little cars for my feet so I wanted the fastest/flashy ones. I've evolved and wearing a Volvo on my feet is what I need. Sounds like they'll make for a great, reliable daily driver. 🙂"
8,Ordered my first pair of Pumas ever yesterday. These @staplepigeon Puma Suedes just went way too hard. Can't wait for them to get in. 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/Sh4F45dc30

10,"Wow. Just read a theory about how much meaning @RTFKTstudios has baked into their MNLTH release. The obsession with Ancient Egypt and artifacts, the use of the Metatron's Cube, and the ERC-1155 burning mechanism to introduce people to their Meta Dungeon game is a Masterclass."
11,@themikecasey @Krista_Kim I would describe my trip to Berlin in the same way. Cinematic streets and architecture. America is quite the opposite the majority of the time.

18,@RTFKTstudios And the rest of Nike’s metaverse where you’ll hang out with other Clones. You will no longer need Discord. Your pods will be get you essentially an apartment there as well. I could also see a sneaker airdrop incoming as well.

42,@meaganloyst @viamirror You are totally right and I need to work on my reading skills. Nikeland doesn’t involve Clones (yet?) but they’re a Top 5 project on OS and have already airdropped free metaverse real estate to all Clone holders. Looking forward to reading more of your work!
43,@meaganloyst @viamirror This is great! But curious to why there’s no mention of RTFKT or Nike or CloneX?

69,@heylookitsalan Time to set it up outside your front yard and recoup the investment w/ the neighborhood kids
70,@staringispolite I don’t know if it has anything to do with my status but I’ve gotten at least 6 pairs of 350s and 700s from an exclusive access notification. Those purchases have prolonged my Icon status 😂
71,@staringispolite For sure. Doubt they had any hand in the writing of the smart contract either. Even the language in the micro site didn’t sound like the adidas voice. I also wonder if the aesthetic of Originals resonates with existing holders for the WL.
