24,"@Timbulani @CalcioNFT @CoolmanUniverse @CryptoDadsNFT @VinnieHager @BYOPills @WonderPals You minted on ETH, is that environmentally responsible? 😂"
25,"@Timbulani @CalcioNFT @CoolmanUniverse @CryptoDadsNFT @VinnieHager @BYOPills @WonderPals Ah, congrats dude 🔥 you minted a rare one!"

46,@sobylife @WeatheReportNFT @tobylasso @tobylasso for president!!
47,Because I've spent the last week dead from #ETHDenverFlu... it only seems right that I get this as my @WeatheReportNFT reveal later. https://t.co/pE92lD7fCW
48,"@Spadams15 Haha, I'll start work on the costume"
49,@benja_brajovic GM to you brother 🙌
50,@DerfAbides Hey Derf 👋
51,GM you beautiful people. https://t.co/9BT8ewZ5kp
52,@TheArtman555 @RCSPod @CalcioNFT @tobylasso Thank you for your kind words. We appreciate you ♥️
53,@RCSPod @tobylasso @WeatheReportNFT GM
54,@reachn4thetop @WeatheReportNFT @CalcioNFT @tobylasso @RCSPod This man is multiple prestige on his sniper class
55,Looking 4wrd to the @WeatheReportNFT mint later today and finally being able to put my ETH in support of the team. Me and @CalcioNFT found the FUD storm really hard to stomach after having @tobylasso on the @RCSPod. You couldn't meet a more genuine guy. All the best 4 the mint ♥️
56,@cryptoshambles @RobbieKnox Quick get the ENS
57,.@RobbieKnox Kleenex Balsam... Now I get it. Thanks for the alpha. #DenverFlu
58,"@reachn4thetop @CalcioNFT Haha, im sorry bro the ETH Denver flu has almost killed me and cancelled our recording tonight. We might try to brave a recording of just me and @CalcioNFT  tomorrow but will wait and see if my cognitive function has returned. Also my voice is awful 😅 you wouldn't want to hear."
59,@FoxqueenQueen I've been wanting to share this one for a few days. Today is the first day since Eth Denver I've been coherent enough to write a thread 😂
60,"@cryptoshambles @reachn4thetop Definitely, V2 is a legend and a much loved member of any any community lucky enough to have him part of."
61,@ape1_lady 💯
62,"I will follow anyone who retweets this thread. 

Let's get the projects for good out in front. 

#ETHDenver #NFT #NFTs #NFTCommunity #CryptoDads https://t.co/Dcmt5Wz3eU"
63,@SRJR29 Both me and you know that you are one of the models
64,Spread the word.
65,"Please do take the time to check out their project, there are investment levels for all, so maybe put some of that ETH to good use rather than deleting it on another rug. With all that's going on atm let's push these good news projects to the front.

This is going to be BIG."
66,"The artwork is insane, website smooth AF and the whole team has put together something incredible. They already have some major partners like @Zeneca_33  and will soon be coming onto the @RCSPod to discuss it in depth."
67,"Their project mantra is to secure at-risk land in the Amazon rainforest to stop deforestation and protect its biodiversity. As a holder or ""guardian"" you are fostering sustainable activity that benefits the land and the people who live there."
68,"Everyone should be taking a look at their project! @nemus_earth  is the epitomy of a collectible NFT with real world utility for good, that goes way above a small % of mint going to a charity."
69,"We all hit it off instantly and ended up spending most of #ETHDenver hanging out. From Big Dad Energy at the CryptoDads IRL event, chatting DAOs at 3am in the castle (with some scotch) and VIP at Major Lazer in the Temple... we already have plans to hang out again."
70,"Being the nice guys that we are, me &amp; @CalcioNFT  decided to wait with @reachn4thetop in the 3 hour COVID test line despite having ours already and im glad that we did as we were fortunate enough to meet @Biaaancaaa  &amp; @muninn23  from @nemus_earth."
71,"It's a weird thing to say but a few of the main highlights for me from #ETHDenver came when standing in line or queueing (as us brits say). 

I have crawled out of my ETH Denver coma to drop this alpha so make sure to read it🧵👇👇 https://t.co/cBvM4UQ2uL"
72,@QueenRusskiy @Blockworks_ Don't sleep on awesome collabs forming from ETH Denver attendees

83,"Who else is suffering with the #ETHDenver flu? 

#ETHDenver2022"
84,"Hoping for a quick and peaceful resolution to the hostilities, my thoughts are with those affected 🙏🤟

The quicker the adoption of crypto and decentralisation the better. Social and Political reform is needed worldwide."
85,@winnynft Amen! 😂
86,Totally overwhelmed by how much I enjoyed #ETHDenver. The vibe was insane and totally affirmed my belief in the space and how it was the correct decision to quit my job and do this full time. Learnt so much and met some incredible people. More info once my brain recovers ..a bit.
87,@songadaymann That's insane bro. Big party planned for 5000?
88,@cryptomacza @CalcioNFT @CryptoDadsNFT What?!? You've already left @CalcioNFT ? 👀👀
