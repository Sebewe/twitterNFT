26,"@zaimirii Sadly no, it’s business hours 🥲"

41,Damn doodles discord was really hacked. Shit wild. Even the mighty get hit
42,"@GabeGarcia11 Me either but it’s believing with the rate that CC is growing. Hopefully it all gets sorted out if it is them cuz that’s not very Web3 of them.

I won’t be surprised if we see more DMCA if the future tho with major brands coming into the space"
43,@GabeGarcia11 Not yet. Rumors all point to CC especially with the old tweet surfacing from the mories page paying homage to CC but not confirmed.

49,The star catchers art is dope. I’m a fan
50,Opensea gave projects a redo removing old listings. The % of amount listed is drastic in many projects.

Something to give holders a way to interact outside of discord &amp; IRL events"

76,@TheShamdoo he also gets 5 free IF tho so he paid 260K for those 5 or 217K for all 6.
77,@TheScoopy1 Art is great but i feel like there’s so many walking/moving 3D art dropping weekly so them taking too long to drop just caused an influx and doesn’t make them so unique anymore 😞😢
