28,@inamoonmission @DizzyDragonsNFT love it
29,"@m0taverse @doodles @coolcatsnft @NFTeams_ is often overlooked - tournaments already in play with cash prizes.

love the @DizzyDragonsNFT for the art."
30,@GratefulApe_eth yea it's one thing to hold and another to be involved w/ community and advocate for a project. Find it hard to do the second for more than 1 or 2 projects to be honest lol
31,@xBenJamminx Great cause 3ETH would be that 20% prediction right now :D
32,@xBenJamminx thoughts?
33,[2/2] I'm bullish on floor price and personally think it could go MUCH higher than 20% of @coolcatsnft floor because of the tokenomics and gamification (quests etc) that's built into this new collection.
34,"[1/2] Very excited about Cool Pets launch today. A basic prediction based on @BoredApeYC + @GutterCatGang.

Mutants (+100% supply) floor sits at 20% of BAYC floor. Gutter Species (+300% supply) sits at 20% of GCG.

Prediction: Cool Pets settles at min 20% of @coolcatsnft floor."

64,@Guns1801 @Morphlo @DizzyDragonsNFT @Roblevypixels Was free mint for fused dragons though right? Good vibe in that place so you're welcome back any time :)
65,@Guns1801 @Morphlo @DizzyDragonsNFT either way I have much faith in @Roblevypixels and team. Definitely not a cash grab but obviously we can't predict the future sales or popularity. All i know is they are giving it 100%
66,@Guns1801 @Morphlo @DizzyDragonsNFT Just a matter of time bro - look at the attention to detail with the world building. Good example is the art and story on the website - a level of effort and detail seen on very very few projects.
67,@Guns1801 @Morphlo @DizzyDragonsNFT Yes but when Dizzys hit then the rare attributes become powerful ;)

87,"@ThatsTheGwei Needs to be a collab between the best game studios + best NFT projects - not seen this yet.

Too many projects naively think that because they know how to develop a game, that they'll create a successful game. Game studios spend millions on story, casting, design, dev, marketing."
