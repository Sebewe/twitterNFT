84,@b0nzi_ People have tried to buy yours and said it won’t go through
85,"@b0nzi_ They did and then we, as in me and my colleague, took it over and fought back with lawsuits and won."
86,"@itsArbitrage @PionkeThe No one said that, but when you advertise yourself as a “professional undercutter” you are asking for this kind of questioning"
87,@b0nzi_ That’s unfortunate that you think taking your issues out on struggling projects that have nothing to do with those threats would somehow solve your problem.
88,@b0nzi_ You didn’t answer my question
89,What kind of person does this and for what purpose? Honest question https://t.co/elKJGeRdyB
