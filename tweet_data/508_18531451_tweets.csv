26,@bombaymalayali 👍
27,@MJmehakjain that's one of the reasons I never ever went with option A.
28,@MJmehakjain makes sense. I should jumble up the topics. like... I can ask for what's in dinner tonight right? https://t.co/jrwkbmN2MF
29,@punk6333 @TokenAngels That's a nice rich punk.
30,"@MJmehakjain do you believe choosing option ""A"" will have a huge influence on artists' expectations from the collectors? (purely sales related)"
31,"@youtrusteth That makes sense, Thanks Panico 🤝"
32,@youtrusteth Do you think Abstract artworks need an explanation from the artists?
33,"@bombaymalayali ""People pay for the artists, not the art"". Do you think this is true Anand?"
34,@PrinceArora213 not a sarcasm prince🙂 you will know clearly when I do.
35,"@PrinceArora213 Interesting, that totally makes sense, Prince. thank you."
36,@PrinceArora213 (tbh im not biased) but isn't that a collector's job to understand that art? how can an artist impose something on them that they are not able to see first?
37,@KeyboardMonkey3 @rakesh_pulapa @rakesh_pulapa is goated. Congratulations both.
38,Thank you for all your responses.

44,@16elevenart What would you do if you just want to buy 1 artwork?
45,@khwampa Interaction. Via any mode artists have made available for their collectors.
46,@Milibooo I like your analogy.
47,@graphicurve You stole my playbook Disha. ❤️ 😅thanks.
48,@rakesh_pulapa 👊
49,"@SREERANJ That's me for every single purchase of mine. 🙂 
But clearly, collectors/artists have subjective choices which I want to evaluate."
50,@Yashika__Kalra How one can do both? What would you do if you want to buy an artwork? Just 1 artwork.
51,"@retina_vision Yes, you did and I like it. ✌️"
52,@NudeYogaGirl Interesting. Thanks.
53,"How one should collect 1/1 art? 

A: Connect with the artist first, Know more about them and their art.

B: Buy what you like first, And you may connect with the artists later for further details.

I would like to know what you think, post your reasonings if possible."

61,@lets_dubdub https://t.co/Y13DKU6Hc5
62,@16elevenart 😅 lol. And this time they should be ashamed of tweeting “my ape got stolen because I was too busy rumbling”
63,@bombaymalayali https://t.co/IeIec0l16D
64,@16elevenart People deserve to be scammed and rugged if they expect to have a “rumble in a jungle” by flaunting their net worth.
