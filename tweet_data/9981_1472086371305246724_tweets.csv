1,"Will the same opportunities exist in crypto 5 years from today? 

Crypto might become mainstream and hence not so profitable. Or crypto might die and become not profitable at all.

The world is split. The best you can do is take the profits available right now :)

5,"So if you want to insure yourself against any smart contract bug or against $UST depeg, you can try out https://t.co/3L367UDHbX"
6,"However, like any other DeFi project, there are risks involved. $UST could lose its peg, there could be a smart contract bug or people can just stop borrowing!"
7,This obviously only holds true if Anchor can sustainably give 19.6% returns throughout the year. And here's the best part! I have been following Anchor for almost 6 months and they are consistently able to give returns higher than 19% 🤯
8,"One year from today, the value of 1 $aUST will become 1.196 $UST. Which means you will be able to sell you 100 $aUST for 119.6 $UST."
9,Let's assume 1 $aUST = 1 $UST. This means that if you lend 100 $UST (worth $100 because $UST is pegged to the dollar) you will get 100 $aUST in return.
10,So how do you get your 19.6% returns ? Anchor Protocol. You can lend you $UST on Anchor and get $aUST in return.
11,"$UST is a stable coin in the Terra ecosystem. It's the 17th largest coin by market cap and it's the third largest stable coin (after $USDT and $USDC). For perspective, it's market cap is larger than $DAI"
12,"Here's your gateway to 19.6% returns on a stable coin

49,@cryptoginko @Route2FI @anchor_protocol https://t.co/KMWQQdELSt
50,@Route2FI The problem with most of these yields is that it's high in the beginning but very soon it begins to fall and then it's just better if you had your money in @anchor_protocol or if you use the degen strategy. Need an efficient tool to move my money automatically when it drops.
