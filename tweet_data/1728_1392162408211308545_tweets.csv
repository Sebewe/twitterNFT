85,@itstylersays What are you talking about? You didn’t lose everything in a boating accident
86,"@wtfismh @Linny_Joyner @chefwanda5 @mchooyah No clue, but it looks like this will do. Thanks!!"
87,@Linny_Joyner @wtfismh @chefwanda5 @mchooyah scary and sobering thought that isn't farfetched at all. I'm interested in reading the article and seeing the examples used. I'll search around for it.
88,"So proud to be apart of @worldofwomennft with the amazing work this team is doing for the community. This beautiful project is undervalued imo, but not for long. We're going places! Shout out to the community and the whole team👏 https://t.co/giA5f7kYHP"
89,@Linny_Joyner @wtfismh @chefwanda5 @mchooyah History does tend to repeat itself. Usually the great empires have fallen from within before the enemies walked through the gates
90,"@wtfismh @Linny_Joyner @chefwanda5 @mchooyah Yeh I agree with this statement as well. It's the left and the right that have an equal fault in creating this, people need to stop arguing about what separates us and instead build on the things we agree on. Not sure why so many have such contempt for their fellow citizens"
91,@tfnlimited1 @RealSupDucks ohhhh sup!
92,"@Linny_Joyner @chefwanda5 @wtfismh @mchooyah Yeh and that’s not right at all, there’s absolutely hypocrisy on their end and it’s disgusting too. Also freezing bank accounts is a slippery slope that neither left or right should be allowing"
93,"@chefwanda5 @Linny_Joyner @wtfismh @mchooyah That being said, freezing accounts of those protesting and who you don’t agree with is so wrong on so many levels. Crypto fixes this. Protect yourself because the gov sure won’t"
94,"@chefwanda5 @Linny_Joyner @wtfismh @mchooyah They are absolutely disturbing the peace of their fellow citizens. This isn’t a tit for tat, or pointing fingers saying “but look at them they did worse!” That’s childish af. It all needs to be called out and shunned."

98,@Zeneca_33 Juan Valdez in Miami airport
99,"@0x_FLEA @popobiz123 @ShrewdCharlie Agreed. People need to stop listening to people like farokh. They aren’t helping you, they’re pumping their bags"
