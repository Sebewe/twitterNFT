15,@cryptocevo @SalsaTekila Ohhhh just buy before the price goes up. That's where I've been going wrong all this time 🙄🙄
16,"@StrongHedge Well that's just rubbish. What about all the people who stacked coins like $matic, $sand even $btc and $eth from 2018 onwards. DCA is the best strategy for 90% of people"
17,@lexfridman Best podcast on the planet 👏
18,@WilhelmTell3675 @nicksdjohnson Yeah the flashbot stuff is a nightmare and I guess if there's no better solutions on the table then fair play. I'm just saying now the richest people in the space have the most power. Blockchain is ment to be inclusive. Doesn't seem fair either.
19,@nicksdjohnson I understand this is a very difficult problem to solve but I feel this proposal completely prices out your average person. Atleast at 2k I might have had a chance at getting a name I was desperate for.
20,@kerneltrader This is a poor take. The advice she gave is solid. How about backing her up instead of trying to bring her down

25,@aoxborrow @enstools @ensdomains This is class. Well played 👏👏
26,@ForSureNotHere @nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @serenae_fansubs @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains Imo the only thing the high premium does is price out the majority. Everyone should have equal opportunity to get the name they want. I think nick and the team are doing a great job. Decentralisation isn't easy.
27,@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @serenae_fansubs @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains Raffle the name. Winner pays the 2k.
28,@The_Vilest @BrantlyMillegan This is the only chart that has ever made sense to me.
29,@BrantlyMillegan Can't buy the dip if you are already all in 🤣
30,"@ksicrypto Lesson 1. Make your own decisions in crypto as no one knows the future. 

Lesson 2. Just DCA as 90% of traders lose."
31,@LINKexperiment $250 will be the new $25. I imagine it will ne like when $bnb took off and just didn't stop
32,"@BrantlyMillegan Ngl it seems like he's not interested in ens domains so in the words of the great satoshi
“If you don’t believe it or don’t get it, I don’t have the time to try to convince you, sorry.” Let's raise the money but not so pomp gets credit but to show how powerful ens community is."
33,@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @MAB @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Instead of raising the fee you should add an option to register interest in the name. Upon expiry on of the parties who have registered interest is selected at random (linkvrf) and is given the option to buy the name for the premium within 24hours. Fair for everyone

55,@KahnobsNFT @BrantlyMillegan @OfficialFoxGame @ensdomains @daviseford Yeah I like this too. Like if you see a name it's ens
56,@alexgausman I thought it would be great for subscription services like sodaclub.eth. I buy the subdomain me.sodaclub.eth and get instant access to all the content. Then to end I simply don't renew or even better could then sell my subscription by selling the nft

61,"@evan12286 @praboda @tyler I'm also no expert but I assume it's because aws is centralised. If they decided to turn of your service your ""web3"" app would not function. For true decentralised apps we need decentralised storage like arweave or filcoin or using eth and thegraph protocol"
62,"@0xmother @BrantlyMillegan @elliotkoss I think ens is thinking long term here. I have registered one for over 50 years. But once I'm dead and gone someone else will be able to use it. If I owned it outright and didn't sell it, it could be gone forever."

65,@CamusDefinitely @Achoo77712467 @dbzdoteth @BrantlyMillegan @MrBeast @ethleaderboard ENS has done a stellar job. If they had reserved names it would have been worse imo. Hopefully as a community we will find a way to resolve it.
66,@dbzdoteth @BrantlyMillegan @MrBeast @ethleaderboard Quite funny that there was outrage that someone gave an ens for free but when it comes to charging someone (who has changed many lives for the better) half a million dollars to use a name they have built a brand around not a peep 😂 maybes wngmi
