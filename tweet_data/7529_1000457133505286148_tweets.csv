35,@sayinshallah Stop raging on Twitter and stop criticising others for the sake of it. You don’t need other people’s validation..you don’t need to convince anybody that you’re right. Learn to not care
36,@ThinkingBitmex You need to chill and focus on yourself dude. Serious negativity vibes

70,@KeyboardMonkey3 Let us know what you decide.. preferably before it happens
71,@bensoncrypto Ethereum but Layer 2 is where the party will be. MATIC will be a big winner. I see more Layer 2 acquisitions being folded into MATIC (zkr’s) and the conversation will move past the Layer 1 narrative and onto commercial applications

77,$BTC looks like bullish divergence to me https://t.co/0Cq3K1Xm5t
78,@C1aranMurray Indeed.. they’ve managed to contain it quite well so far but contagion will become more of an issue in Q1 and the problem will more complicated IMO
79,"@C1aranMurray Housing activity accounts for ~29% of China GDP. China accounts for 15% of world GDP and has been the most important source of growth over the past ~20yrs. Thus, clear downside scenario is no growth plus inflation (i.e. stagflation). Meanwhile, central banks have their hands tied"

89,@BullRunnner77 Increasing institutional adoption means higher correlation with equity markets that are currently “risk off” due to Evergrande. I remain bullish but think we’re in for a choppy ride
90,@BullRunnner77 I sure wish bitcoin didn’t chose to have a meltdown in December though
91,@cryptorecruitr Bullshit. You are paid because you run the 2nd largest validator node. You benefit (&gt;$450k p.a.) from people holding ADA and staking it with you. You are not an objective source of information. It’s always the religious ones that are the most dishonest brokers.
