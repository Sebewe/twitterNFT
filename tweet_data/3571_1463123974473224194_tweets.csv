Where I could read, listen and learn most of the time for absolutely free! 
We need so much more of this as peoples first introduction to NFTs so they understand the space fully before losing bags 💵"
88,They’ve delivered nothing and you only have to look at the average sales (let alone the floor) now to realise people have caught onto the fact they are fucking rubbish
89,"The hyped up shit I bought into early are ones like: @billionclubnft 
@fatapeclub 
@angryapesunited 
There are a bunch more that fully rugged too"
90,"Giving away 1 bluechip NFT, maybe making a metaverse game in the future, access to other ‘successful’ people and we’ll make you rich are NOT utilities"
91,"We all need new people to enter the space so projects than thrive and flourish. 
To attract these new people we need to make it abundantly clear what they are investing Into and what they receive in return."
92,"I bought into a bunch of hype projects early on and missed out on minting some amazing projects (ie @CryptoMories, @BYOPills, @nftworldsNFT…) because I didn’t know any better."
93,"Liquidity drain affects the new investor most. 
How quick are you going to exit NFTs if you’re losing on hyped projects you’ve seen on Instagram (personally fucking hate NFT on Insta - nothing but paid BS)
Talk about giving NfTs a bad rep."
94,"Draining a crazy amount of liquidity from the whole NFT ecosystem. 
Quality projects floors plummet as people undercut to liquidate for the chance of a ‘Hape’ style cash in
The NFT trader numbers are so small at this early stage a drain the size of pixelmon hurts"
95,"I can’t wait for the time that NFTs are promoted and rated by their utility first- before the art.
