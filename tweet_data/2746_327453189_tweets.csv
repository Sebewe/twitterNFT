8,@ErrorZer0invest Does it?
9,The good thing about ETH being low is jpegs are cheap. The bad thing is jpegs are cheap.
10,@lebranchdaniel I prefer ethereum L2s. They inherit its security and decentralization. The art on tezos is good though.
11,@DiscoverXnft A car is the worst investment.
12,@DiscoverXnft 😂
13,I'll buy pudgy penguins at 0.
14,"@nanappot @RSKsmart @SovrynBTC I know. It’s a compromise, and nobody seems to care about them."
15,It doesn't make any sense to spend $1.3M on this. https://t.co/SGLYJdJ9kW

30,The person that started the whitelist giveaway trend “retweet and tag 3 friends...“ has to be put IN JAIL.

37,@machiavillain_1 @fcflio Dope.
38,@metakry I think they didn't include weth.
39,@Nate_Rivers @john_inu_curry I'm with you.
40,@metakry I agree but right now I think we're still early if we compare to other airdrops. I'll try to wait a bit. 🤷‍♂️
41,"@metakry I mean, looks if you sold at the right time, it was amazing. I sold too early."
42,I'm staking.
43,X2Y2 airdrop. 4709.0% APR. What do we do? 🤔
44,@MontyMedici @PuffYatty Agree with those 3. I say clone because Nike is the blue chip.
45,"@PuffYatty - BAYC

47,@drewcoffman This is how they're funding the dao. It's not going in Andrew's pockets.
48,@NathanHeadPhoto Nah.
49,RT @CultCryptoArt: Let's get this started properly. Our logo designed by @XCOPYART is CC0 from the get go. Anyone can remix and create with…
50,@jakethedegen You know what to do.
51,@vvipvestige 🔥
52,@nanimalsNFT Sure it’s possible. They have to make their mark until then.
53,@_boredcactus Yes.
54,@chibiapegang 💯 these rpg maker looking games won’t look great when the game industry comes in.
55,"Azuki is great, but what happens when real anime series release their own pfp project?"
56,@DiscoverXnft Let’s hope the devs fix it.

60,"ETH is backed by DeFi, Web3, NFTs, L2s, stakers, burns and any other smart contracts. What is BTC backed by?"
61,Ready to outperform everything with 100% Ethereum ETF in my retirement account.
62,@CapetainTrippy XCOPY.
63,"Some say NFTs are overpriced, but If you think about it, they’re art, community, social tokens, digital flex, tokenized stocks, game items, membership access… all together, in a fluid market. I would say that’s underpriced."
64,"If trad art was fluid and easy to buy, it would sell for much more. That’s NFTs."
65,@twitter do something.
66,Is there a way to mute everyone with “DM for promotion” in their bio.
67,@Nate_Rivers This is all utility projects these days.
68,"“What’s your eth address?” It’s literally my name, ser."
69,@0x_fxnction All of them.
70,@EclecticMethod Saving on gas fees. How do you think they made 1.8 billion?
71,@geniexyz Can someone sweep ETH’s floor.

76,"@MotivateMeV2 @cryptoadzNFT Thanks. I did see you clarifying on discord after that fact. That’s why I posted the screenshots. The video is well done indeed, congrats."
77,"@blocknoob_ Yeah, but seeing how many people asked if it was a super bowl commercial shows that it was misleading."
78,"@junkpunkie Yeah, that was for the budlight tweet. The screenshot were to show the commercial is unofficial since the teaser didn’t say."
79,@MotivateMeV2 @cryptoadzNFT My tweet was addressed to budlight social media people. I posted the discord screenshot to show it’s unofficial because people didn’t know. You can see with how many people asked if it was a super bowl commercial.
80,@junkpunkie I was just showing he said it’s unofficial cause people were asking me. That’s not ripping.
81,@0x_Capital 😅
82,"@0x_Capital Wdym, Bud Light quote tweeted the teaser. Don't tell me that's not misleading."
83,"@RobertStamos Yeah, the worst part is the tweet I quoted from budlight. Very misleading."
84,@bryanbrinkman 👋
85,What about saying its unofficial on twitter @cryptoadzNFT? https://t.co/N7gWpR5IgK

89,@opensea Move Grifters by XCOPY to its own collection.
90,@marcvs @Twitter Maybe it was the other way around?
91,The latter. https://t.co/NvVBcdxCrO
92,"@rexwub They don’t. Maybe a token, but I wouldn’t buy an nft for merch, events or subpar games that’s for sure."
93,@vvipvestige @xcopy @SuperRichHumans Make a “Right-click save as” one.
94,"@randytorres_ The wallet creation has to come natively on your device, from Apple, or it can't be trusted."
95,@XCOPYART Anything other than #1 is a scam.
96,@iamDCinvestor The back of your head looks rare af ser.
97,@ErrorZer0invest You’re saying more people buying iPhones because they have a hardware wallet integrated is not good for apple?
98,@ape6743 When web2 reveal?
99,That would bridge the good UI of iOS wallet apps with the security of a hardware wallet without compromise.
