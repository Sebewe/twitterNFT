and DAMN do people feel refreshed by that"
16,"@doodles @Poolsuite everything turns into ad extraction, brand loyalty programs, means to a transactional end 

you are a fungible little atom/bit/user, same as life in a big corporate city, with no agency or consent or meaningful participation"
17,literally no web2 community/platform can make someone feel like @doodles or @Poolsuite do
18,"sure, NFTs can be driven by hype/speculation 

but the other side is the feeling of being free again, the fresh air of an open web

i’m no lawyer but think ppl like royal are taking on a behemoth industry &amp; will end up a massive target on their back"
