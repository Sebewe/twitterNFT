1,"@0xObsydian @MFSouthHammer @LIrakleidis @WonderPals I get it now, @coreinth and @WonderPals won't address their contract/site miscalculating the max gas for the public phase mint because of 278+ txs which their site/contract provided a max gas calculation of around 85K for a mint that required approx 95K

3,"@cryptoeducated @WonderPals My point is, with the floor price already falling and the reveal coming soon, it’s highly likely the floor price will continue to fall 

My opinion is, their roadmap doesn’t increase the value proposition of the project 

@WonderPals may do well short term, it will not long term"
4,"@cryptoeducated @WonderPals True. 

Although, we typically see the floor rise into reveal then pullback or crash after reveal with many buyers that either didn’t pull a rare and/or don’t appreciate the art dumping supply on to the market. There’s always a chance @WonderPals is different.

5,"@cryptoeducated @WonderPals Unfortunately, with a roadmap that consists of an “online gift shop” and “many ideas for the future” this tweet was bound not to age well
