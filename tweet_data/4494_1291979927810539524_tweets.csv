38,@sayinshallah @dudemyguymanbro That really doesn't do anything. Applying for a loan hits you negatively (for a time). Closing a loan erases it. It's key to have a LOAN OPEN that you pay off all the time but stays open. Use a no fee CC or a heloc. They're good emergency funds anyways. Use each once a month
39,"@sayinshallah Also, freeze your credit when you're not or done applying for ccs or loans. You can free Transunion, Experian, and Equifax easy. FREEZE THEM ALL. This prevents anyone from using your info to get credit."
40,"@sayinshallah &gt;payment history = 100% (dispute anything in your record)
&gt;have credit cards / loans = get no fee cc or open ended loans like helocs, watch out if you don't use them they'll close em

46,@RaidersRescue @safetyth1rd Trying to canonize people in crypto is misguided IMO. They're humans that want to get paid/clout. Even Vitalik has personal opinions that some people don't like. The space is simply too fluid for anyone to be an authority on any matter. That's a GOOD thing.
