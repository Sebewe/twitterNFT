4,"I eventually want @tastytoastys to adopt communities that have been abandoned by their devs. It’s bound to happen in this frothy mkt. 

We piloted this idea during our minting period by offering free mints to @SushiSurvivors. 

All are welcome in our Toasty space. 🍞 https://t.co/Gz9IiVehOP"

Wen clone?"
11,"I love going back to projects I already know about / have seen building since last year, and learning about their progress. I learn so much more than spending time evaluating new projects, even if the latter can be very profitable for quick flips."
12,"@wooitsjeff @CyberKongz it really is cute!!!!! &amp; Cyberkongz is launching their Play-2-Kollect soon, I wanna run around with this haha"
13,"@CyberKongz PS: I got this for the same price that my other one got sold for, so effectively I'm continuing where I left off (sans gas). Wew."
14,"My 2nd ever NFT purchase in 2021 was a @cyberkongz VX. Earlier this year, the floor rose before I noticed &amp; delisted, &amp; it was the most painful sale ever. I never thought I'd be UNhappy to make profit. WTF.

42,@vnstr_eth @winterbearsnft @Pixelmon @ad1vs_ @TryToBuyCrypto I’m exhausted. I frankly want everything to crash so the good projects can build in peace / the space stops attracting the wrong sort of people. Instead of the attention always being redirected to the next flashy thing which absorbs liquidity from the market &amp; hurts newcomers.
43,"@vnstr_eth @Pixelmon @ad1vs_ @TryToBuyCrypto @winterbearsnft everyone in this space is just drunk on the possibility of instant &amp; quick gains, and the current market incentives reward this sort of behaviour. Not enough people have been burnt yet."
