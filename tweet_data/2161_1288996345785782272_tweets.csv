16,@coldpizza_eth @taylor___fisher The space is brand new lol - there aren’t a lot of execs that can see the potential and truly understand the project - while being proven and successful.

62,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin While also giving you one example on this dumb bird app that does want to experiment and see if we cannot create something greater for all people across the world, not to scam or to make a quick buck. Appreciate your time and perspective, thanks for being open to a conversation"
63,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin Oh I know, you’ve told me plenty of times 😂 but I’m not discouraged - it’s the same reasoning and hesitations that have been applied to all major technological/scientific advancement. Neither of us know, so it carries the same outcome of “only time will tell”"
64,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin So if they CAN help SOME things - how do we determine what makes sense and what doesn’t if we don’t try, experiment, and iterate?"
65,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin And that’s a matter of perspective right? To me, someone being able to play a web browser game for a day and make more money than they would in the month is a “game changing” effect. It doesn’t mean axie is the way of the future but maybe they’re onto something worth exploring"
66,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin If not anything else just know I hear you, and want to listen and address your concerns. Because I genuinely do want a future that is better for all people - and in my opinion smart contracts and decentralized oracles can help us achieve that."
67,@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin Centralized things are much easier to manage but crypto is putting decentralization at the forefront more than anything else in the past imo. We don’t know how to address the problems until we encounter them and it’s never been at this scale. It takes time but we should still try
68,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin My apologies, as you have repeated that it is a “waste” and a “distraction” I interpreted as “this technology is not worth pursuing”. But also it’s literally brand new, and just because there are problems doesn’t mean it should be dismissed,  it means we should tackle them imo"
69,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin Ultimately to me that makes me hopeful. I don’t even think that axie IS the solution or best game out there by any means - but because they are experimenting it makes us challenge our beliefs as to what is possible, and to strive to build something better"
70,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin I mean this harkens back to the original tweet. Scams are a huge problem, but there are scams in every facet of our lives. That doesn’t mean this technology is doomed because of that"
71,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin Again, seems premature to dismiss it as a waste. Axie prices didn’t start high, the demand caused the price to 🚀. they recognized the issue and their solution was “scholarships” allowing those in impoverished countries to play and earn $600/month compared to pennies a day."
72,@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin NFTs can combine the upside of a billion dollar brand with a Kickstarter entry point. Its like if any product you buy came with equity in the project/artist. How many scientific advancements would we have missed out on if they were dismissed as distractions before experimenting?
73,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin To me were at the dawn of a new era  where we can leverage the technology to make things more equitable for all creators, and they get their fair share. Which is why I want your perspective, esp if you think this isn’t one of the best opportunities to change the landscape."
74,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin I used it to highlight the magnitude of change experienced in one facet of technology where the current “leader” in the space is now just a historical footnote and not part of the ecosystem. Because users could get so much more , they just didn’t realize it until it was present."
75,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin Just as walkmans were the closest realization of all your music in one place.
We couldn’t have imagined a better solution until one was built - where you could access ALL music via a streaming service. That faced the same legal/technical interop hurdles but here we are w/ Spotify"
76,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin But that token acts as a built-in certificate of authenticity, that gives one piece more value than all the others. 

I guess the bigger question is - do you think something like the Oasis from RP1 is feasible or not to you. And if it is, how would it be built?"
77,RT @ohhshiny: It’s fitting Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook to Meta because it’s about to be Meta vers us.
78,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin But an original piece from an artist will always be worth more than the print you pick up at the store. Now there are certified digital originals. As a VR enthusiast , wouldn’t a single account housing all your achievements and loot across ALL your games and interests be ideal?"
79,"@tacolamp @sterlingcrispin Did you illustrate your cover photo? A dinosaur in a jet is fucken sweet, and I’d happily purchase it if you created it. While I think there are way more usecases- at a minimum does it not give artists around the world access to instant global distribution? Is that “shady” ?"
