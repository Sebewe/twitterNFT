https://t.co/FBBTDfC6CJ"
34,"@OpenNFT @t_b_b_s @Jiran_z @opensea If a contract does not have approval it cannot withdraw or move your asset. So yes that would also work. It is worth mentioning though that this is usually going to apply to all assets in that contract. So in this case, if you had two apes neither would be trade-able."
35,@restivo @opensea Very true. I'd make it an opt-out process. Better to be safe. Then give ways to check if you have outstanding orders on items you've sold. Some part of the user dashboard. That plus notifications when you get an item back that has outstanding valid orders would be pretty stellar
36,"@t_b_b_s @Jiran_z @opensea Yes and no, the point is that if you have the listing, you don't need OS to do it. People thought they were safe because it was delisted. But if the assets is in your wallet, and an order that's valid is in the hands of someone else, they CAN match it"
37,"With this new responsibility comes a need for deeper knowledge about what we're interacting with. A centralized entity could have prevented this, but that isn't the ecosystem we're in anymore.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

15/15"
38,"Unfortunately one of the big learning curves about web3 comes from its benefit. We are now much more responsible for the things we own electronically. 

14/15"
39,"There are also best practices you can follow.

1. Always cancel existing orders on items before you transfer them
2. Revoke approval for @opensea to withdraw items for the order matching workflow.
3. Maintain separate wallets. Things you like stay in a vault.

13/15"
40,"I see two opportunities here.

1. When transferring an asset using the @opensea UI, it could instead call a deployed proxy contract that cancels existing orders THEN actually does the transfer
2. @opensea could detect this case and notify you to cancel the old order.

12/15"
41,"@opensea doesn't have control over this part, they can't cancel an order for you. They can't revoke your approval to have the item taken out of your wallet. Nor can an exchange contract detect if an item was moved and invalidate orders that were hypothetically valid before.
11/15"
42,"So with an order sitting around unable to be matched because the transaction would fail. With no expiration, and no cancellation, all that was left is for the asset to return to the owner of the wallet. Now the order is valid again. A taker can come in and match it.

10/15"
43,"You would think that because the item was transferred out of the wallet that originally owned it would be enough. Indeed, it would stop the order from being matchable. That does not mean the order cannot be valid. You just can't submit a transaction to match it yet.

9/15"
44,"So let's play what happened here out. 

An order was made that puts an item up for sale with no expiration date. So this order will be valid unless it:
1. Matches (can only match once)
2. Is Cancelled
3. Expires

The order in question was made 5 months ago
8/15 https://t.co/bdxZ1EXdj1"
45,"Really, an order contains the following:

7/15 https://t.co/KfLh46ydGi"
46,"An order has a few relevant fields when we consider how this scenario can play out. One of them was called out by @chan0_. That's the expiration.
https://t.co/MMIH0p3eru

6/15"
47,"The maker creates their order and signs for it, verifying that they ""approve"" their order. This then gets stored in some centralized database.

The taker then retrieves the stored maker side of the order, and submits their side with it. A sale happened.

5/15"
48,"Without diving too deep into the details, an order has two sides. Maker and Taker.

4/15"
49,"How does this work? To explain that, we need to take a look at the contract used by @opensea for Ethereum sales. Project Wyvern Exchange
https://t.co/erdCeA2zja

3/15"
50,"On OpenSea, it's free to make an order. That is, it does not cost anything to either list an item for sale, or to make an offer on an existing item.
