5,@TopherGreen4 @chrismaddern What is frustrating about it? Just curious since you replied that is the hardest thing to keep track of.
6,@TopherGreen4 @chrismaddern I meant how to you track and manage official announcements? Do you just check discord constantly or something else?
7,@TopherGreen4 @chrismaddern How do you do this today and what could be better?

16,@berrybelly83 @4ever_nft @TheSnoopAvatars @metalinklabs Can you check under Other Collections and click on one of the doggie channels to see if you get in?
17,"@4ever_nft @berrybelly83 @TheSnoopAvatars @metalinklabs So we learned the service we are using to get data from the blockchain was weirdly not accurate for the doggies collection so we had to use our backup which can take a few hours sometimes. Sorry for the issues, we just want to make sure all data is accurate.

Can you check again?"
18,@berrybelly83 @TheSnoopAvatars @metalinklabs metalink username or eth address? i can check for you
19,@berrybelly83 @TheSnoopAvatars @metalinklabs Did you sign in with the wallet you have your doggie in?  You can link multiple wallets in the profile settings.
