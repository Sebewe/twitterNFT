6,"@jai_bhavnani I think this is only true if the rich own the means of production.

Historically, the wealthy have been able to abuse their position in the market to have asymmetric access/information.

The goal of true, community-owned decentralized public goods is to fix this asymmetry.

17,"@jemenger Why not scale across more venues in the same city first? 

There was some venue fragmentation at EthDenver but the majority of folks were at the castle which was always super packed.

Should split up stages more and explicitly *let hackers/booths have their own location*"

45,"@FrancescoRenziA @dmihal @ASvanevik @ConnextNetwork @nomadxyz_ Yes, the idea is to head towards using the best possible mechanism for a given chain. 

On a rollup, this means utilizing the specific benefits of a rollup AMB."
46,"@Bisarka @pristineindigo7 @legendarymrpopo @cosmos Instead, I think cosmos is much better suited to be an important building block for web3 infra/middleware projects.

https://t.co/0uMMvZNQNg"
47,"@Bisarka @pristineindigo7 @legendarymrpopo @cosmos I don't like the ""app-specific chain"" marketing. It implies that cosmos applications are going to be directly competitive with Eth DeFi.

That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. It will always be 100x easier to build a DeFi application in solidity."
48,"@pedrouid @RHLSTHRM @cosmos E.g. using tendermint POS as consensus layer for fees when decentralizing rollup sequencers.

Connext is planning to do something similar for fair routing/fees.

Both are infra usecases that require cheap DA and *cannot* (and probably should not) live in a smart contract."
49,"@pedrouid @RHLSTHRM @cosmos Not exactly - I specifically mean that there is a market for achieving consensus on things where that thing doesn't require the security or expressivity of Ethereum L1.

IMO Cosmos is really powerful for lower level infra/web3 projects that exist outside the app layer"
50,@FrancescoRenziA @dmihal @ASvanevik @ConnextNetwork @nomadxyz_ Nomad + Connext will be a part of the cross-rollup experience and inherit a lot of the same core security mechanisms

61,"Tokens aren't perfect, but represent a possible sustainable model for public goods on the internet.

E.g. Search on the internet is a public good. Operating it privately (Google) leads to broken incentives and externalities (selling consumer data). https://t.co/c7CiSOE1rP"
62,"@sayinshallah The point here is that there is a class of  activities where revenue is generated (e.g. selling goods on a marketplace) and a different class of activities where a platform or public service is provided (e.g. the marketplace itself).

The corp model is totally broken for latter."
63,"@sayinshallah This model, however is sometimes fundamentally incompatible with the products they're associated with.

Take Google search for example. Search on the internet is and needs to be public infra. No (privatized) corporate model can provide search for free forever. But a DAO could."
64,"@sayinshallah I think driver for this is that traditional corps have to base their model on recurring revenue.

This forces their owners to capitulate and try to extract value. This can happen through platform fees, but also more exploitative means (e.g. selling user data)."
65,"@sayinshallah And even when they do get involved, control largely remains in the hands of board/PE funds.

This appears to happen to all companies. Even if founders retain control for a long period and keep the initial culture/vision alive, they will eventually be replaced (forcibly)."
66,"@sayinshallah Ive actually done a 180 on my thinking on this over the past couple of years.

Incentives for equity-based orgs drive them towards either acquisition or IPO. In both cases, there is a massive centralization risk as retail is barred from being involved until the latest stages."
67,"@sayinshallah @blknoiz06 I think there's pretty meaningful utility to use a token to decentralize the sequencer role.

Sequencers bond token to win rights to fees for a given block - similar to the work/staking model from the Graph or Livepeer."

It's only a matter of time before we start seeing economic exploits in addition to smart contract ones like today.

Options like @nomadxyz_ are better."
90,"@iamDCinvestor That said, multisig bridges are shit for other reasons and people should stop using them immediately.

Use Connext instead."
91,"@iamDCinvestor I'm a STRONG proponent of rollups, but I dont think what happened today is actually bullish for anything.

Rollups can not only have the same problem, but also introduce far greater attack surface around EVM execution which can also be exploited."
92,"@0xmirichael @alltejuupptaget @iamDCinvestor Eh? No, this is not really true.

Yes, many bridges are trusted (bc they rely on multisigs) and rollup bridges don't have this issue.

However, the implementation complexity of rollups and rollup bridges is FAR higher than a multisig."
