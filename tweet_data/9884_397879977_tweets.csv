1,"2 of my best. One collected and one uncollected, up on Tux.

Really impressed by the changes Vince is implementing to the platform. I’m hoping collectors start to take more notice. It is where I will be posting what I consider to be my finest work.

49,"It didn't feel right to me to be using the current situation as leverage for a sale, only to give a small portion to the cause. 

I hope this image can find a collector and we can make a small difference together.

RT's would be so appreciated.

50,"Like you, i'm pretty disgusted by what's happening in Ukraine. The only way i feel i can help in any way is to donate some money to a worthy cause.

Therefore, i've decided that 100% of proceeds of this sale will go to the Red Cross.

88,Apologies for the Twitter video compression. Finding it to be a real creative killer when you can’t display your work the way you want it to be seen
