54,"Blockchain tech &amp; crypto are rapidly changing our world... just like the internet did 30 years ago

Stay up to date by liking, following, and RTing"
55,Thanks to @a16z for these definitions https://t.co/5NZ4fPIh7G
56,"16) Hard Fork

A hard fork happens when nodes in the network fail to reach consensus. 

In this case, the blockchain splits into two or more branches at the last point of agreement, and new valid blocks accepted on one fork will be rejected by the other."
57,"15) Soft Fork

A soft fork does not result in a permanent split of the network and is more akin to a network migration or upgrade. 

In other words, nodes on the network remain compatible with one another.

It often occurs during software upgrades to the protocol."
58,"14) Fork

A fork is a disagreement between nodes. 

The disagreement can be about what code is being run, or which blocks are included in the blockchain. 

Such a disagreement causes the blockchain to split into two parallel chains.

There are two types: soft and hard."
59,"13) Miners

Miners are special nodes on a blockchain network that:

1) Validate transactions to ensure that they are valid according to the network protocol

2) Compete with one another to find a solution to a random proof-of-work puzzle for a network reward"
60,"12) Block

A block is like a folder that contains “files”. 

The contents of this folder are the transactions that occur over a given time interval. 

Each block contains a reference linking it to the previous block — hence the term “blockchain”"
61,"11) Blockchain

A blockchain is a tamper-proof ledger organized into a series of linked “blocks” containing data. 

These blocks are added via a set of special rules (consensus algorithms), enabling networks of physical computers to work together &amp; form a single virtual computer."
62,"10) Proof-of-Work

Proof-of-work demonstrates the use of a specific resource

In the physical world, the ultimate scarce resource is time, so proof-of-work could be a timecard of hours spent at the office. 

In the digital world, it is proof computational resources were expended"
63,"9) Decentralization

Decentralization is the degree to which control — power, resource allocation, etc. — over a given network is distributed across a large, representative base of independent actors"
64,"8) Consensus

Essentially, the OS of a blockchain

Think of a consensus algorithm as a digital, impartial judge that hears both sides of an argument to arrive at the “truth” of what actually occurred. 

It then determines how to proceed via a set of predetermined laws or rules"
65,"7) Node

A node is a device that participates in a network by following the network protocol. 

Individual nodes can perform a variety of roles, such as caching data, validating information, or forwarding messages to other nodes"
66,"6) Peer-to-Peer (p2p) Network

p2p networks are a group of devices that are connected together to create a network

Once formed, they can be used to share &amp; store files. In any p2p network, all the nodes generally have equal power and can use the same tasks"
67,"5) Protocol

A protocol is a set of rules or procedures that govern a system — whether a computer network, a town hall meeting, or a board game.

Ex: in chess, players have their own strategies — but the way each chess piece moves is dictated by the rules (or protocol)"
68,"4) Digital Signature

Digital signatures are unique to a single person or entity. They're mathematically derived from a pair of public + private keys. 

Just like a real signature, a digital signature shows the recipient that the message is authentic."
69,"3) Public Key

Public keys are a second key/value derived from a private key when a special mathematical function is applied to create a second value, a public key.

If a private key is a physical key that unlocks your front door, then the public key is the address of your house"
70,"2) Private Key

A private key is an extremely large number that is used in cryptography, similar to a password. 

They're used to create digital signatures that can easily be verified &amp; show ownership of a blockchain address"
71,"1) Ledger

A ledger is a list of transactions

Those transactions don’t necessarily have to be payments

They can represent transfers of any asset, such as real estate deeds or interest-bearing security"

94,"If you found this helpful, please share your predictions for the future of Smart Contracts in the comments. Thanks for reading!"
95,"10) Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)

DPoS is a type of consensus that limit the number of validators who can add blocks to the blockchain. 

These validators are selected through some type of network governance mechanism — for example, by a token-weighted vote per user account."
96,"9) Proof-of-Stake

In a proof-of-stake system, “validators” post a bond or “stake” to a smart contract, earning rewards or “interest” for properly validating the state of the blockchain."
97,"8) Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

NFTs represent unique assets whose value is independent from one another. 

For example, an NFT might represent a piece of unique digital artwork, a Mickey Mantle baseball card, or a share of physical North Carolina real estate."
98,"7) Fungibility

Fungibility” means that units of a currency or commodity are alike and indistinguishable. 

Examples of fungible currencies are $1 bills, each of which is alike and represents the same value."
99,"6) Tokens

Tokens are digital representations of an asset: either a native digital asset or credit for some type of “work” or service (like gigabytes of files stored). 

Tokens are not crypto themselves, but rather are issued from smart contracts"
