44,https://t.co/iqHrJYEmQM
45,"And I cannot thank my collectors enough. Those who’ve bought pieces from this collection have contributed so much to improving my cats’ lives. If any of you want to pick up any of the remaining pieces, there’s 6 left! Join the cat colony today, and become part of the family 😼 https://t.co/Jnig43Wy90"
46,"I decided to write this thread on sort of a whim, so excuse the mindless ramblings and the not so well made points I was attempting to emphasize here😹 but if you made it this far I truly appreciate you so much. It’s ppl like you that have gotten me to where I am today❤️ https://t.co/dMgzOsdTPn"
47,"it’s all natural behavior on the kitties’ part that helps to create these photos, and I honestly prefer it that way. I think it’s as real and as you can get, and I believe when shooting with animals, that is the best way to do it."
48,"I just prefer to sit there, and vibe with the kitties. That’s it. The cats will literally start playing as soon as I sit down in the grass and start chillin. They’ll run around, chase each other, climb trees(but not too high up thankfully), jump around, roll around, etc. https://t.co/rhhE6w6VUi"
49,"I don’t dangle toys in their face, I try not to do any sort of extra bs to get some shots of them in any particular positions or stances(tho I do not have issues with anyone doing that and there’s DEFINITELY a time and a place for play time!)😹"
50,"Relationships like that, which I’ve created with these cats, are quintessential to getting these photos. And imo, it’s what makes my work all the more authentic. https://t.co/CYnU9qqdkM"
51,"So I was patient with him. I did not rush things, I didn’t try to put him in situations where he might get stressed, and any development in our relationship I saw as an accomplishment. And before I knew it, he started following me everywhere I’d go when I’d head out to shoot. https://t.co/4rLg6laewE"
52,"Kitties like Big Boy showed signs of past trauma/abuse. He used to be so skittish, that he’d run away when I started putting the food out for the cats to eat. He used to shy away as soon as I’d try to pet him. He was very to himself, and spent most of his time alone for some time https://t.co/OaDw5oLW9A"
53,"5/ if you look at these photos and you look at the cats’ eyes, they’re communicating the amount of trust and love they have for me. And I do not say this to shine myself on, creating bonds with each of these kitties took time, and some of them, their trust wasn’t easily won over. https://t.co/6WzBj7LYqD"
54,"4/ And I’ve noticed something rlly interesting about these photos. In a lot of them, the cats’ eyes tell you all you need to know about the relationships I share with each and every one of them. I didn’t realize this until some fellow artists and collectors mentioned this to me. https://t.co/JUnprPB2PS"
55,"Which is why caring for them as much as I can, spending time with them, and also photographing them are some of my biggest priorities now more than ever. Spending my days with the kitties creates these memories that I truly live for creating. https://t.co/sdDJXbhiK6"
56,"2/ Over the years, these cats have legitimately become my family. And while I am able to watch over them and care for their needs, nature can be unforgiving at times. I’ve had cats who lived on for years upon years, and cats who disappeared within a year of being born."
57,1/🧵Some of my favorite pieces that got picked up since I’ve released this collection. Each of these photos represents an important memory I got to share with each of my cats. The act of minting photos like these was partly out the necessity to hold onto those important memories https://t.co/DsRzIxmwLv
