27,@Hajro_eth @superplastic It had to close at one point to affirm accounts that were bots or not. A lot of people joining at once led to server crashes for many people
28,@Adubbs1987 @superplastic All info was sent in the discord. It sounds like you don’t have full context because you couldn’t get back in after the original links were exploited. For the last two time slots there were some accounts that experienced crash issues and others that didn’t
