53,@dost_geni @litcapital @opensea @coolcatsnft are sound money. Ludwig Von Mises said so himself.
54,"@dost_geni @litcapital @opensea Also the argument in the first place presupposes that the content only has value because the content is visible. I don't think that's true, and even if IPFS didn't exist you could imagine a world where the community wraps tokens and points to another URI."
55,"@dost_geni @litcapital @opensea The extent to which NFTs aren't minted with content addressing is the extent to which NFTs aren't being minted properly. That's not an NFT issue, that's human error. This is a solved problem, and has been much longer than the anti-NFT crowd has been around."
56,@dost_geni @litcapital @opensea If an NFT is minted with an address such as ipfs://{cid} or even just https://t.co/ih00Ms3UTL then the content is definitionally recoverable. The former being better. You do not require opensea to be an IPFS node in that model. Simply run your own node to host the content for it.

60,"2/ But because NFTs are so universally hated now there's real brand-risk for YouTube rolling it out. I hope they do, I'd love to invest in creators early. Same for Twitch, same for TikTok etc. etc."
61,1/ The NFT hate is only deepening the wealth gap. NFTs were meant to be a way to capitalise creators getting started. Imagine you see some banger video on YouTube but it's getting no views. Imagine if you could buy the NFT of that video and receive future ad revenue.
