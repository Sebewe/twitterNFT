17,"Interesting read - some may say CIOs and CISOs should be peers, but one thing is for sure, and my peers in industry have been saying this for a long time, security should not report to IT. Unfortunately this is still the case at many companies. #infosec

26,"@warriors - feels so good to be back to watch, 2+ years! https://t.co/229aprEpZ5"
27,@bl_6620 It’s important to do research about the company you’re selling to. Is the CISO the right person? Is your product relevant to the company you? If yes - then the best way to get their attention - via their network or email/LinkedIn- but you have to offer something useful.
28,@AccidentalCISO +1. Break just started and I already want them back in school on Monday.

35,Security and Privacy are most effective when they are championed from the top most executives at a company. Grassroots efforts can make small impact but will rarely change the culture to care about these topics. #infosec #privacy
36,"“But for Biles, control isn’t just about winning; it can be the difference between life and death.”

“Avoiding disaster requires a constant, firm grip on mental acuity.”

Such a powerful read on mental health. #Mentalhealth #MentalHealthMatters
