82,"@undef_obj @mohit @TheSwaminator After investigating CLI source code I decided to use the resources.addCfnResource method to manually add the AWS::Lambda::Permission resources+properties to create the invoke permissions, but this isn't documented anywhere"
83,@undef_obj @mohit @TheSwaminator The override.ts seems to want the resources.lambdaConfigPermissions property but it's typed to accept entries of lambda.cfnPermission which isn't possible to instantiate that class because override.ts doesn't allow importing the cdk / logic is executed inside a VM  &amp; no fs access

With hack to import amplify-meta I've been able to determine the resource parameters typically provided by the CLI in the cloudformation templates. However there's also the need to create the LambdaInvoke permissions, not documented"
85,@undef_obj @mohit @TheSwaminator based on the issues threads I saw people need a way to set their custom trigger configurations via the override.ts but there's no way of obtaining the standard environmental info like the lambda name/lambda arn without a hacky work round to require the amplify-meta.json file
86,@undef_obj @mohit @TheSwaminator @undef_obj The latest amplify v7 asks to migrate our auth category when working with it viaAmplify CLI. The override.ts documentation's a bit opaque when looking to translate all the customizations made in the cloudformation template which now's deleted as part of the migration
87,@hackerswagger Ah yes i remember running into those same limitations when I was using Datastore to build an offline first mobile app. I’ve never used Datastore again and just use Appsync/Graohql and have a lot more control
88,@hackerswagger that's a really interesting point! was this because of multiple required subscriptions on the same model?
