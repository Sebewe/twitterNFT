1,@RunHSL Thanks! I'm going to experiment a bit. Right now I see a lot of interesting stuff following so many people so trying not to lose too much of that.
2,@RunHSL Lists maybe?
3,@RunHSL How'd you accomplish this? Did you mute people you were following manually or is there some setting I'm not aware of?
4,"Anyone else make a twitter just for NFTs and feel like they spend way too much time on it? I don't even tweet that much but I feel like I'm addicted to scrolling. Haven't had social media for a long, long time. How do you all balance it?"
5,@buckselec Happy it was useful for someone!
6,"Just in case anyone still opens #Discord dms every time they need to verify via captcha bot: Add the bot to a private server and enable dms for that server, then you won't have to temporarily allow dms in new servers. Especially relevant for anyone joining #NFT servers."

17,RT @BAYC2745: Am I dreaming
18,@al_hemyariii Uh... They're not minting til February 23rd. I hope you didn't get scammed.
19,@al_hemyariii Not quite sure yet. I think I'll wait to see how the mint goes before forming a final opinion.
20,"@apeatalu1 NFTs maybe, but I feel like a lot of cryptocurrencies exist for the exact kind of person who wouldn't be on twitter. I was one of them until a little while after I got into NFTs and decided I couldn't go without a Twitter any longer."
21,"nft mfers love to tell you how greedy an 8.88 ETH mint price is but then go around tweeting shit like ""wen lambo"""
22,"@StrayCryptoDog @psychedelic_nft I feel that! So many good projects, so little time... And then there's the financial side of getting into a new one."
23,"@CryptoBatzNFT Might as well, right? https://t.co/cWbO7wJTnc"
24,At what point do you stop being a collector and instead become a hoarder? 🤔
25,"@andrwwang What really made NFTs make sense to me was the first - of the digital items I collected, few were resalable, and none would continue to exist should the company behind them disappear."
26,"@andrwwang Various things over the years. I've collected digital items in games in the past, fountain pens, and watches to list the more material items. But also achievements in video games and data (probably the latter for memories, I guess?) - not an exhaustive list ofc!"
27,Reading through the PA update and I see the next auction is imminent. Better prepare my wallet...
28,Can we make it a requirement for ruggers to post youtuber-style apologies when they're caught? Imagine the potential.
29,@glizzies_eth Love that you owned it. It happens!

33,@BAYC2745 @psychedelic_nft @Twitter Haven't changed since I got it. https://t.co/NOYtohvdjh
34,@NFTethics I think the issue lies with desperation. People need to take their time. Make sure contracts are safe before buying. Maybe to reconcile the two trusted parties could offer code audits and people would look for those if they can't read the code themselves.
35,@NFTethics Lot of bored/crazy people come after others for no reason online as well besides that they can. See: streamer swat incidents.
36,@NFTethics Valid reasons not to doxx yourself as well. People can and do target others online even if they do nothing wrong. As far as I can tell the people who run this account aren't doxxed and I don't think they should be. Bad actors could come for revenge when exposed by you.
37,@NFTethics Demanding doxxing is just a shortcut people ask for to avoid doing their own research. Plenty of doxxed people can and do walk away from projects and go make new ones without reputational damage. It's not a valid substitute.
38,"@NFTethics Understand why people want this but I strongly disagree. Everyone has a right to privacy. If we try to enforce this web3 will go the same direction as web2. Easy to fake a 'real identity', and if we wanted to verify think about who we'd have to rely on. More reasons to follow."
39,@0xQuit Any legitimate reason a project would want to hide their contract? I can't think of one.
40,Shouldn't it be normal to let people see your contract prior to launch so they have time to make sure it's safe and there are no issues? Is there any reason a project wouldn't? I'd be wary of any project that didn't want people to see their contract.
41,"@al_hemyariii I get it, I really do. I've long since given up on getting on white lists myself - I just don't have the time to grind it out and I don't want to turn my twitter into a bunch of giveaway retweets."
42,"@al_hemyariii You can release a collection with art considered ""bad"" and still provide something of value - maybe there is some utility to go with the NFT. But you'd still show the art upfront in that case, I would think - or you risk losing the community you built because they'll feel lied to"
43,@al_hemyariii That's my problem.
44,@al_hemyariii It's not so much about the quality so much as people being so desperate to get in first to a new project that they are willing to spread something before even seeing what is (supposedly) being offered.
45,Wishful thinking but I think we should hold new projects to a higher standard here. Interacting with these types of projects just means we will see more of them.
46,While I understand wanting to get in early and secure a whitelist/presale spot (and thus following/retweeting/whatever) I personally don't think it's worth it until they've shown art. I'd hate for someone to find out about a project that turns out to be a rug through me.
47,"Surely if you planned to release NFTs worth buying, you'd show at least some of the art off ASAP."
48,I don't get the recent trend of projects that start promoting without any art. IMO it implies they have none.
49,@crispystonks Congrats! So happy to see someone winning one of these.

61,"Key points include a quick history of relevant projects, things to be aware of (including how to avoid common scams, for instance), relevant supporting material about crypto would be helpful as I'm not sure of their level of familiarity with that either."
62,"News articles from big, general publications are too broad. News articles I'm seeing from nft-specific sites are too specific (on the level of specific projects that are new and upcoming, often ones that aren't yet relevant). Looking for a good balance."
63,"If someone came to you interested in #NFTs, is there a good starting point you'd recommend to them for catching up on everything and giving them a good overview? I can't seem to find what I'm looking for."
64,Less than 24 hours left. Get in while you can 👀
65,"@noodledudeman Thanks for the tip, I'll look into that."
66,"(as verification that I did actually give it away, to be clear)"
67,Planning on posting the twitter picker link + transaction if that's viable. First time doing anything like this so I appreciate any advice people may have.
68,"Time to start that long awaited giveaway. We're starting with 1 extra PA Metaverse pass (#5361) I've been holding on to. To enter:

1. Follow
2. Retweet
3. Reply (Tag 3 friends + include your public wallet address)

Ends 3 PM EST Monday (72 hours).

71,@BAYC2745 @psychedelic_nft Failed to grab the 1/1 at auction so picked up this beauty when someone dmed me about it. https://t.co/XTuFw9dWkR
72,@___Ayahuasca___ Poorly written tweet cause I'm at work but hope it still demonstrates understanding. Feel free to correct me
73,"@___Ayahuasca___ Think I get it now, thanks. I had taken the proof of ownership/authenticity of nfts as being contrary to something like expansion punks but I guess in the context of the CCO narrative it's the opposite."
74,"@___Ayahuasca___ Most of that makes sense, but ""not pretending to be cryptopunks"" is hard for me to believe when they use a similar name + near identical style (even if traits are different). Not trying to pick on xpac punks in specific, seems to me there are similar projects w/ fewer differences"
75,Anyone able to explain the appeal of stuff like expansion punks or similar collections? I don't get buying them in the NFT space where there is so much emphasis on proof of ownership/authenticity. Seems like a lot of people are buying though...?
76,"@PA_1770 @psychedelic_nft @BAYC2745 Just saw this cause I've been getting tagged, would have waited til it was over before doing my giveaway if I knew. Whoops - well, at least mine won't be ending at the same time."
77,"Alright, I've decided. Going to start my first giveaway Friday, 1000 followers or not. Planning on doing a @psychedelic_nft metaverse pass (extra) and then will do more giveaways later of the other PA NFTs. Make sure to follow now so you see it when it starts! #PAFollowPA"
