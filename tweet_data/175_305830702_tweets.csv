4,"@ApeGuevara Great question.

A combo of both - platforms will onboard artists at scale while unique artists will break the economic envelope open.

I expect the largest secondary markets to come from web3-native artists building bespoke solutions after starting on a key Music NFT platform."
5,"@WinandWoo Unfortunately you need to do more than wait and hope to be accepted.

At the current stage, being present and active in the community carries more weight than an existing artist brand.

Join different communities, support other drops and start making waves in web3."

Carry on."
68,"@hbiglin I gave my personal view on this below.

TLDR: You are collecting a rare digital vinyl.

Most don't have ownership, but if the song performs well, it's likely to increase on secondary in the same way any pfp collection does.

69,"@KUUROmusic @rohkiofficial Yes, yes it is🩸"
70,"@TrustlessState I'm noticing more consolidation and a reticence to sharing code.

It's likely just the vertical I'm honing in on, but it feels like a lot more teams are being very protective of IP when it comes to mainstream-focused platforms."
71,"@TrustlessState Scary but (probably) true.

When I see people starting their web3 journey today, they rarely ask how it works, and instead comment on how difficult it is to use.

I'm hopeful we can find a happy medium."
72,"This does not mean the tech is not important.

We need to be very thoughtful about decentralization and security.

With this said, the best products will win."
73,"We are entering a phase of web3 where the product matters more than the tech.

Most people will never look under the hood.

All they care about is a seamless onboarding experience."
74,"Make a living by collecting music from artists that you love.

This future is coming much sooner than you think."
