30,@clorxo End of the year? But 4 Wonderpals and could be by Easter lol
31,"@topshotkief You’ll make way more money doing it free in the long term. Open a discord and chat. Limit the amount in. Then drop an NFT pass. I think the reason people got fired up is you just said just give me .2, then even the people that were intersted came back hours later and it was .5"
32,@LoveKaylos @zachgoeshard @WeatheReportNFT This tbh. Denton feels so much more fire. Not even close

37,@topshotkief @brrrocto I agree but it’s irrelevant cause Cody and vinnie are tied to the mess. I personally think it was mostly Zach but I’m not sure obviously. It’s just unfortunate. I bought a letter at 1.55 for full disclosure
38,@topshotkief I agree but it will take a long time after the drama. Wonderpals all that matters right now. Project of the year
