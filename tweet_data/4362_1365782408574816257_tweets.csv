4,"@AtomoKidsPJB These are totally awesome. Telling the story behind the art is so much better than reading a roadmap, etc. These look like they were fun to create. Do you enjoy the process?"
5,This is how it’s done. Plain and simple. Read this and look at things from a business point of view. Or don’t and just do it for the art. Do it for the plague. @GiancarloChaux @bayc9797 @nfttank https://t.co/0Dw61d0GWe

29,@RachelWolchin Felt so good that I did it twice.
30,"@ThePlagueNFT Only day one. If you build it, they will come. People resonate with reason."
31,"@A_Pons_Asinorum @ThePlagueNFT Seems like every time I am ready to leave this NFT space for good, some project comes along that has that certain factor. Last time was PA. Now it’s the Plague. Unique founders that seem to actually get it."
32,"@ThePlagueNFT So glad you’re doing this. I think if I ever need to explain NFT’s to a normie, I’m just sending them to this."

95,"@meetdion @BAYC2745 As a business owner, father, and husband, I microdose to give me “get shit done” focus while working. A macro experience may open you up to experiences that help with the “why” side of our purpose which can help with the pressure."
96,"@MitchHa22307576 @BAYC2745 I recommend finding an sharing circle and integrate your experience with fellow mind travelers. If you can’t find one locally, the San Francisco Psychedelic Society holds one every month via Zoom. Link is on their website."

98,@awpoulos @BAYC2745 There are a few widely accepted protocols. Look into the “Stamets Protocol” or the “Fadiman Protocol”
99,@S3Crypto @BAYC2745 Yes. And much much more. Be careful with that one. Most powerful experience of my life.
