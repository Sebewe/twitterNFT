0,@danielgothits I would rather NFT people just build first and then pitch a real product when it's ready for launch.
1,"@ghostofftm Yea, I am."
2,@The_Kevin_DAO Kevin the movie?
3,@jrcashhh @doodles Wouldn't you have preferred a separate Spaceship drop you could buy/sell without selling both?
4,@condethepeople One of my favorites as a kid.
5,"@MoonOverlord Coins are all about what VC/whale decides to take a big position and pump their own bags. Let's not pretend it's all about quality art  in NFTs. Only a few are legit good (Azuki/doodles), most are average at best (hapes) and just get shilled on Twitter to get them pumped."
6,@SirPantsALot2 @bitcoinkang I wouldn't be surprised if they create a Dao to make the first movie starring KEVIN
7,"Ok, KEVIN has officially gone viral. GG world. https://t.co/VCqexWmoNo"
8,@MoonOverlord The people have spoken.
9,"@LongLiveTheLam @Pixelmon People are still hating on the rise of Kevin, but they will learn the power of meme culture."
10,@riceboy42069 @AzukiZen ⛩️⛩️⛩️🙌🙌🙌
11,"@sleepyavocad0 @SpiritAzuki @AntonymNFT Massive hype, wouldn't be shocked if it is overpriced by a lot"
12,@ryandcrypto Rolex is the original NFTs. Hold and the price goes up if you get the right one.
13,@vinrock_ 3 Kevins
14,@CarolinaMillan 7 friends and family directly. All holding @AzukiZen
15,@latteicecoffee A genius?
16,"Not sure if this is real or not, but it's hilarious. https://t.co/tcdAr9lxtY"
17,@arw0ng @AzukiZen Love to see it. Welcome to the garden ⛩️
18,@burnfiat4jpegs @AzukiZen This is beautiful 🙌🙌🙌⛩️
19,"@0xPyrrhic It's better to be really good or really bad, mediocrity doesn't cut it anymore."
20,Is owning a Kevin going to be the next NFT flex? He's so ugly he's become a must have for collectors https://t.co/MHQJ4X0Pnt
21,@ron1ndoteth @AzukiZen This is definitely a hidden gem. 💯
22,"@SpiritAzuki Won't buy a $50 steak, but will buy an NFT for 10k USD and think it's cheap."
23,@mooneynft @AzukiZen Big brain moves only 🧠⛩️⛩️⛩️
24,@SpiritAzuki Never heard of @AntonymNFT ? Launching this week
25,@nairb621 @AzukiZen 🙏🏼
26,@nairb621 @AzukiZen This one is 🔥🔥🔥💯
27,@_73_X @AzukiZen Happy to see another spirit elemental 1/1 on this thread. 🙏🙏 💯
28,@KatsuCompany @AzukiZen That golden ticket is too 🔥🔥
29,@ape4007 @AzukiZen 🤝💯
30,@babykoton @AzukiZen Welcome to the Azuki garden 🤝
31,These are the 4 hidden 1/1 Azuki double elemental spirits. 2 male and 2 female. Earth/fire/water/lightning https://t.co/MC37Wn4lzv
32,@kartrud_eth @AzukiZen 🤝
33,I heard there is an @AzukiZen spirit club? I acquired this Azuki spirit grail early post launch because he was one of the 4 unique hidden 1/1 double elemental spirits (earth/fire/water/lightning). Are any other hidden 1/1 Azukis out there? Post your pics below. https://t.co/gosw2wSbu2
34,@thejotake @Pixelmon @Syberer Won't argue that...
35,@thejotake @Pixelmon @Syberer Big brain moves 🧠
36,"RT @InsightRh: Alright, finally sitting down to read through this @Pixelmon Litepaper. Gonna lay out some thoughts as I read, hopefully it…"
37,@taipeicity_eth @AzukiZen @metag33 Welcome back to the garden ⛩️⛩️💯
38,@tony_intern Because over 50% of the population has a hard time meeting their monthly expenses. Adding hundreds of dollars to the energy bill every month is devastating if you are poor.
39,@Degentraland @ZAGABOND Wait till Azuki drops their first merch and compare it to the Doodles merch. You'll see how massive Azuki will be in terms of a streetwear brand globally.
40,"@Degentraland You make some good points for doodles, but before writing this thread you should probably disclose how many Doodles you hold. Your small thread on @AzukiZen tells me you don't understand what they are trying to build or their full background."
41,"@DiscoverXnft Probably a bear cycle for the next few months, wouldn't be shocked."
42,@ajiwagmi I've made this mistake over and over. Sometimes it's best just to stay safe on the sidelines and let the carnage settle before making a move.
43,"RT @searchsignal: Putin has declared war. I live in Kharkiv. There are explosions in my city.

44,@4n6_nerd @RiddlerNFT 💯
45,@RiddlerNFT Check the prices of every bluechip NFT project and you will see them all dumping today. That is where the money is coming from.
46,@vinrock_ @AzukiZen That brown theme is dope. Great find💯
47,"@nairb621 When you pay .25E for mint and you can sell for an instant 40x, you are crazy not to."
48,@apollolabsfi I wouldn't be shocked if we headed into a 2-3 month NFT bear market after this. Too many cash grabs and money is just being recycled from one pumped project to the next. Need a proper correction for the market to achieve balance again.
49,"@robbyhammz I remember when Hapes was sitting at 8-9 eth floor pre-reveal forever. But yea, hype sells in this market."
50,@robbyhammz I don't understand the logic in buying an IF for 12.5 eth before reveal.
51,@iamashchild @InvsbleFriends There needs to be a way to short NFTs when they launch.
52,"@danielgothits Every new NFT launch just drains money from other projects. People think it's WAGMI when it comes to NFTs, but they don't realize it is money being recycled from one pumped project to the next. Until Coinbase brings in new money, expect your bags to slowly dump with new releases."
53,"@metag33 @0xBender @AzukiZen When I say Treasury, that includes salaries and hires. All of the money is going towards growing the company. I'm not sure how other projects count team payouts, but judging from the past, this usually means getting rich. @0n1Force founders a good example."
54,@0xBender 75% of the sale went to the team and only 25% went to the Treasury. More teams need to take a page from @AzukiZen and have 100% of the sale go towards building the Treasury. I won't touch projects that pay themselves first.
55,@nftfren The answer depends on whether I hold it or not.
56,@JustBrianEth @AzukiZen The best time to buy is during market downturns. Great find 💯 ⛩️
57,"@HeyStell4r @AzukiZen Nice grab, welcome to the garden ⛩️"
58,Watching the live stream from @AntonymNFT founders and I'm very impressed. I think this is going to be the next @AzukiZen.
59,@rexwub I usually have an internal filter that adds those words into every shill tweet I read. Thanks for saving me the effort.
60,@Zagreus64eth This was a great story. I can relate to your journey from crypto/defi to NFts. Looking forward to reading more of your thoughts in the future.
61,@RosebudRevival Definitely a rock ⭐
62,@Zagreus64eth @AzukiZen That spirit golden boombox hits differently. ⛩️
63,@DESIGNEDBYJBELL Congrats! Very special moment!
64,@MoonOverlord When @mcuban bought $Sushi at $15 and shouted out the team for their hard work... Those were the good ol' defi days...
65,"@agent8michael When sellers are desperate and there is no liquidity, that's the best time to buy high value items. You can get massive discounts during desperate times."
66,"@krissyos @gioperalto I think Doodles looks like its geared towards kids, while Azuki is going to be a dope streetwear brand. Different target markets IMO."
67,@twobitidiot This lecture was a good background on the situation https://t.co/CNAkbitHj6
68,"@DiscoverXnft Yes, probably a good idea to dump under the floor in this scenario."
69,"@DeFi_Brian @AzukiZen I appreciate the team being up front and saying they are in build mode for the next 3-6 months. No false expectations or promises, but you know they are going to hit the next drop out of the park."
70,"@DCAbae @DiscoverXnft Ok, I assumed it was the price people were mad at. If it's design, that's a fair point. I wouldn't buy it, but maybe it's because I don't hold doodles."
71,"@SteveG60117 I think it leaves a lot to be desired, but I'm not a holder so my opinion shouldn't count"
72,@DiscoverXnft I don't know how someone who pays $30-40k for a PFP could complain about spending $150 on a hoody. If it was a virtual hoody they wouldn't blink at a $1000 price tag.
73,"People who are fudding @pixelmon  are the same ones who will be buying after the rest of CT decides to jump in. This project has the funding and leadership to make it a top metaverse game. It's a long term hold 6-12 months minimum, but I think it's worth a bet. https://t.co/iGaCUN2ONh"
74,"@4n6_nerd We need to separate the wheat from the chaff. That being said, I am way happier holding bluechip NFTs then crypto right now"
75,@a1rport_eth There is a snapshot for the $WRLD token coming up for NFT world holders. Everyone is fomo buying before that happens. I suspect price crashes after this event. Could be wrong though.
76,@JamsLikesNFTs @Olivia77582 @AzukiZen Appreciate the community alert. I'm sure some people would fall for this. ⛩️
77,@FI_Spartan Looking forward to @AzukiZen  setting the gold standard when it comes to their first merch drop
78,@sunalNFT @AzukiZen I really hope Azuki drops an exclusive sneaker
79,"@JamsLikesNFTs @AzukiZen Let's start with the first conference in LA, then head to the motherland after."
80,@WillSMONG This is how you survive a bear market ⛩️💯
81,@RoninBlade3333 I'm all for the blue Azuki gang 🥶🥶🥶💯
82,"@notalexlin @AzukiZen Agreed, the Azuki community is second to none."
83,@ape4007 @AzukiZen Blue spirit is 🔥🔥🔥⛩️
84,"@DiscoverXnft People buying $LOOKS at these prices are very brave, especially under these market conditions."
85,"@SajadNFT The concept of play to earn is good in theory, but the moment you play a game to earn money, you are essentially working, and it stops being fun. That's why Axie is dominated by people in third world countries who make a living off of the game. It is how they make a living."
86,@burnfiat4jpegs They already tried this with Apezuki and it's currently worth almost nothing. People who buy these things are crazy.
87,@NFTooPerfect Pretty sure it was a phishing exploit from the most recent reports.
88,"@NFTooPerfect An insurance wouldn't cover a phishing exploit like this. It would be similar to defi insurance, only pay out if platforms are hacked and not user errors."

95,@DonFungible @birthmark_tv @AzukiZen @BernardNakamoto @javitoshi @susuki1220 @0xMakase @anhek_ @NFTdivide @GoshfatherTV @eranthe_eth This is an absurd steal. Easily worth 150-200e for an immediate quick sale. Congrats 👏👏👏
96,@cryptoditegreen @AzukiZen This is a ridiculously low price to sell this Azuki for. I would have bought it if I had seen this for 90. It's worth at least 150-200e minimum
97,@ron1ndoteth I would be happy with Azuki only merch and general merch for everyone. This is a good balance that can make it feel exclusive and accessible to everyone. I hope those red jackets are exclusive.
98,@ron1ndoteth I disagree. We have BOBU merch for the general public and we have Azuki merch for holders. Study any luxury brand and you will see there is a lot of value in limited edition items. There needs to be some core benefits to holding an Azuki besides price going up.
