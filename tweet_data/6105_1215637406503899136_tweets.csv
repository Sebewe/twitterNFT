I had a lot of faith but that game is over. 

@AssetMerge will rise upon this chaos and bring death to the ancient finance tools called ''marketplace''."

- Joined Jan. 2022
- Claims to own #BAYC since recently but is calling himself „broke“
- Literally every post is engagement bait or „please follow me back“

#BAYC #0xApes #Punks https://t.co/smN3peXC7a"
33,@d_masterofnone Basically like uniswap but you can swap between ERC20 (fungible) and ERC721 (non-fungible) tokens.
34,"@d_masterofnone It‘s a NFT AMM, ser. Not a bridge."
35,"@CryptoWeeb30 Thanks, forgot his name😂"

38,"Now, imagine you could add 5 #BAYC + 500Ξ into a liquidity pool and earn fees based on the total collections volume. Wouldn‘t that be great? 

If you sell it for your desired price, you recieve the ETH. 

If no one picks your NFT to buy it, you‘re still earning trading fees."
39,"A little thread🧵 

Imagine a place where NFTs would be 24/7 liquid. 
Imagine Uniswap would allow you to just swap NFTs. 

The inefficiency of NFTs are clear. Your 10 #BAYC which are listed since months are worth ~1‘000Ξ but only once you sell them."

93,"@hungrytrtl @d_masterofnone @0xApes_NFT Our dev has a solution to this. The idea is to offer liquidation-free loans backed by our native token. 

Thus also means no liquidation cascade &amp; especially no liquidation hunters that profit from you being rekt."
94,@hungrytrtl @d_masterofnone @0xApes_NFT One of the great differences between 0xDao and Wonderland will be the use of MIM. Now the issue is they all overleveraged to death and borrowed way more than they could cover -&gt; it collapsed.
95,"@hungrytrtl @d_masterofnone @0xApes_NFT And yes, in exchange for discounted tokens - vested. 

Vesting period is 5 days however we can introduce dynamic vesting period easily if it‘s benefiting the protocol in any way."
96,"@hungrytrtl @d_masterofnone @0xApes_NFT LOOKS &amp; 0xDao LP will be main focus. Stables, Looks/wETH LP can be optionally added if needed.

Also since our treasury allows custom auto-compounding strategies, we could adapt in future and switch up protocols if there‘s anything around that beats LOOKS for example."

98,@0xDegenn 🤝👀
99,"@hungrytrtl @d_masterofnone @0xApes_NFT + the upside would be:

- People pumping LOOKS -&gt; pumping our bags. 

- Pumping LOOKS = more APY = more rewards.

- More bond = more treasury value = more revenue = more buyback pressure."
