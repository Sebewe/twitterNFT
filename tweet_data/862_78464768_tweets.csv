2,@Zeneca_33 Tumi is nice. Very practical and good quality.
3,@yuppitsyosaf @doodles Wow! Your piloting skills are 💯
4,@ohDotss Hello sent you a DM.
5,@steve7885 @Diamond_Cruiser @nanoverseHQ @nftislove Im close to blocking you
6,"@meta_altz Yes! I’ve personally made a lot already (w/o even selling one) from getting free NFTs to getting dozens of WL spots. 

Been holding since Day 1 and haven’t sold a single one"
7,"@Diamond_Cruiser @nanoverseHQ I listened first to the podcast before posting 😉

If Im gonna hold something long term, I wanna wear my analyst hat and not my degen hat 🙂"
8,"Tagging some friends so they can take a look 🙂
@eden_holdings @MrJamesonNeat @Zeneca_33  @htdot3 @oneinaneillion @jbondwagon"
9,Listen to this podcast. You'll know that nanopass founder @reicannon is someone who knows what he is doing. He is certainly not just vibin and goofing around.
10,"You need a TEAM. 

And that's why I'm so bullish with @nanoverseHQ. They have like 15 core team members across different industries. Devs, artists, streamers &amp; gamers, designer, businessman, analyst, marketing specialist, lawyers, CPA, and so on."
11,"And the expectations are high once you do raise those amount of funds. 

I'm also not that bullish on projects that are too much reliant on one person, whether it's the artist, the dev or the founder. Again, an NFT project is like a business, you need a competent team to run it."
12,"Nothing against very young founders. Some of them are still in high school, it's cool and all but they still lack relevant life, business &amp; managerial experience. Passion for a project alone won't be enough. Raising several million USD is a lot of responsibility."
13,"Running an NFT project is like running a business and a brand...it's not just about passion, art, vibe, and so on. 

Execution is super important and it helps a lot if you have experience.

14,"@FFVV1211 Yeah it's nice...it was also similar to mid 2000s when Facebook started to gain popularity. Ppl kept saying social media is a fad. Same was said to Twitter, Youtube, IG and so on."
15,"@FFVV1211 Internet is a fad, according to a Dec 2000 article 🙂 https://t.co/Rk1kJvlz1G"

21,@MrJamesonNeat @TheStarslabNFT I got one. Just want to try it out 🙂
22,@MrJamesonNeat Check out this one @TheStarslabNFT it’s quite interesting. It has a “holocube” which can project your NFT in a hologram.

31,"@wmcabangon Those 9/10 are either not updated or just really out of touch….

Auto Stops &amp; trigger orders are a norm anywhere else outside the Philippines."
32,@steve7885 Some comes back like what Pixelmon founders did. They did blue chip shopping after raising funds
33,"@jrcashhh @doodles The market is just weak right now…BAYC did drop quite a lot after MAYC then it eventually recovered. 

Doodles not dropping in a weak market is already bullish"
34,@jbondwagon Check out the stats of Space Doods….it’s def a hint that there will be more phases 😉 animation is just the start
35,"@OttoSuwenNFT @Loopifyyy Market needs to rest. It’s clearly exhausted from all those high mint high supply projects. Jan-Feb euphoria level is not sustainable. 

We had record number of market participants but also record number of new projects."
36,"Market is exhausted from high mint projects.

Founders, you better start adjusting your mint price since market won't take your high mint price anymore. 

Been seeing a lot of flops recently. Mainly because mint prices are expensive."
37,"@MrJamesonNeat @Sir_Apesalot @doodles Doodles don't disappoint. Under promise, over deliver!"

In NFTs, you buy something, got wrecked, but it's a funny Kevin derivative, you'll just laugh and treasure it forever 🤣

43,@Sir_Apesalot @itsdanataylor @MrJamesonNeat and we're the most tight rare group out there.
44,@MorisNFTs @SatoshiRunnerz ikr!!! really don't like rushed WL minting especially if it's just conducive for western time zones. there are also Asian minters!
45,@itsdanataylor Hey also consider Rainbow head and join our exclusive group. Right @MrJamesonNeat? 🙂

47,"@zakareth 
@0xFocus"
48,"Was looking forward to minting @SatoshiRunnerz but was shocked it sold out when I was about to mint presale.

I can understand the decision to overallocate WL spots but pls be considerate of time zones. We can't mint and read your announcements during mint when we're asleep."
49,@rig444 Yessir!!
50,"Woke up early, meditated, did some light workout. Shadow box, ropes and heavy bag work.

Now drinking coffee and checking discord. I feel so good.

Which among these is a good buy in case the market dips and why? @coolcatsnft @CyberKongz or @InvsbleFriends? 

I don't hold any right now, and pls don't tell me to just buy all 3.

71,@DiscoverXnft @0xDomex You should replace Hape with Hypebears. Hypebears minted at 0.40 and could go toe to toe with Pixelmon reveal
72,@htdot3 They even closed gen chat during minting because of “too many fudders” 🤷🏻‍♂️
73,"“Stay away from FUD, delist and be a diamond holder”

I just saw this announcement from a newly launched project. IMO stay away if you see founders saying this...

This doesn't foster a healthy community. A healthy community doesn't sell shame."

77,"@eden_holdings @nanoverseHQ They’re more than just land…and numbers wise, it’s more than 70% distribution ratio..bulk of holders are long, less than 5% listed, slow but steady ascent (no crazy volatility or pump).

81,"@steve7885 @bennysjockstrap @WonderPals I stand corrected. You’re not WL in HAPE, you bought on secondary at 4 ETH. 

Just buy secondary @WonderPals if you really want it. Give chance to those with less ETH."
82,"@steve7885 @bennysjockstrap @WonderPals Wonderpals is not aimed for those who can spend a lot of ETH on 4 slimhoods. 

They’re aiming it to be a fair launch and give access to majority of NFT players."
83,"This is Squiggles revealed art. Public DA started and sold out at 1ETH....original planned WL mint was 0.40 (before the ""FUD"" attack according to fanatics).

High mint price was supposed to justify art, roadmap &amp; utility.
