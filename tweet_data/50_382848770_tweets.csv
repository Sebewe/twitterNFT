1,@neweratrades @andy8052 Yes. That's the phishing aspect. But perhaps a design flaw if one sig can allow the exploiter to (1) inject arbitrary code after acquiring the sig and (2) that code allows them to take any approved asset.
2,"@andy8052 Phishing or not, their contract allows injection of a malicious contract that can yoink all your approved assets in one shot. Expected behavior?"
3,@dfinzer Can’t you guys stop it by cutting off the old contract now?

6,"@0xfoobar Just looking at some more examples... private sale buyers are usually in position addrs[1], while the NFT contract is in position [4]... what's going on?"
7,Is there an @WyvernProtocol  expert that can break this down for us?
8,"@0xfoobar Looking at calldata, these appear to be signed private sales. Probably collected over time Note that addrs[4] is the exploiter's wallet. @0xfoobar do you agree? https://t.co/1cxZAIh8iO"

30,@VonMises14 Show us where Larva even *attempted* to formally revoke the license from these tokens. Then we can get some smart people to debate whether it's valid.

41,@CardilloSamuel @andy8052 More than just a drama tweet. It was tweet by the most holder unfriendly IP policy in NFT space telling people to rip off the foundational NFT project's IP.
42,@CardilloSamuel Is this official approval that we can all start selling XenolC NFTs?

75,"@bertcmiller Last one: Punk floor is less than the price of selling a $PUNK token into a DEX. Bot buys punk, tokenizes it into $PUNK ERC20, sells on a DEX and collects the spread. 3/3"
76,"@bertcmiller Seller lowers asking price and buyer comes in at the same time without seeing the new price on the UI (or it’s in mempool). Bot buys at new lower price and sells to the buyer at the higher price, collecting a spread.  2/3"

85,@eth_ben @pirate_cheetah 20% roughly. Today ended up being pretty good but only because the price mooned while the website was down and you couldn't claim!
