3,"@joelle_lb For a while during the pandemic, a lot of the high traffic parks in the west (Yosemite, Zion, Rocky Mtn) were requiring permits / reservations... It is crazy. People came out of the woodwork.

Acadia in Maine was also insane because its the only NP option for New Englanders"
4,"@649Speedy disheartening to see such a clean crown on the E2 floor. Think that is more telling than the other numbers...

Previous E2s on the floor were whack looking... to see my brother just sitting there is crazy.

devs doooo something"

8,@Bonecondor Sounds like the perfect plot for the summer’s blockbuster film! Pierce Brosnan as James Bond in: The World Is… Still… Not Enough
9,@Helloimmorgan @Pixelmon Wait and you think you are any better/different than them? You do what they do on a much smaller scale.
10,@cobie @samKen I can’t go to Ukraine because I’m already fucking ded after reading this.

25,@TheWormNFT @andrwwang I knew y’all seemed smart when I met you in NYC.
26,@0x_Hammer gas usage vs trading vol? Still seems odd
27,"@cozyy_eth @WeatheReportNFT A legal document vs. hearsay and conjecture, which will prevail?"

29,@natenm99 @WeatheReportNFT lol
30,"@DatBoiTreach @Dentinmyhead @WeatheReportNFT maybe some leniency with the sentencing, but certainly not the verdict"
31,@0xinc @nftfren API endpoint attack. Think your tweet from this am sums it up. Sad. Hopefully milk back up in next few days
32,"@dexworker @andrwwang This is the most damning piece I'm seeing, and don't feel the spaces is addressing it. Feel bad for the founders cause it sounds like they are in over their head and trying to use emotions as their defense."
33,@MattFeinbergEsq @andrwwang It's absolutely critical and I think these guys could be in for a lot of trouble even if they mint out and make tons of money from it. Just getting tied up in defending themselves will be super costly and distracting.
34,"@andrwwang I think its a lack of clarity around who owns the 'art' w/o a legal contract dictating the terms. 

Yes, WR went to the artist with the idea... but it was the artist who created the initial works that formed the basis of the project. 

Who is right? IDK"

39,@Helloimmorgan Yeah I think nurses need to have empathy and you lack that. Bearish.
40,"@Helloimmorgan Except this isn't the first time... e.g. you shilled bubblesUtonium's 2nd ""project"" that was an immediate rug. Just bc you didn't benefit from it in time doesn't mean people don't remember."

47,@AtownBrown @MTLFORBRKFST @mthigh Sounds like we need a @coolcatsnft Big Bear ski day soon
48,@MTLFORBRKFST @AtownBrown I’m usually on skis so more like this https://t.co/5P0sQNwmac
49,"@MTLFORBRKFST @AtownBrown No shame in starting on the bunny hill. More reps. plus, you don’t want to struggle getting on/off a high speed quad 😂"
50,"@MTLFORBRKFST @AtownBrown A bit different. Prepare to spend your first day on your ass. don’t be afraid to snag a half day lesson, will definitely speed up your progression"
51,@Drkyronious @andrwwang there's no skiing in vail atm either. just i-70 traffic and lift lines.
52,"@Neuprojects @PlayGOALS Call it 1 in 3 and 3 in 1, with bad math we can call it 1 per game 😂"
53,@bigdsenpai Go hiking in Boulder on a Saturday and tell me it’s underrated
54,@PlayGOALS How often are long shot goals scored in FIFA vs how often are long shot goals scored in real life. Find somewhere in between 😂

68,@BakedApeETH I think the next utility / burn mechanism for $MILK will be announced well before all pets are hatched. Especially since pets can still quest so the inflation rate will continually increase as more pets are hatched.
69,@cryptojames_v @coolcatsnft @lilfrecklez @_chrisperalta #6264!
70,"@kriptokat_ @Bonecondor @blknoiz06 I think the pain stems from the feeling that I’d rather have my funds stolen by a James Bond villain, an underground criminal syndicate, or something like the Lazarus group as opposed to someone who’d make me Irish Exit a boozy brunch because they make my ears bleed."
71,"@Bonecondor @blknoiz06 oh well, see you on 8kun"
72,"@Bonecondor @blknoiz06 This is the first time I’ve believed anything is actually could be a psyop and it’s making me wonder if it’s time to just Q-pill myself and get it over with.

81,"@tonhwk hmm, haven't heard anything specific about quest rarity chances... thought it was more along the lines of future in-game benefits... that would be sweet though @evanluza 👀"
82,"@tonhwk Ehh, right now everyone is focused on pets hatching &amp; milk economics. Think the real high-tier catalyst will come when the tier specific utility is revealed (more than just ~40% more $MILK)"
83,@BrantlyMillegan @metaversehodl Ha you think this is a joke
