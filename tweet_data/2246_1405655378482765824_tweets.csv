2,@ApezEth @___chawk @itsmynamejef Should Clone X really be 2x the mcap of Doodles this early? This really just proved my point that short term Doodles is the safer play buying around this support level.
3,"@___chawk @itsmynamejef This is just a short term outlook, thinking 2-3 months from now. Long term I would say both are safe bets. Toss up for me."
4,"@___chawk @itsmynamejef Oct launch vs Dec launch. I just think that plays a big role in diamond handed holders. Clone X may see more volume, but I think Doodles is sailing smoother waters for now."
5,@itsmynamejef Doodles is the safer play IMO. Might find some deals over the next day or two from the Space Doodles volatility.

44,@DolliesNFT @DiscoverXnft Azuki is already higher than VF though and it's been like 2 weeks lol
45,@DiscoverXnft Because of supply and momentum I would say Doodles beats CloneX by a small margin. Azuki is just too fresh IMO. They will get there though.
