23,"This feels like a very ""I'm not mad, just disappointed"" moment for Top Shot. 

Always way worse."
24,"@WwWishing @KDTrey5 @EvaluateMarket @cryptoslamio I think it depends on what your goals are, but think it's a safe bet that s1, based on how other collectible markets work, has the best chance of retaining/gaining value. 

But ecosystem is expanding fast and getting more complex w/ utility, so lots of avenues to pursue."
25,"@WwWishing @KDTrey5 @EvaluateMarket @cryptoslamio Also, small sample size but def been a drop-off after season during first 2 years as NBA interest wanes over summer."
26,"@WwWishing @EvaluateMarket @cryptoslamio Can only speak for myself, but of the close to a dozen people I on-boarded, I can only think of one who is still engaged in platform."
27,@WwWishing @EvaluateMarket @cryptoslamio We also can't live under the presumption that most people who were in on the craziness last year actually *stayed* with the platform. Many could have moved on.
28,"@WwWishing @EvaluateMarket @cryptoslamio Can't speak to reporting 100%, but there was a ton more frenetic buying/selling last year during peak. S1 price fell for months while TS added utility to other sets, not s1. 

TS Debuts now being used in challenges on reg, likely contributing to recent rise."
29,@WwWishing @KDTrey5 @EvaluateMarket @cryptoslamio My guess is they started using Top Shot debuts regularly in flash challenges
30,"@corporatetrash1 So valuable. Best thing that happened to my career as well. I often think how many folks would benefit from elements of the process of recovery. Of course, to your point, it's generally not something people do unless they're truly up against it."
31,"@corporatetrash1 As an alcoholic in recovery, I'd respectfully disagree. I couldn't do that, but needed to learn in order to live. I got there, but I needed a lot of help. Best thing that ever happened to me, but wouldn't have been able to do it alone."
