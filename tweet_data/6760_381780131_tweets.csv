If you are one of those struggling with their mental health, reach out for support from a friend or loved one. If you feel like you have no one, I invite you to reach out to me.  You are not alone.

And if you are one of the toxic diseases…it’s never to late to choose light."
9,"3/4
We all have a choice...we can choose to be a positive light or we can choose to be a toxic disease. If you are one of the positive lights…speak your light, share your light! Check in on your loved ones, tell them how much you value and appreciate them."

Greed and entitlement are running rampant and it seems to have been  forgotten by some that there are real humans behind the pseudonyms, mods, devs, creators, etc."
11,"Heavy heavy heart today.

One of my favorite things about the NFT community when I jumped in a year ago was how positive the space was…still is, but there are definitely characters with a mission to extinguish the light and spread hate.

It’s one of the deepest gut feelings I’ve ever had…from when I first learned of @BoredApeYC on May 11, 2021 I knew this project was something special.
