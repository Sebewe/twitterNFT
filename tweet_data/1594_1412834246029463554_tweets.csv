20,what are we gonna do when nfts arent worth enough to be a core part of our personalities anymore
21,"@WhiteWhiskers0 @Emphemba08 @AardvarkAmos @DeaconGrantly @Not_onMy_Watch Oh no, im well aware of what you twitter warriors believe, it just would be completely irrelevant in a court of law."
22,@WhiteWhiskers0 @Emphemba08 @AardvarkAmos @DeaconGrantly @Not_onMy_Watch I wasnt aware of the Proud Boys having any sort of official recognition as a White Supremacist movement. Nor do I believe the ok sign has any such designation either. So seems like this would be an irrelevant factor.
23,@WalkingLogout @AardvarkAmos @DeaconGrantly @Not_onMy_Watch That's crazy how he was found not guilty for that exact thing then.
24,@Emphemba08 @AardvarkAmos @DeaconGrantly @Not_onMy_Watch Im sure you were also saying that he would get convicted of murder so your ideas of what will happen in a court room can be disregarded.
25,@WalkingLogout @AardvarkAmos @DeaconGrantly @Not_onMy_Watch lmfao. whataboutism.
26,"@Emphemba08 @AardvarkAmos @DeaconGrantly @Not_onMy_Watch Calling someone a white supremacist is certainly defamation. How can one ""morally"" be a white supremacist? What an idiotic statement."
27,@AardvarkAmos @DeaconGrantly @Not_onMy_Watch Maybe watch the clip? Having the entire mainstream media label you as a murderer and a white supremacist when you arent one is an injustice.

45,@zachxbt @Helloimmorgan The whole team and @OnChainTV (Morgan is a part of it) is in that thread gaslighting and defending her. Would be good to keep and eye out on them for shady practices as well. @DaBunnyOFFICIAL
46,@illaDaProducer @fauxcondor @smokethatdank1 @Helloimmorgan @JackedApeClub Oh look another friend of dabunny and Morgan making weak excuses for her. You guys are all over this thread showing why your group of friends shouldn’t be trusted if you all think like this.
47,@nf_qts @Helloimmorgan Here’s some more proof of this being a consistent behavior pattern though just in case that wasn’t enough. https://t.co/tkvSE7aDsf
48,@nf_qts @Helloimmorgan Lol. Ask for proof that she denied it was paid. Post proof. Move goalpost.  Bye bye.
49,@nf_qts @Helloimmorgan the screenshot is literally directly under the post https://t.co/W0iI9gaVOJ
50,@nf_qts @Helloimmorgan then why did she lie about being paid when asked about it if it was just her overlooking disclosing being paid due to being new to paid promos. Wouldnt the fact that she lied about it imply that she knew it was wrong?
51,@CarrollQuigley1 yeah so glad that this happened so that influencers will learn that... *checks notes*..they shouldnt lie to their followers about being paid for promotion. Get real.

54,"@nf_qts @Helloimmorgan When reputation is what gets you paid (as seen here), paying back and earning that goodwill pays dividends over leaving your followers out to dry. Every move shes made here favors her. If she cared about her followers she wouldnt have done an undisclosed shill in the first place."
55,"@nf_qts @Helloimmorgan How is it respectable to say ""yo, I fucked up"" when you've been outright caught in a lie and its your only option. What else was she gonna do, delete her twitter and lose her income?"
56,@DamonHipAss @DaBunnyOFFICIAL @cheftommygun @Helloimmorgan How can you DYOR when the parties feeding you information are working asymmetric knowledge and not disclosing their paid shills
57,@JasonBajada @cal_ej @Helloimmorgan rule #2 of crypto/nfts : dont scam your followers by not disclosing paid shills.
58,@nf_qts @Helloimmorgan lol bro ur giving way too much benefit of the doubt where it isnt deserved. there is nothing new about having to disclose paid promos even in crypto.
59,@Helloimmorgan Sorry but you lied to people saying that you were not paid which means you knew what you were doing when you didn't disclose it. Wasn't like you made an honest mistake.

66,"@Lynqoid @casualhindu @cloncast @jasvault I see in the new announcement it is made more clear. The bot part wasnt the confusing part it was the ""putting into the hands of collectors, not bots"" that made it sound like it was about bots taking the mint. since a DDOS bot wouldnt put the cool pets in the hands of a bot."
67,"@casualhindu @cloncast @jasvault The announcement was clearly made to sound like it would be bots taking the mint, and not another technical issue."
68,"@casualhindu @cloncast @jasvault The wording on the announcement was ""The dev team is combatting a heavy bot attack. We’ll be delaying the public mint until we’re confident we can get Cool Pets into the hands of collectors, and not bots."" How can that be taken any other way than bots taking the mint?"
69,"@cloncast @jasvault Can you explain how ""The dev team is combatting a heavy bot attack. We’ll be delaying the public mint until we’re confident we can get Cool Pets into the hands of collectors, and not bots."" could mean anything other than botters taking mint?"
70,@cloncast @jasvault seems like it was intentionally made to seem like it was about bots taking the mint so that it wasnt seen as another technical issue after so many already... how is a DDOS attack not mitigatable after knowing so far in advance that it could be an issue?
