9,@TommyAvalanche @flipcitynft @JPGJEFF @CryptoDeeby @PuffyPawsPack Want me to use my magic wand and create a game out of thin air? I think it was very obvious that the funds from mint were going towards development to create a game dude lol
10,@TommyAvalanche @flipcitynft @JPGJEFF @CryptoDeeby @PuffyPawsPack A lawsuit for what lol? I haven’t done anything close to illegal lmao
11,@danielgothits Lol this looks so fun
12,"@TommyAvalanche @SweetBabyNicco @PuffyPawsPack No clue what my age has to do with this, doesn’t matter

I don’t have time to look over every small thing Ive tasked someone with to make sure they are doing it right, you have to trust the people you hired 

We will learn from the mistake and make sure it doesn’t happen again"
13,"@TommyAvalanche @SweetBabyNicco @PuffyPawsPack Tbf it was clearly stated in the discord that you are to DYOR before buying in

I never vetted this project and never trusted it, I’m not the one handling WLs

New rules have been put in place now and I’ll be vetting every project we provide WLs for now"

21,@Barthazian @vasa_develop Yea vasa send me a message let’s talk 🤝
22,"On behalf of NFT twitter, I sincerely apologize to anyone named Kevin

No one will ever be able to look at you the same again"
23,@PopeyesNFTs I’m throwing up a fat giveaway when I wake up I won’t lose this one 😂
24,@PopeyesNFTs The race is on 🏇
25,"98.2% of the way to 100k, almost there 📈❤️"
26,"@JTNTTX I like it

We already have the dao set up which makes this work out great, we can just keep on throwing profits back into the dao and buying blue chips like we were, which means technically all holders will keep on profiting if they keep on holding"
27,Ok actually I might set this up tomorrow with very limited ETH
28,"Maybe this is a reach, but if some whale is seeing this, likes this idea and would like to assist, send me a DM https://t.co/IsEN6jXrfU"
29,"@OttoSuwenNFT Me: mom can we have @AmeerHussainn 
Mom: we have @AmeerHussainn at home

30,"@TheNFTJett @dwpoker Too risky to set up something instant, can easily be exploited and abused if someone finds out how things work 

Def has to all be manual"
31,@lxrdnft Nah just liquidating my own personal NFTs so I can set up something
32,"@dwpoker Yep, which is why I think it’s important that a team is given a few days response to team to thoroughly look through the collection and make a fair offer based on how liquid the collection is, def takes time"
33,"@dwpoker If the user has a lot of illiquid jpegs they would receive a lot lower offer to compensate, but for that example if we assume that 250-275ish e of it is extremely liquid, I think it’s super fair"
34,"@lxrdnft Don’t have enough ETH yet, actually liquidating rn to start setting up"
35,"Like y’all for example, if I had 300e in NFTs that are somewhat liquid but somewhat illiquid, I think I’d gladly take 200ish e for it, and lots of profit to be made for the buyer"
36,"Once I get a good amount of ETH I think I might set up something like this under head DAO, pretty sure I know exactly how to set it up so it’s profitable no matter what"
37,"I truly think some sort of NFT liquidation service would be huge

You could submit a link to your opensea profile, and receive an ETH offer back within days to buy out all your NFTs

Would be great for the user, and insanely profitable for the person providing the service"
38,@champtgram Lmao no way
39,"At this point, It’s mandatory for every NFT project that releases in the future to have a kevin trait

I think we finally have our first true meme nft"
40,"@DannyCrypt Honestly tho literally every time I sweep it ends up being near the top and it’s annoying af

46,"If you see some insane giveaway ran by a person you’ve never seen in the NFT space before, it’s like guaranteed to be fake

I promise you that 21 year old crypto investor john is not giving away 10e if you like and retweet, sorry"

72,"@Crypt0Emma @opensea @MetaMask I had the same issue, 
But it was resolved immediately after i wrote to meta mask Support using this form.
I think you should write to them too."

Will stop worrying about saving hype and release news as I get it"
84,"@NickHasNoETH Honestly there’s been too much negativity around the project especially in the last few days, I’ve noticed it.

I think it could be a result of me not being engaging enough on my own Twitter account with the head DAO community so I’m trying to fix that now"
85,AMA tmrw at 3 pm cst btw
86,"Only 1.04% of Head DAOs listed after todays delisting, will be interesting to see where that number is next week

Will work on getting WL marketplace out by the end of the week and hopefully announce a few other things sometime next week🙏"
87,"@iHypeNFT @SaiyoraJK @paperhandmaxi @HeadDaoNFT Appreciate u! Great buying time with the delisting today as well, floor is even thinner than it was before 😍"
88,"@iHypeNFT @SaiyoraJK @paperhandmaxi @HeadDaoNFT I get these scammer accusations a lot recently but just wish someone could tell me why lmao, literally haven’t done anything wrong"
89,"RT @HeadDaoNFT: HEADDAO FAM! 🧠 🚨 

Tomorrow, we will be hosting our next AMA with @TheShamdoo at around 3:00 PM CST. We will be discussing…"

95,@DiscoverXnft Thread guy knows best
96,"If I wanted to have a hyped stealth drop and still launch it - I’d probs market it, tell people we are looking to launch at a certain time, and then stealth drop days before that time

Very mean, but ensures that most buyers are actual people that are interested in the product"
97,Nah but fr I’m just too lazy LOL
98,@moorellamaa I actually never bought any sneakers with a bot haha
99,"Now that Opensea has delisted whatever NFTs I did have listed… I won’t be relisting any of them.

Too bullish 🐂📈"
