51,@injur3dwalrus @visualsbypierre @nevermindwill @WeatheReportNFT That's the complete opposite of what happened. We agreed on terms and he switched up once it started blowing up. We own our brand and concept and are not using any of his art. Our entire team is built of professionals and career creatives. We don't copy and we don't steal. Facts&gt; https://t.co/y6dgtpAfej

59,@oToasTa @WeatheReportNFT The truth will always prevail no matter how long it takes.
60,@ICanPlug @cyber_messi @oToasTa @WeatheReportNFT This was never going to be our final art it was a rough mock-up/layout of the conceived expression we had predating Dentin's arrival. The entirety of your PFP is my creative direction and character design. Glad you like it. https://t.co/OUaLqsby5J
61,@ICanPlug @mynameisaris @HorologistNFT @MACROD0SING @WeatheReportNFT @Dentinmyhead You're missing the whole narrative here. We had verbally agreed on equity compensation. It was never our brand intention to work with a sole artist. Dentin was hired to get our vision on paper. He reneged on our agreement. Claimed he conceived our vision &amp; copied our whole brand.
62,"@NftMorph @WeatheReportNFT I'm not an illustrator. I'm a graphic designer, photographer, &amp; videographer. I am also the founder and my time is best spent managing the company; art included. As a brand, it was always our mission to have a team of illustrators and designers, not just one."
63,@VanisterNFT @WeatheReportNFT If you were hired as an architect by an architectural agency or company to design the buildings they had already conceived that is still the agency's IP. This is no different.
