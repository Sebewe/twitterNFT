18,"@okbuddynft Nothing super quick and easy to articulate yet. But generally the concept of true, verifiable digital ownership and the concept of digital property rights gets most people who value freedom and decentralization on board quickly."

21,Explaining specific NFT projects to people with no knowledge of the space or crypto in general is a wild ride LOL. Slowly but surely I am getting better at it. The goal is to red pill enough people until the snowball is too big to stop. #web3

53,@TwitterBlue I purchased Twitter blue this morning but every time I press “connect wallet” I’m prompted to purchase Twitter blue again. When I press buy again my phone says “already purchased” what gives?
54,@DCAbae Yeah I am. If I press purchase again my phone gives me a pop up saying “already purchased” so it knows I have it. Weird.
55,@DCAbae When I press the connect wallet button it just prompts me to buy Twitter blue even though I already purchased it. I think it’s a bug.
56,Anyone else got the message Twitter is doing verified NFT’s for profile pics but can’t get it to work? We just bought Twitter Blue and can’t figure it out.
