2,"Still unrecognized in my BAYC hoodie but today at the market a woman working there saw my CKY shirt and said her son was a huge fan ""back in the day"" so I said her son must be a real badass and we shared a smile"
3,@DCLBlogger It’s built @tokenproof
4,@BobbyBellhop Not too much heat so this stuff can be used liberally - gimme a whole plate of wings drenched in this. Nice bit of sweetness but balanced. Would love this in a hab or scotch bonnet version that really brings on the sweats! Solid original sauce no label-slapping here
5,Aight @BobbyBellhop let’s see what you got https://t.co/Iwe6kxQZCA
6,If you’re buying a Kevin for 3eth “for the culture” but you don’t own a yeti for 0.11 you’re doing it wrong
7,@Willuminati_FC I mean adding Kevin as an unlockable fighter would be pretty amazing - I could see him having some Kirby ssb mechanics 😂
8,"@eyeywywyqyqy @oneless @26th_Dimension @PuffYatty @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT @Dentinmyhead You yourself said the 2 most important points:
1. The art is “the most important part of the project”
2. WR became thieves of the art when they chose not to work with Dentin And hired another artist to copy his aesthetic 

Again just a messy situation all over"
9,@heckman_eth One has the potential to send the gang to mars
10,@eyeywywyqyqy @oneless @26th_Dimension @PuffYatty @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT @Dentinmyhead After he created the core parameters of the style and characters as evidenced in his account of the timeline. They’re riffing on what he established. I don’t expect to change your mind as you’re clearly on the side of WR and that’s fine; the market will decide
11,"@oneless @eyeywywyqyqy @26th_Dimension @PuffYatty @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT @Dentinmyhead That’s why the extent of the license must be clearly contracted, or the understanding again in writing that this is an exclusive agreement with full commercial rights to the client, which in this case is what WR should have done"
12,@oneless @eyeywywyqyqy @26th_Dimension @PuffYatty @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT @Dentinmyhead Everything would have been solved - for better or worse - by a proper contract up front. Both sides are to blame for not properly protecting their interests
13,"@eyeywywyqyqy @26th_Dimension @PuffYatty @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT @Dentinmyhead I listened to both spaces, read the write ups from both sides. It’s messy but I choose to support Dentin, as do many others by the numbers on OS. Clearly his execution of an emotion-based project is superior, as cool as the WR booty shades are"
14,"@KingBlackBored @DentedFeelsNFT But ser weather report has booty shades - BOOTY SHADES SER

15,People really out here paying &gt;3eth for a Kevin pixelmon just for the memes?
16,@eyeywywyqyqy @26th_Dimension @PuffYatty @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT @Dentinmyhead His fault for not fully researching what a successful NFT project can yield financially and quoting accordingly; their fault for lowballing him and following it up with a strong arm ultimatum then proceeding to trash his name when he took his work and left
17,@26th_Dimension @PuffYatty @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT @Dentinmyhead brought on to develop the style/art as a partner;  nothing signed but after doing work team offered him 5% with others getting 25%; said if he didn’t take it they’d find another artist to copy him (they did); dentin says🖕and releases the art himself @DentedFeelsNFT
18,@inkscribr @DentedFeelsNFT You know how I heard this as I read it 🤣 https://t.co/Xib80jxiuA

20,"@DentedFeelsNFT is currently almost  2.5x mint of 0.11 at 0.26

@WeatheReportNFT is currently below their mint price of 0.15 at 0.126 with 57 sales before getting back to mint 

Art wins"
21,"This @DentedFeelsNFT strikes me as one that could speak for the collection as a whole - the blank canvas face sitting within the idyllic Spring surroundings. Nobody knows what someone is feeling even when surrounded by what appears as perfection

31,@Willuminati_FC @PuffYatty @FightLegendsNFT *knowing a successful p2e fighter will yield 10x that total mint over its lifetime

34,"“And for the weather let’s go to Flip Ruggs…Flip?”

“Thank you Chad you absolute mfer - we’ve got a storm brewing out of the west; it appears that there’s a swell of support for artistic integrity, and @DentedFeelsNFT has flipped @WeatheReportNFT. Details at fuck it I’m in”"
35,I call telling a bunch of corpo minded rich boys to fuck off after they offer you crumbs for having built their visual brand identity and using that work to release your own project in days just to beat them to mint/reveal and thereby “owning” the art pretty fucking punk rock
36,"@Nate_Rivers @duckie3351 @DentedFeelsNFT @WeatheReportNFT More like he neglectfully agreed to a fair cut up front and when things were coming to fulfillment they threw an insulting 5% at him. Inexperience, perhaps. But WR paying someone else to copy the work he developed rather than work fairly with him just sinks them as a brand. Ngmi"
37,"@bore_d_ape @DentedFeelsNFT @WeatheReportNFT @Dentinmyhead It’s been an interesting one to watch that’s for sure - spaces really helped add more color, ultimately benefitting Dentin’s side imo. I hope the WR spaces “the truth” is still up as I’d advise listening to both. Obv 5% - which the WR pdf confirms - is garbage and an insult"
38,@bore_d_ape @DentedFeelsNFT @WeatheReportNFT Follow the artist @Dentinmyhead for more clarity - there are recorded spaces on both sides with their stories but the WR team refused to bring on Dentin and have an open convo and said some very demeaning things in regards to artist value and contribution to a project
39,@bore_d_ape The artist of @DentedFeelsNFT was brought on by the @WeatheReportNFT team. He developed the trademark floating head style. He was promised a percentage but was kicked off the project with nothing. Used the art he created for his own project. More nuance but that’s the gist
40,@adamsmoot $GANG
41,@bore_d_ape Do you know the story behind these? Because it pretty much clears up which project is legit and which is blatant artist  abuse and theft

49,"@logansgrave They’ve got dragonball, Spider-Man, pikachu traits - I’m guessing it was one of those that caused it"
50,"Lots of assumptions and misinfo on the mories takedown - we don’t know it was cool cats who issues the dmca, also mention of an artist who claims the skull with heart eyes or other trait as their logo. The team will reveal more as appropriate I’m sure"

58,@0xHustler I can't imagine having to leave my wife and daughter not knowing if I'd ever see them again - heartbreaking is right
59,"@KingloBen @heyyovico @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT @Dentinmyhead explained the rush - it was to protect his art, to not be ""second"" behind weather report and have any sort of misunderstanding of where the art originally came from.

98,"@smundonft @0x650d That would have been negotiated long before the auction started in the form of a minimum guarantee, which sothebys would have then insured themselves against by selling that guarantee to a third party. That’s why I asked if the guarantee was acceptable. Something else is up"
99,"@0x650d There's gotta be more to this than ""meh, decided to hodl."" Was there a guarantee in place? If so, was it agreeable to you? You don't get to the minute of auction and pull out, otherwise this is a comically huge dick move for attention bordering on Andy Kaufman levels"
