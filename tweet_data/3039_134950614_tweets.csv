6,I've held my punk for one year today. Happy to say #2363 has never been offered for sale. No doubt this has been among the most transformative years of my life and being part of the Cryptopunks community has been a big part.

52,NFTs definitely stronger than the last dip 25%+ dip. So we've shown some level of cryptonativety when ETH is sideways and down. The question is if NFTs can sustain when ETH goes up... https://t.co/q2IjL9R8LU

61,"Far from an OG (in the space a year this month), but I feel like I'm slowly losing touch with the NFT community. I just hold what I like and don't really mint/buy anything new. I still follow along, but the projects are all so cash grabby - anyone else feel this way?"
