20,@Lunarityyy @FogoNFT @degenables @sabet @CryptoMories I’m only knowledgeable when my bags are under fire.
21,@Lunarityyy @FogoNFT @degenables @sabet @CryptoMories It’s one trait and a bunch of clothing logos. Driving the whole pfp is the part he fucked up. Nobody gives a shit about the logo. The community has always driven the project.
22,@Lunarityyy @FogoNFT @degenables @sabet @CryptoMories Relist *
23,@Lunarityyy @FogoNFT @degenables @sabet @CryptoMories The logo eyes basically the ❌❤️ on the skull was under copyright but he filed a trademark for it 2 weeks ago and then sent the DMAC. Sabet has since retracted the DMCA. Now all the Mories need is to get Opensea attention to delist the collection.

38,@sabet Don’t you have enough fucking money you scum
39,@OzTheApe Exactly! I got tired of all the spaces about it. Pretty sure someone DCMA’d the other but both are listed so maybe I’m wrong.
40,Mories get DCMA yet we have two of of the same project pumping. Make it make sense

54,@CryptoBillss @coolcatsnft Is there proof?
55,@printer_brrr @coolcatsnft @CryptoMories @cloncast @evanluza With the amount that project is made this type of behavior is disgusting if true.
56,@rj @CaptainMorie Very curious to find out who it is. I have suspicions
57,@NFTbark I hope I’m wrong but if it’s who I think it is then it’s a pretty fucked up DMCA when the person who filed has a project with pretty good floors and has made enough already.

77,@JustShootLight That’s terrible but like you said not surprising. Unfortunately this is only the beginning
78,@JustShootLight Obviously the biggest worry is how the Russian government treats any protesters.
79,I think a lot of people are underestimating the people of these two countries. Ukrainians won’t go down without a fight and Russian citizens have been struggling for years and cutting banks off won’t help. Interesting times ahead.
