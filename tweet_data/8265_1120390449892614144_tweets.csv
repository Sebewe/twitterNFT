2,"@Rylowery11 This specific type of retirement in the registry means it is tokenized and cannot be used for offsetting claims

Agree education is need to help explain the difference and understand how the tokenization process works"
3,@jPhilippe_D All of the above! :)
4,"@Rylowery11 Not true, plenty of corporate and institutional interest already

Yes a tokenized state instead of tokenizing via the retirement function would be more clean

Disagree about needing two way bridge for offsetting"
5,"@jPhilippe_D On-boarding new users. Number of unique DeFi users,  smol. Number of people who want to fix the planet, big."

19,"@ToddPeoples Yes, but if the corporations want to hold the credits they would need a wallet, but you could retire/hold on their behalf.

For sure, systems to streamline this would make a lot of sense to build out"

Brokers can bridge or redeem specific projects and in their wallet build a curated offering

Big opportunity to build applications to make this use case seamless"
25,"To expand the ecosystem, we need simple user experiences to bring new users into ReFi including:
-Fiat onramps
-Visual education on wallets/DEXs/NFTs etc.
-UI to access all the top ReFi use cases
-A welcoming community

Has anyone nailed this/who is working on this?"
26,"@__g0rd0n Agree those solutions are a good fit and we might not need a ReFi L2, though it would help bootstrap an ecosystem

Things that would help make it ReFi-native might be ReFi token liquidity mining rewards + buying ReFi tokens + offsetting with on-chain carbon"
27,"@__g0rd0n Ethereum PoS is only the changing the consensus mechanisms for the layer 1 chain, still need L2s on top to achieve scalability/low cost

If there was a safe way to bridge assets I would be more inclined to this view

Any other similar network technology that has not consolidated over time?"
33,"Over time ReFi will gravitate towards one or two ecosystems and chains, otherwise we face:
-Fractured liquidity
-Poor usability
-Reliance on unsafe bridges

45,@themitak Oh boy😅
46,@gregory_landua That's a statement about ReFi I can get behind!
47,"@timrann Agree - it is a tough but super important challenge

As you point out, even after appropriately designing such systems, bringing in proper representation is another tough problem

But the much bigger opportunity is embedding carbon into the fabric of all commerce and finance

An interesting business should exist to support regular businesses in integrating tokenized carbon"

57,"@listofdaos @ToucanProtocol @ReFiDAOist @climateXcrypto @johnx25bd @blacklivesdao @Web3Familia That is a great idea, if got any connections at @blacklivesdao or @Web3Familia would love to talk about how we could do something around ReFi together

Yes the first part of the journey has such a disproportionate impact"
58,"@climateXcrypto There absolutely needs to be ways to hold the community accountable for their actions which is hard with anonymity - we don't need a ReFi Sifu 

Fine with anonymity for those that prefer, but if you want to allocate millions it shouldn't be an option"
59,"@MarceloAlt5 Great points, thank you @MarceloAlt5 for sharing!"
60,"@listofdaos Amazing read, thank you for sharing. Such a good point. Perhaps @ToucanProtocol /@ReFiDAOist can run specific activities to support diversity, eg grants/hackathons/support forums tailored to underrepresented communities? 

Thoughts @climateXcrypto @johnx25bd"

67,"@jessewldn @RvrsToken Agree, I am hopeful we can and will design DAOs to optimize for different outcomes than profit maximization

If we stop at plain token voting and the biggest tokenholders end up being the same as in public markets, we are back to the same default - but we wont stop there"
68,"@finrenton @danielrion 100% agree, believe @ReFiDAOist is one of the most positive forces helping shape ReFi for the planet

That's such a good point, engagement should play a much larger role in determining governance power

Any good examples of engagement based voting? Curious how to measure it best"
69,"@jessewldn @RvrsToken Shareholders in an LLC can only indirectly push for extraction through board selection/articles etc.

With plain token voting, tokenholders will directly influence policies in favor of extraction

Though DAOs have more flexibility to customize token voting design than LLCs"
70,"@canerveli Good point, if a project is profitable by being effective and deploys a portion of the profit for good, that's a good outcome 

Someone like @ReFiDAOist needs to help shape what the standard of purposeful profit means"
71,"@tmoindustries Completely agree, in a sense all our prosperity comes from competing drives to profit, but so does all our environmental problems

Just worry we will repeat the same mistakes, and then ReFi becomes more about profitability than solving the ecological crisis"
72,"@RvrsToken Cool, thanks!

Cudos for foregoing a team allocation"
73,"@TealMacaron I know many founders in ReFi (incl myself) who care significantly more about the mission than personal gain and want to design systems that are purely for good

But you are probably right, as long as the profit motive still drives positive outcomes it's fine"
74,@Cloudunetwork But if this decentralized community wants personal gain they will drive towards extraction?
75,@tmoindustries @Weinberg Love that idea!
76,"@danielrion Sounds like the right direction, guess more specifically what are the mechanisms that enforce this? Would somehow need to be baked into the fabric of the organization, but not sure how"
77,"@danielrion For sure, question is how we design a system of governance that actually produces good outcomes over time?"
78,"@RvrsToken Anywhere can read further on your tokenomics?

Token locking sure can make token voting less bad but its still has worse incentive structures than even normal LLCs over time"
79,"@Weinberg Agree, but what is the design that long term will create good outcomes?

Token vote creates incentives for projects to extract as it benefits tokenholders, curios what good examples exist of alternatives"
80,"Hope ReFi does not become a collection of profit driven entities built to extract value from individuals who want to do good

86,"@nic__carter @thetrocro Using on-chain carbon such as @ToucanProtocol $NCT or $BCT you could easily program a contract that will offset all of your BTC footprint automatically with full fungibility

Eg @ReturnProtocol are doing this for Ethereum blockspace use

DMs open if you want to explore this"
87,"@rexstjohn Completely agree, think there will be multiple great businesses built around what you described

We hope the TCO2 token standard in our meta-registry will be supporting such applications and enabling interoperability between many sources of carbon"
88,"@MLBinWA Yes hopefully all of ReFi will be massively carbon negative. If I have to shill some projects:
-OGs: @KlimaDAO @regen_network @moss_earth 
-Newer: @diatomdao @ReturnProtocol @WeAreFlowCarbon 

Big respect to all of the above"
89,"@alhudecki @tmoindustries Love where you are going with this

In a way I think ReFi should go beyond just offsetting emissions but create abundant positive externalities

Eg Toucan using 50% of its redemption fee to offset, this is probably many times larger than our footprint 😎"
90,"@SevNightingale @__g0rd0n For sure one of the biggest benefits, more money directly to the carbon project 🌳"
91,"@rexstjohn Good question, in my opinion we want to optimize for:
-Increasing $$$ directly to carbon projects
-Increasing retirements

Retirements are still tiny on-chain and it is a bit tricky to quantify $$$ to carbon projects

Would be a good masters thesis or something to quantify this"

93,"@climateXcrypto @ReFiDAOist @deworkxyz @daryljedwards @re_sourcelife @Aleborda21 @radi_triz For sure would be a fun experiment to run!

Question how far we want to lean into bounty models vs for example @coordinape?

Creating bounties introduce overhead vs ""just getting the work done"", so might make more sense for certain areas

Can also try:
https://t.co/MxjssaPGIi"
94,"@dfp2017 @__g0rd0n Because blockchains offer an immutable public ledger, any offsets can be traced and it is easier to apply consistent carbon accounting rules

Agree, on-chain carbon does not solve and inherits credit quality issues from the traditional carbon market"
95,"@ShanuMathew93 Imo the web3 community needs to do a better job of calling people out who make bogus claims, even if the people doing this will get some heat 😅

Know I have myself not done good enough of a job of this but based on all the positive feedback here I will give it a try"
96,"@__g0rd0n But I agree, it is not like on-chain activity is driving the market yet even if it has a significant impact on certain segments of the market"
97,"@__g0rd0n It's a good question, I would say three key value drivers are:
-blockchains improve transparency and avoid double counting
-tokenization allows integration with DeFi tools (eg liquid markets/collateral)
-New sources of demand by enabling anyone to access credits"
98,"Overselling carbon offsets or inflating the impact on-chain carbon has on the world will not benefit the space long term

Brokers trading offsets =\= funding climate action 

Holding credits =\= offsetting

ReFi can do a lot of good but we should not accept false advertising"
