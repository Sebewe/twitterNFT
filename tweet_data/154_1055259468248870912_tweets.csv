32,@SA1NT99 @OttoSuwenNFT launch execution was PERFECT. rarely do you see projects do public before whitelist sale. imo you cannot do whitelist sale first otherwise you attract flashbotters who know what secondary floor already is
33,"@SA1NT99 @OttoSuwenNFT to add on to this, and i agree with everything saint said, i was very drawn by their dedication to web3 values and ethos. for me some of this was signaled by their “fuck zucc” and “racing zucc to the metaverse” posts. the rest were signaled in social media/azuki site posts"

high number of discord members but only a small fraction of those are online (botted discord)

53,"the bubble will burst eventually and we’ll see the next amazon, facebook, etc arise from the ashes. my bet is on @AzukiZen; strong core team with big tech backgrounds and experience building products. i’m blown away by the quality of the work they’ve done so far https://t.co/ENugB0Ew6o"
54,@jumpmanft damn this is very true
55,@ZoddLooksRare @DegenSpartan can you guys prioritize adding basic filtering and search features? platform is unusable for people with lots of scam NFTs that would normally be hidden on OS

84,@AikonMishima @jumpmanft @NFTethics @zachxbt i think recently (past few months) there are a lot of people coming via instagram. and instagram is full of these cash grab projects. i think the good actors mainly live on twitter so rip to the instagram sheep buyers 💀
85,@WickdNFT lmao complete shitshow of a platform. still don’t even have basic filter or search functions. how tf am i supposed to list something if i have to sift through 2k shit NFTs that would otherwise be in my hidden folder on OS
86,@AikonMishima @jumpmanft i’m gonna start retweeting more from @NFTethics and @zachxbt. having a centralized hub of this info is a great idea i think
87,@jumpmanft yeah recently seems like there are mass adoption catalysts every week so the buy pressure will continue
88,@jumpmanft i’m ready for a bear market to clean out all the trash projects but yeah seems like buyers are getting smarter

94,@jumpmanft @OttoSuwenNFT @SneakyninjaNFTs @zachxbt no ser not short sighted at all. we are thinking on the right track. we should reach out to these accounts and ask them how we can support their efforts. just opening a discussion/bringing more awareness is a great start!
95,@OttoSuwenNFT @jumpmanft @SneakyninjaNFTs @zachxbt mmm agreed with otto. but wouldn’t be opposed to your idea either @jumpmanft. it gets a bit tricky when money is involved i guess
96,"@NFTethics welcome back, appreciate the hard work you do 🙏"
97,@OttoSuwenNFT @jumpmanft @KarafuruNFT wait how so? i missed super bowl info what’s going on?
