16,@VinnieHager Done
17,@honey_crisp_ @opensea @Trezor I have seen @OGDfarmer post on this a few times. Check his feed. Seems like they are aware and it hasn't been fixed yet.
18,Time for a good post since Twitter is so dark and down lately. This was a @Mrs_ETHNick special! https://t.co/kkDC5t35aM

21,"@pitpanther01 @moonpay Good call, there are some great projects. I am currently staking @ElrondApes, have @Maiarpunks ready for farming, and own a bunch of @drifters_nft."
22,"@GKoz2 @iamDCinvestor China holds about 3.4T in USD reserves and M2 money supply is just under 22T, so I'd imagine if china wanted, it could do some damages, at its own expense too."
23,@ericgoldenx That is a good point.
24,"Also, not sure of not certain of the reporting credibility from this page."
25,"@BorisVagner Mine are much older, but I'll never forget moments like these!"
26,Germany raising defense spending and this. Who would have thought we could fire back up the Cold War so fast. https://t.co/UR7XsOImuy
27,"@ericgoldenx I hope so and realize it is still in demand, just can't help thinking it is on a dangerous path. Although, maybe global disorder is good for American trade 🤷"
28,"@ericgoldenx Also, clearly Russian markets are fucked. This is basically ensuring no foreign investors touch your market even if this temporary."
29,"@ericgoldenx I have this feeling we are at the start of the USD decline as the global reserve currency.

China has to look to be off it and we may see a backing away from rate hikes. Could be a cascade of inflation and foreign reserves dumping for more stable currencies or digital assets."

41,@cliffordcushion Ohh... didn't know that. Gotta look into it now. Figured this is just the new appealing style lol
42,@LadyApeFundy You start your mint at 3eth. Nothing deserves that valuation from an unproven team.

51,"It happened!

Went to a Carolina hockey game and dude sitting next to me notices my BAYC hoodie in the 3rd period! Lol. Turns out his buddy has three apes.

Pretty cool convo."
52,"@Jdotcolombo It's funny that a community (NFT/CT Twitter) that presents itself as open minded can literally take a group of diverse people and generalize them based on an NFT project they have as their pfp. 

As if behind those PFPs aren't people from all walks of life. Always found it weird."
