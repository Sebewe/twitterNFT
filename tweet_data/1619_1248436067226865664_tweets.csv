22,"This is the simplest analogy to explain the concept of an MEV trading strategy that demonstrates the basic relationships between a MEV trader, normal buyers, mempools, orders, AMMs, etc.

plz gib feedback

I am looking to get sponsored/paid FT to do web3 technical writing!

(6/6)"
23,"(including AMM)
A MT can artificially inflate the price by buying the food ahead of buyers; the AMM automatically raises the price in response; e.g. they buy food at $10 to auto-boost the price to something like $12; so the MEV trader scans orders to buy low sell high

(5/6)"
24,"(ignoring AMM minus gas and swap fees)
Here's a theoretical example of profits a MT can get per ""order offer"" in the mempool:

At $10, MTs capture $0, since $10-$10=$0 profit
At $12, MTs capture $2, since $12-$10=$2 profit
At $20, MTs capture $10, since $20-$10=$10 profit

(4/6)"
25,"A MT can take advantage of the design of Automated Market Makers (AMM); AMMs are predefined pricing algorithms that automatically adjusts prices based on the volume of incoming orders; if demand (order volume) goes up, so does the price; if demand down, price down

(3/6)"
26,"MEV trading is one way to extract profit from everyday transactions/users

People submitting lunch orders also submit the price they're willing to pay for lunch; it takes time for orders to be made in the kitchen- this waiting time is where a MEV trader (MT) makes profit!!

(2/6)"
27,"(DISCLAIMER: This analogy I'm about to go into is very close to something called a Sandwich attack (https://t.co/dCtHheVj8k); 

MEV exists when sandwich profit - gas &gt; 0, so it's more common on low-fee chains at lower amounts)"
28,"Here's the simplest, non-technical analogy for MEV defi noobs (MEV= Miner Extractable Value) ✨
