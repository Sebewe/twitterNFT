Some people can time the market and profitably swing trade.

Most cannot, and attempting to do so will see them eaten alive with fees, tax, and, you know, just straight up timing things incorrectly.

If you add in the equity of revealing a rare, I’d say on average those that sold within like the 24hrs before reveal took a loss

Those that got lucky and sold the pre reveal top of 13+ prob did well 👍"

99,"@roundcatcrypto With all due respect, sometimes sharing incomplete information as a cautionary tale is better than sharing no information. 

There were multiple sources calling this a scam/hack/asking ppl not to donate (including freaking Vitalik).

Better to err on the side of safety."
