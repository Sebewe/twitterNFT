12,@CryptoCrocoFR @nftworldsNFT Right there with you. It's hard to accept it as a learning experience and keep pushing forward. Hopefully we'll have the foresight to pick up on the next gem.

14,@AJ94763548 @nftworldsNFT Those are great picks! I've been listening to this is not a t-shirt by bobby hundreds. That's a world I don't understand at all and that book has been a nice glance into it.
15,@AJ94763548 @nftworldsNFT I wanted to get into MAYC at 4 but didn't have enough. I never would have guessed BAYC going to 100.
16,@nftavs @nftworldsNFT That's very true and I'm not sure. Haven't had anything increase like that to know.
17,@LizardLips_777 This is spot on.
18,@CryptoShaman14 @nftworldsNFT Mine are 6 and 8. Turn off chat and let them roam!
19,"@SolboyJag @nftworldsNFT I hope so. Hard to keep track of so many projects. Even only the ones mentioned in alpha channels. I need to find a group that divies up projects, everyone does research on their project, then shares."
20,@CryptoShaman14 @nftworldsNFT Putting the kids to work playing on the test server to farm some. I'm going to grab some after the next drop. Hoping for a little sell off and reduced price. Since I feel that way it will go to $1 at that point.
21,@IAmMach1ne @nftworldsNFT Good way to think of it.
22,Saw @nftworldsNFT at 0.2 and didn't grab one. I'm not yet able to brush off these misses. Selling one at current floor would have paid off student debt. That's making it for me. So close! Great work by that team!
