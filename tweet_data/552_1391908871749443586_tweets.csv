1. Celeb endorsement from someone who to this point has not been involved in the space
2. Massive discord numbers. If an upcoming project is already at 6 figures, that’s not good

11,"@boredbuildernft @v_earth_io Be able to clearly and concisely communicate what your project is trying to achieve. From reading your site, I'm lost on what the goal is and why I would want to bring private information about myself (my home address) into an NFT project."
12,"@boredbuildernft @v_earth_io There are plenty of new projects that have succeeded without influencer hype. Turf, for example. If you build something great, there are other paths to finding an audience."
13,"If you're learning about new NFT projects through Twitter whitelist giveaways, you're probably underperforming.

Spend more time finding trustworthy communities on Discord. You'll get your best information there."
