4,@CanteringClark exogenous sounds dirty
5,@notsofast @OCDecaf @osmosiszone I think trade volume matters less than the relative prices of osmo &amp; atom. The arbers won't sleep on a market imbalance. ATM osmo seems like a better hold than atom... Which is why I prefer just staking osmo - but like I said I'm doing both.
6,"@notsofast @OCDecaf @osmosiszone Do the rewards outweigh the il when compared to just staking osmo? I'm doing both, and have done zero math, but my gut tells me that straight staking is the better play."

87,"@RuzhyoX @0xSifu Reading the proposal, he has paid his debt to society, and has been a good actor in the defi space, despite opportunities to do otherwise. I believe there should be a path to redemption. Why force him to be anon? If he is known, people can choose if they want to trust him or not."
88,"I never had of any of the coins he was involved in, so I don't have a vote here. I think it would be a victory for the space to reinstate @0xSifu if he wants it.

Cancel culture and mob mentality should be (imho) avoided. I have done and said things I would not repeat - I'm human https://t.co/GBI664M3gb"
89,"@Ptmhc1973 @dafacto @0xSifu @Osxifu I was wondering the same. The link seems p based... This is a facet of the cancel culture thing. 

Lines need to be drawn - we each have our own world views, risk tolerance, available time to do research, etc. BUT these lines imho, should be personal choices not mob rule."
