8,@NFTHawks People knowing a project is a cash grab but still minting because they are degenerate gamblers
9,"Thanks so much for all the well wishes about our good news.

12,"@superkid_eth @KDino1313 Legislation will come, it just can’t keep up with the pace of innovation in the space. Projects that surround themselves with people capable of interpreting the law and future legislation will be the ones lefts standing ⛈"
13,"@superkid_eth @KDino1313 I also think there will be a shift when the platforms like OS, CB etc become KYC compliant. You’re totally right though, there’s so many implications projects are not aware of and it’s going to bite a lot in the butt."
14,"@superkid_eth @KDino1313 KYC compliance hasn’t actually been made mandatory for NFTs but I think the way that new projects must operate, if they are being responsible, is to err on the side of caution and seek counsel from professionals to make themselves as compliant with the existing legislation"
