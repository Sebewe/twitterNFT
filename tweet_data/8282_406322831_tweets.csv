Whether it's direct incentives to holders or indirectly using the funds to increase LIT/BOOK value to the benefit of holders. We'll figure something out :)"
96,"@bradyevanwalker @neilstrauss @LITWTF Soon as plans are more defined, will have a request for contributors that can help us achieve our goals for the book!

These would be volunteers in the beginning, I think they should be rewarded as well.

We can form a working squad and use @coordinape to allocate."

98,"@CryptoRaposa @neilstrauss @LITWTF tbh its undecided atm! What do you think would make more sense.

On one hand book holders is logical choice, on the other hand we want to be able to activate and align incentives with greater $LIT community... go big or go home right?"

S/O again to @neilstrauss &amp; the @LITWTF team/community for making this happen. More exciting things to come :)
