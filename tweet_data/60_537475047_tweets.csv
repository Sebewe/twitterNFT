In a world where social media algorithms are centralised I cannot be certain that my successes are caused by real, authentic appreciation or the sum of algorithmic approvement and promotion.

Oh, and make it fully interoperable."

You stand a couple meters apart from your opponent. Then you throw your CrazyBone at your opponents. The first to knock the others down would win BOTH crazy bones.
