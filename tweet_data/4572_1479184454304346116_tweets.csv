0,@Itz_Feel @itstylersays At least they own NFTs.
1,@lovennft I feel even more discriminated after this message.
2,@lovennft Imagine a man would say that he is gonna start a “NFT meet up for men only. The world would go crazy. Is this equality?
3,@WizKingNFT Tell me more. Where and how? Isn’t it just 5% p.a.?
4,@pdxmittons @JA50Neth @BoredApeYC @LazyLionsNFT Crazy. I didn’t know. I’m sorry.
5,@BobbyBananasNFT This is so amazing. I was thinking about something similar. Would love to have some basic information on there. There are still so many people that never heard of NFT at all.
6,@pdxmittons @JA50Neth @BoredApeYC @LazyLionsNFT ? I don’t get it.
7,@BobbyBananasNFT Is this real?
8,"@keph_art LOL, good one."
9,Can somebody tell me please? @LazyLionsNFT https://t.co/DnZsbD5PBk
10,@BobbyBananasNFT I don’t know what “the community” really means in the NFT space. 🙆‍♂️🤷🤐
11,@BobbyBananasNFT I only watched one part of Star Wars and I didn’t liked it.
12,@JA50Neth @BoredApeYC We are crazy early. I wear my @LazyLionsNFT sweater and never anybody recognized it.
13,@smems_ Good question. I think it is really strange to have a really big Twitter account and don’t even have the product launch announced.
14,@TAR1008 @baro_walk @LazyLionsNFT Should we start sub-gangs if we are all #kings. I even would consider all NFT owners in the NFT gang. We will tell our grand children about it.
15,@ethernaz 🤚
16,@TrilliDAOnaire I call bullshit. Instant block.
17,"@chriscantino A! 
If you have 10%, you can not chose to sell. In worst case you are stuck with that money for a long time."
18,@DaGoatNFT 🐢
19,@TimHaldorsson @BoredApeYC Why is this a promoted tweet? 🧐
20,@PuffYatty @0xmorphix LOL
21,"RT @PuffYatty: first they ignore you

then they laugh at you

then they ask you which NFT to buy"
22,"@RealAdamBraatz @DiscoverXnft Awesome graphic, instant follow! 👍 do you have more knowledge written down somewhere? Thank you"
23,@MKP_NFT You are 100% right. It was just the first thing what came to my mind. 😜
24,"@bayc8925 @opensea 👍👍 I thought you were talking about the big drop. But yes, you are right in general."
25,"@MKP_NFT If you would ask this the other way around, it could be a viral tweet. 😉🤷"
26,@bayc8925 It is only because @opensea changed the contract and delisted all NFTs for this.
27,@yaaagin_ @LazyLionsNFT we are awesome. 😜 https://t.co/4grnxEYzsE
28,@ElliotAvidane @BoredApeYC I feel you! I block every OxApe I see.
29,@jm__kelley @LazyLionsNFT I wait for the day a person in real life recognize my @LazyLionsNFT swag.
30,"@BobbySolez Sorry @BobbySolez if this is what you are doing here, you have my unfollow."
31,@BobbySolez @PUMA @LazyLionsNFT Now or never ;)
32,@CryptoDB5 Had the same. Can we block this list adding scams? It is so annoying.
33,RT @chadgelina: male birth control is free and it's called having an android.
34,@chadgelina LOL
35,In my point of view the utility is the real purpose of a NFT. https://t.co/IAVKaxpUVZ
36,@Disicate @LazyLionsNFT There are 5.000 and you follow ~700… this is 14% and not 90%.
37,"@orangie @LazyLionsNFT Never too late, it is just the beginning! https://t.co/qxy7hVw8h3"
38,Probably nothing... https://t.co/GwQkb6PYAq https://t.co/EKXumcFBcH
39,@ZachBoychuk If you want a great project you should take a @LazyLionsNFT. Even @Coinbase_NFT has a @LazyLionsNFT Bungalow as a Twitter Background. https://t.co/aqXErJ7eyE
40,@BombNFTs @LazyLionsNFT are the real blue chips https://t.co/RkxHkHhqxz
41,@salvatoreferari I ask myself if the OxApes are even legal?
42,"RT @salvatoreferari: If I follow you and you own an OxApe NFT, please let me know so I can unfollow you 🤝"
43,@JulianLallo @LazyLionsNFT @RomanCraig15 Nice one
44,@themonsterguild @maris_milton @LazyLionsNFT It’s really nice to have it also in RL.
45,@WomenTribe_nfts Damn
46,@maris_milton @LazyLionsNFT Already following. 👍 https://t.co/un4GFeF5nv
47,@the_freightrain Hope I get to mint some @WomenTribe_nfts
48,@BoredApe4662 I bought my lion on 01-04-22 for 1.9 ETH (7.200 $). A day later the ETH value dropped a lot. If I would sell now for 2 ETH I would have 1.2K loss. 😅🤷 I’m a bit jealous. But I Hodl and maybe have the same story next year. ;)
49,"@LoganJames @cr0ssETH Do you think this is funny? If you take a picture of the Mona Lisa, do you own the Mona Lisa?"
50,"@0xkayzy @LazyLionsNFT @AshurNFT Great, thank you. Also followed you."
51,"@MKP_NFT Sounds interesting, but this is not my field, I'm sorry. Wish you luck!"
52,@MKP_NFT What kind of business? Would be happy to help if I’m able to. Just hit me up via DM.
53,"@CryptoShaman14 @LazyLionsNFT Great, thank you!"
54,@CryptoShaman14 @LazyLionsNFT Where do you find this graph?
55,@FFVV1211 @BoredApeYC #halogang have fun bro. 😜 https://t.co/Ickq35DqmL
56,"You can now edit your Bungalow with your NFTs. This is so amazing. I love it.
@LazyLionsNFT @SelfMadePunks https://t.co/i8aZaEZ6uo"
57,@ZachBoychuk @LazyLionsNFT But I would never leave the community. Would buy just the next lion. ;)
58,@ZachBoychuk @LazyLionsNFT https://t.co/aHhujK2CJD I would be interested in an offer. https://t.co/lLZh6aKXKf
59,Do you have a solution to be part of @TwitterBlue outside of the US? I really want to verify my NFT.
60,@themonsterguild @LazyLionsNFT For me it is the @Coinbase_NFT partnership. The first reveal started today. This could be huge.
61,"@BokmanDavid @LazyLionsNFT Damn, I also want to verify. But I can’t. Tried with VPN, but it doesn’t work. If anybody knows how please tell me."
62,@danny17172 This is only part of the story in my point of view. And sometimes not telling the whole story is the same like lying.
63,@PaulCMA1 Nice
64,@BAYC5518 Provide value for the community and engage.
65,@BAYC5518 You should not. Giveaways are mostly scams.
66,"@BAYC5518 Everybody knows him, but what is about this picture? I don’t see a problem."
67,@PaulCMA1 It works only if you also follow back. 🦁😉 https://t.co/91X60DrtU9
68,@NatalieGarciaMX @noncoducks We should think about the web3 thing… 🙈😉
69,"@ethernaz @Believeandi @LazyLionsNFT Best community in Twitter. I bought a Lion and within 1 Month I got 1.000 Followers, starting from 0. I write Lions directly on Twitter, everyone is responding, nice and clever."
70,@PltTiger It is so annoying… what can we do about it?
71,"RT @RaoulGMI: Opinion - Discord is unusable. Endless feed of stuff, all the time, everything gets lost, zero curation, cant track anything,…"
72,"RT @Coinbase_NFT: New banner, new bungalow ...

Current status: living like kings 🦁🌴 @LazyLionsNFT https://t.co/tczo82Qz0T"
73,RT @YourNextNFT: O M G ! I didn't realize @Coinbase_NFT has @LazyLionsNFT bungalow as Twitter banner ! That's huge!
74,"Hey @LazyLionsNFT community. I just minted a great @SelfMadePunks. It’s a fun project, you can built it your own. And I never saw such a low gas fee of 5$. Do your thing, give me some love and #roar it up. https://t.co/QttjhNVeE5 https://t.co/bkUK5YBXSu"
75,@ilovelazylions I would be also interested.
76,In my opinion it is the wrong decision to incentivize to hodl the @LazyLionsNFT. Everyone is looking at the stats of the traded volume. We need to be in there. https://t.co/k9uOXmgOQU
77,@TodamoonOnARock @Coinbase_NFT LOL
78,@BrendanBald @Coinbase_NFT LOL
79,@Coinbase_NFT I pay fees of hundreds of $ without a blink of an eye.
80,"@dymorega @heidiklum Amazing, thank you king. Yes, great present."
81,@sibeleth @heidiklum @crypt0dad_ Can you tell me the #? I can’t find it.
82,Yes please! https://t.co/BGcEZYqNeY
83,@heidiklum I’m not able to find this cryptopunk on OpenSea. Can somebody tell the #? https://t.co/lxA8V2oKuB
84,Probably nothing… just @heidiklum buying a punk https://t.co/pFoIal89Ak
85,"gm

Did anybody figured out how to get a hexagon #nft profile picture outside of the USA? Please tell me."
86,"@JRNYcrypto It sound good, because we all paid hundreds if not thousands in gas fees. But how would you feel if you buy a hoodie and pay 23$ transaction fees? I still think if we are not able to significantly decrease gas fees, #nft will not succeed in a long run."
87,"I'm going to run a half-marathon soon, what do you think if I print my lion on my shirt for this? Wouldn't it be cool if some @LazyLionsNFT run together? https://t.co/Fh0QjIALQw"
88,"@andypngr LOL, but you probably own a really cool lion."
89,RT @nairb621: A Louis Vuitton scarf is $1000 (~0.317 Eth) and people think NFTs are a scam? 🤣
90,"The #ETH chart looks pretty promising. Fingers crossed, that it breaks the blue line. https://t.co/76ExpDVRzm"
91,"@cr0ssETH We create our own NFT bubble and don’t realize, that we are so early. Nearly everyday when I tell people about NFT in RL, they don’t know what I’m talking about. And think I’m crazy buying pictures for thousands of $. They will understand eventually."
92,Would love to do this with my lion. https://t.co/Yr9KKKiNxv
93,I followed everyone! 👍 thank you!
94,@LivingPixelated @LazyLionsNFT Thank you Ace! 👍
95,"@Cryptui2 @LazyLionsNFT Easy, you are almost there. 👍"
96,I promise I will keep on following everyone.
97,So crazy! I had a twitter account for more than 10 years and always wanted a thousand followers. Now I reached 1K in less than 1 month after I bought my lion and got part of the #nft community. Thank you everyone!
