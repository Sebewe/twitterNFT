24,"@DJBotwinNFT I don't see the staking reward earning as quickly as the $LOOKS one did. The mechanics of $x2y2 don't seem to favor wash sales to generate fees. However, staking free money doesn't hurt. I might go 50% staked, 50% cash out."

42,@WayfarerMuse @Crypto__Chicks Missing blue lipstick. So close. Nice work. CC's are killing it. Top 5 community.
43,@Ya_sazonova The #DAW just seems range bound between .56 - .74. If gas wasn't such a high percentage of the buy/sell it would be a great trading vehicle.
44,.@BranSymondson Why the block? Is it because I was playing around with your art? I don't get it.
45,"Hey, @Kalash47NFT why the block? WTH?"
46,@KenErwin88 I do it overnight when gas fees are lower. https://t.co/RdwQNxjqvd

51,Prediction. $LOOKS is about to bounce. At $4.02 now. I am going to sell my original staked amount at $4.39 and I will regret it for years to come. Or not. Sooooo. Up or down. It will go up or down. https://t.co/cApucqDQjL

53,"Imagine how valuable that could be when Coinbase, Gamestop, ETC have their own marketplaces.

Exciting possibilities. The best part is that it is in my normal activity flow. No behavior change necessary. 
@kevinrose @garyvee @pranksy  Take a look."
54,Is it in the roadmap to become a marketplace aggregator within your inspect window? That would be amazing time saver. Offer a premium subscription/pass to aggregate pricing across markets.
55,"@nftinspect I was pleasantly surprised that it is also pulling the #SolanaNFTs collections. A lot less visibility in that space, but that won't always be the case and this tool will help with understanding."
56,"@nftinspect Oak, I am loving your tool already. A big time saver when digging around in the #NFT space. Impressive work."
