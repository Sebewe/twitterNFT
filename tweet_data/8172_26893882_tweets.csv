13,"@matthewegould Less concerned about your uninformed post than your disrespect for people losing their lives in a war right now. 

You just falsely claimed that the ENS team used a war to hide a vote against Brantly. The timing of the two events is demonstrably and absolutely unrelated."

75,"@ottodv Your explanation of delegation is spot on. 

To cover the gas cost reduces the barriers to redelegation. One DAO member may chose to redelegate depending on the upcoming proposals, while others want to set and forget. 

This gives the option without the penalty gas of fees."
