75,@Kronkyland I mean it's probably because we all had our expectations pretty low and didn't expect it to not be a hot mess haha
76,@ronclaude93 I was just talking about that! It's tough because the nostalgia of Pokemon hit harder.. I think I liked Sonic more because the supporting actors were better? Yea Sonic
