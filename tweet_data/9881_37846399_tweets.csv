0,Pretty cool way to make up for ordering two! https://t.co/IdDhF0zyPp
1,@paddingtonphoto Congrats! That sounds like a great gig.
2,@benjhaisch I really thought about doing that and ordering a tool chest but it would be extremely impractical for my current situation so I landed on just getting another back pack for my gear. I want to get a large pelican or nanuk case soon though.
3,"I didn't receive notice that the models, makeup artists or others had twitter. I tagged them in my posts on other social medias like Facebook!"
4,@forrestfire Awesome. Thank you for sharing. I did recently have to have a book from blurb reprinted because it wasn’t trimmed properly. But after a quick email they immediately sent me a new copy with the irregularities fixed.
5,@notachickie @Cory_Babstock Unfortunately you’ll have to take my word for it cause I can’t seem to find it again. The internet can be a bit of a black hole sometimes 😅
6,@lorigraceaz @paperthynn @alljustpaul @ParraDeSys Thank you for the suggestion. I’ll follow you and all those you tagged and I’ll look for them in spaces. Thanks again.
7,@Cory_Babstock Read a study once that it’s not the hustle and bustle of the city that we want to escape but the incessant loud noise. The study seemed to allude that it’s not nature we humans desire but quiet. Simple silence that is almost impossible to come by in modern day.
8,@lorigraceaz Reaching out is so hard these days because people often assume you just want to use them as a wrung on the latter. It sucks because I’ve attempted to reach out to many photographers who’ve dismissed me assuming I was just trying to use them. I just wished for a bit of interaction
9,@tknep3 @tristan_todd_ Awesome. I’m so happy to hear that!
10,@forrestfire I’m in stages of making my first photo book. I’m quite happy with the quality of other photographers books I’ve ordered from blurb. If you don’t mind me asking what aren’t you happy with about blurbs work? I would love to know before I commit to using them for my book. Thank you!
11,@tknep3 @tristan_todd_ It takes even more emotional intelligence to know that you shouldn’t gate keep and try to knock others down in an attempt to reduce “competition”. Photography is art and there’s no such thing. Just make your work. No need to compare or berate others.
12,@tknep3 @tristan_todd_ That’s something I seriously hate about any photography community. Jealousy and inferiority complexes are rampant. Even if the photog doesn’t know that’s what their experiencing. It takes a great deal of emotional intelligence to know that your jealous of someone’s work.
13,"@courtneyrphotos As a photographer is so nice to hear this. I always strive to tag models, make up artists, hair stylists and anyone else who had a hand in the creation of an image. It’s only fair. Most great images are not created single handedly, especially ones involving studios and such."
14,Hey y’all. Im looking for some more photographers to connect with who don’t have a large following here on Twitter. Im also looking for some photo YouTubers who would like to connect! Hit me with your suggestions! Thank you!
15,@FaheyJames1 Just subbed. Since you’re a photographer it would (imo) greatly improve the video if you included some of your images in the video!
16,@FaheyJames1 Dang good. I’m at like 16 after 6 vids lol. Im working on it though!
17,@joelle_lb I think it really depends on the time of year. I have a guide book that details the busiest times of year for each park. It’s handy and I plan to one day visit each park in it’s off season to make the most of the visit.
18,@jaserhunter Congrats on that milestone! Never understood how to effectively use Instagram myself. Hit about 600 and just got stuck. No matter what I did I couldn’t seem to get any momentum on that platform. I’m happy to see others have such success though!
19,@benjhaisch I know that feeling. For some reason it feels like they don’t count because they’re your parents and they are supposed to encourage you regardless. Gotta accept that thier compliments are as valid and honest as anyone else’s!
20,@FotosOfWilliam @unworns 😂 priceless.
21,@shotbyde Glad to hear that! I’ve ordered from many photography stores and never had a problem with any of them. This was my third order from mpb. It was also the most costly one and that’s why it soured me to mpb so much. I’ll likely give them another chance one day on something cheaper.
22,@shotbyde Had a bad experience with mpb once. Long story short their customer service leaves a bit to be desired and was bad enough in my opinion that I actively let people know about it. Just a heads up.
23,@FlakPhoto People definitely act with less respect over social media. Always have and always will because there are little to no repercussions for this.
24,"Hands on photography workshops are almost always worth going to. Especially when you get to work with professional models, designers, makeup artists and hair stylists. Most of the greatest portraits you’ve ever seen were created by a team and not a lone photographer @FujifilmX_US https://t.co/DS2f97j5Ih"
25,@nate_levine My wife and I went to a pretty sick photo workshop! https://t.co/0ZfHvxjGUx
26,"RT @MrJayCroft: Most people won’t support you until it’s popular to support you 

Believe in yourself above all else"
27,@benjhaisch @AputureLighting @SonyAlpha Thanks! I’m looking into purchasing such a light and I’ve already got several modifiers laying around.
28,@marissac_photo Me too! Gotta get out of Kansas for a few days.
29,@benjhaisch @AputureLighting @SonyAlpha Totally understand if you don’t want to answer this question but is there any difference between a modifier used for strobes and one used for a constant light like these?
30,@RockyC137 Sure anytime.
31,@chaunce88 Sure. Anytime.
32,@FotosOfWilliam Exactly.
33,Welp. Ordered a podmic from @rodemics. What should my first ever talking head video be about? Thinking of making it about something simple like equivalent exposure. Considering this topic because understanding this simple concept changed how I shoot. Not sure though.
34,@zigmarillion Well. Photography. Like everyone else 😂. Value propositions are hard for me because what can I offer that someone else isn’t already? I just have to remind myself that no one can offer what I can even if it might be similar info it’ll be different because it’s coming from me.
35,@FlakPhoto Right.
36,@benjhaisch I’ve used color monkey in the past but recently I’ve accepted that (imo) there’s no reason to calibrate unless you’re printing your work from your printer. You also can’t control what a client is viewing your work on so might as well just let it go.
37,"@nic_sco Imo, photoshop is better used as a supplement to Lightroom for very specific tools. That’s how I use photoshop anyway. Only for the neural filters and sky replacement occasionally."
38,"@AnAndrewBrown @nic_sco Man, I said that once during a talk with some of my peers and they looked at me like I grew a third head."
39,@ChrisBPhoto Excellent and congrats! The xpro2 was my first real camera! You’ll make many beautiful images with that wonderful device.
40,You know what sucks? Paying thousands for an education and needing to supplement it with free YouTube. What sucks even worse is when the YouTube videos are more thorough than any college class you’ve ever taken and covers an entire semesters worth of info in 60 min or less.
41,@Eli173NFT Congratulations y’all.
42,@thatphotog1 Wedding industry is toxic as hell. That’s why for the time being I’m staying out of it unless someone asks me to be a second shooter or a close friends asks me to document their wedding. The competition and toxicity I’ve experienced just isn’t worth it.
43,@nate_levine @Lightroom @RawExports @ThatsMadLive @Canon Hmm. That’s a rough one. I think I prefer color but I prefer night photos in color in general anyway.
44,"@CMFleming70 Those fujis are really nice cameras. Best cameras out there, especially for the money, if you ask me."
45,"@mehtadushy @jaserhunter I think so. I can’t see much of a difference besides the colors. I’ve been working with Fuji since 2016 and I’ve never experienced what you’re describing. Perhaps you did get a bad copy. Oh well, returned it and are happy with your current camera, that’s all that matters!"
46,"@mehtadushy @jaserhunter Gotta say, two days? You barely gave it a chance. I’ve never used Panasonic because the brand never spoke to me like Fuji does. I do get returning a product on first blush though. Did that with a peak design backpack. Total crap compared to a lowepro protactic."
47,"@Photo_John @jaserhunter I’ve been shooting sports for the last several months for the local paper. Football, basketball, volleyball and such. I’ve never once had an issue with any of my Fuji gear not keeping up. Even with “slow” focusing lenses like the 56mm. Just my two sense."
48,"RT @zigmarillion: I want you to succeed. I really do! I also hope I can help more and more with that in the future!

So many of you out the…"
49,@PhotosbyADFP @FlakPhoto @ARTOLOGY_US @MidsCentral @urbangorillas @TheUrbanPG @StreetEvolution @RawExports @f20visuals @moment @PENTAXIAN Just the fact that you got out and shot is enough!
50,"Yup. Happens all the time. Right time, right place, right connections will all take you much farther than your skill with a camera ever will. https://t.co/DfSNtqMgOh"
51,@jaserhunter It definitely doesn’t. I’m a student right now and have access to as much canon gear as I want and let me tell you canon has NOTHING on the user experience that Fuji offers. Also Canon files suck.
52,Gotta love living in Kansas. Yesterday 75 degrees today 21.
53,@nate_levine I just bought the PhotoPills app cause I’m planning on trying that out! Can’t wait to see how it goes for you!
54,Welp. I’m awake much earlier than intended. Good morning y’all. Gm and all that.
55,@MarcEsadrian Pretty sure I’m going to have to do that soon!
56,@oldnikonfm3a I’ve got two of the same one just so I can have different layouts 😬
57,So uh. Anyone else spend hours agonizing over the layout of the dividers in their camera back pack? No just me? Ok.
58,@downtofowler Getting people to think your work is worth their time 😆
59,@benglasscophoto I see them!
60,Experienced this first hand recently. https://t.co/ITUvQCpugC
61,"RT @KSivachukArt: It's official, I like Twitter soooooo much better then Instagram. You may be getting more likes on IG but there is really…"
62,@NotKelseySmith Ah see I’ve always enjoyed beer. When I was a toddler I would steal my parents drinks when they weren’t looking 🤣
63,@blick_les Or you end up like Vincent Van Gogh and become successful in the afterlife 😅
64,@thatphotog1 Ah! I see. I worked in the shipping dept. at millers for about 5 years and I know exactly what you mean about no windows.
65,@NotKelseySmith Ah so it’s an acquired taste then!
66,@NotKelseySmith Not a coffee guy myself. Don’t like the taste but I love the smell. Strangest thing.
67,@thatphotog1 Not sure what this means but 😆
68,@300kilohertz All good points. Luck does seem to play a big roll.
69,I don’t expect much to come of my YouTube channel because right now I don’t have much to offer in terms of information. I’m still learning how to even produce videos let alone edit and use audio recording devices effectively.
70,@MackPhotoNZ So glad it’s not just me!
71,@nate_levine 😆 glad I’m not alone with this feeling.
72,Anyone else ever feel like tweeting and social media in general is speaking into the void and hoping someone else out there in the darkness deems you worthwhile to acknowledge or respond to?
73,"First YouTube video in a while. Got some practice in with the new gimbal and identified some weaknesses I need to work on. 

Gimbal Practice with Stephanie and her Instax Mini Evo https://t.co/YAsSytX0j5 via @YouTube"
74,Excellent work available here. https://t.co/T7z1gfsWgD
75,You never realize how loudly you breath until you record your own audio for the first time 😂 😤
76,Yup. Adds up quick too. https://t.co/uNDewiJJBJ
77,@analogfusion @FujifilmX_US I do too. Thanks for sharing your experience.
78,@ChrisBPhoto The xpro3 is an awesome tool. I love how it nudges you to be consistent and use the viewfinder instead of the screen. Combine the xpro3 with a 23mm f2 and 35mm f2 and you’re covered for anything family wise short of sports or something like that.
79,@themattrebell Me! I end up playing them for a few hours after purchase but recently I haven’t been able to finish any games.
80,@analogfusion Got it. I recently deleted my website and plan to start completely over soon. I’ve got tons of gear I’ve owned for long time so I’ve got a lot of relevant information to share. Especially about @FujifilmX_US cameras and lenses.
81,@jaimedelpizz0 Me too. My soul ‘bout left my body right there.
82,"@analogfusion Thanks, I appreciate that input. There are only a few channels that I watch purely for fun of it myself."
83,I guess I shouldn’t be looking for external validation and I should find joy in creating work that I love. It’s just a little difficult to keep that motivation going sometimes. 4/4
84,Clearly I’m doing something wrong and I don’t know what. I guess it might just be me. I’m constantly told by those around me that I’m a great photographer but when you’re not getting recognized by those you look up to it’s kind of hard to accept the compliments. 3/4
85,"My goal isn’t to have a social media following but to be respected by my peers and those in my industry. For instance, I’ve been trying to get my work shared/noticed by @FujifilmX_US since 2016 and I guess I must be doing something very wrong or my work is inadequate. Dunno 🤔2/4"
86,"I read that to earn a social media following you must establish yourself as an expert in your field. How do you do that? 
I don’t think posting “quality content” is enough anymore. Because if it is then I’ve got to face the facts that I must not be producing quality content. 1/4"
87,The silence is deafening
88,Just a heads up. I don’t play the follow/unfollow game. If I follow you for awhile it’s because I wanted to gauge the type of person you are. If I unfollow you it’s because I didn’t like what I found. Simple as that. I’m not trying to “game” the system or anything.
89,@jaimedelpizz0 Not a dream btw actually happened Friday.
90,@jaimedelpizz0 I tripped and caught myself on a shelf that was holding almost all my gear. The shelf gave out a bit dipped down and stuff started sliding toward the edge but luckily nothing fell! 😅 😮‍💨
91,@jaimedelpizz0 Yes. They are hard. Especially for someone like myself that’s constantly rethinking every single conversation I’ve ever had. 😅
92,"I’m toying with the idea of taking my YouTube channel much more seriously.

What kind of videos would you want to see?

Keep in mind I’m new to video creation and YouTube. 

I’m a huge @FujifilmX_US fan so know that any content regarding those cameras will be biased. 😆"
93,@benjhaisch @cleversupplyco @FujifilmX_US @moment Awesome!
94,@benjhaisch @cleversupplyco @FujifilmX_US @moment The x100v is such a little beast of a camera. You should also give an xpro3 a go sometime!
95,@OliverOsuna @FujifilmX_US I used the 35mm f2 lens for these shots. Auto focus was set to continuous single point and I used the 11 fps burst mode. I also used the optical viewfinder for most of these images. When using lenses longer than the 35 I use the evf.
96,"Well. Now I’ve got a good gimbal, a good camera for video and a set of rode wireless go 2 mics. Pretty excited to dive head first into taking video seriously. 

I’ve never enjoyed making video. I’m thinking that might be because I’ve never had quality tools. Changed that today."
97,@fredeschindler This pic gave me flashback to resident evil 8. If you know you know.
98,Just wanna thank all 255 of you who decided I was worth a little bit of your time. Thank you so much.
99,@zigmarillion 😂 excellent tweet sir
