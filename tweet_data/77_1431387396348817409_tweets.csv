1,@TheShamdoo RIP my mutant cats
2,@TripawdCrypto @coolcatsnft many were purchased for double the amount they were sold for.
3,One account just sold 35 @coolcatsnft For 6 eth massively below the previous floor I really hope it wasn't someone in the current ongoing conflict who was in panic for funds. God speed.
4,Trading in panic is the worst thing you can do it can wipe away months of gains. Be careful but make sure you are trading with your brain not your heart. It's your decision alone to decide your risk tolerance.
5,My heart goes out to all our friends worldwide putting our jpegs aside to focus on more important matters stay safe friends

27,@AbsoluteSaltETH @NFTrepzy i thought i was special...
28,@BentoBoiNFT Because they still sell out and go up in value. The space as a whole needs to be more selective when looking at smart contracts. Broken contracts should not be this common.

37,Well twitter scared me so bad I made a BRAND NEW account on my ledger and moved all my ETH to a wallet that has never connected to anything
38,This is why I have a hardware wallet where I literally do nothing with it except hold ETH and NFTs
39,Just got on this exploit sounds crazy are people losing just NFTs or ETH too?

53,@PopeyesNFTs very similar story here its wild
54,@PopeyesNFTs Really do be coming into Nfts with .5 eth
55,Why bother doing a Dutch Auction if you just pause the mint when it gets to a point where you don't like the price. Hella greed coming out.
56,@i_am_buddy one for 1 and the other for 2 yeah i misclicked doesnt matter what i sold at trying to help people haha
57,In an attempt to help people who are paying more for commons than rares on the tasty bone reveal the rarity is literally in the name of the revealed NFTs funny is the most common tier with meaty being uncommon and speedy being rare https://t.co/MyVIFfWhee
58,@RossRadford1 3 days ago
59,@RossRadford1 0.069 if you had WL
60,Love the art btw not saying this isnt worth 5 to 10 eth just noticing people are buying revealed commons for more than unrevealed rares seemingly because of lack of knowledge
61,@prancoisback makes no sense to go 4x floor on a common when theres plenty of rares listed for cheaper
62,Some of these revealed tasty bones are the most common shit going for like 5 to 10 eth. Noobs with to much money not knowing about the rarity % not being correct?
63,Bro i made it to 0 Meters left on the new @KaijuKingz took my hands of the keyboard cause i thought i was finally done. I wasnt.
64,Whoever that was that bought 50 eth worth of $Milk for .02 before the announcement was made is fucking up HUGE
65,NFT's are exhausting make sure you stay happy and healthy friends. This space is full of endless possibilities but you need to be here for it. Stay safe and take care ♥️ gn
