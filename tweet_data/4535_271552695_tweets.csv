27,"@filos Depends on the project. Will buy floor with the aim to flip, will buy rare with the aim to hold."
28,"I know floor price doesn't matter, but it is just crazy to see how thin the @RumbleKongs floor is.

44 kongs under 3eth 
197 kongs under 5eth
450 kongs under 10eth

Current floor price: 1.9eth

The floor is the definition of lava. The time to buy is now."

44,"@xicotwoo @wenweb4 Or.... now hear me out here. Maybe, just maybe, people like the art and it's not all about the money? And also it is a great opportunity to help out smaller artists."
45,"@offwhitegoku @wenweb4 What I don't get is what effect it has on you that others are buying into a derivative project? If you don't like them, look the other way. Simple as that."

78,@CryptoWorldMars @0xApes_NFT I spot my beautiful ape
79,@itstylersays Why so salty? What happened to WAGMI?
80,@Rudluv @0xApes_NFT Derivative project to BAYC. Epic community and a great way for those priced out of BAYC to own an ape. Give this a read: https://t.co/bfQP2KhgSa
81,"Before I got into NFTs, everyone I asked who was in the space said that community was their favorite part.

@0xApes_NFT has an incredible community 🔥

If you don't like it, look the other way, or get off that high horse and just come vibe in Discord! 

Stop being anti-WAGMI 🙏"
82,"@sickpencil @jewla8 Take a look at this. I was skeptical before, but actually an epic community and just gives a chance to those priced out of BAYC. https://t.co/bfQP2KhgSa"
83,@cozyflexing @ChengJia890123 @0xApes_NFT It’s crazy. I’ve gained close to 200 0xApes today. This community is insane 📈
84,@VictoryCrypto1 @0xApes_NFT #3D gang @therealwillhdz
85,@therealwillhdz @natac131 @0xApes_NFT Did someone say 3D gang?
86,@itsyaboyguccii I’m making my way there through other means. Kinda love my 0xape now so will probs hold him
87,"@itsyaboyguccii Without a doubt, the right-click-save brigade are the ones who are wearing the fake rolex and jordans claiming to be real. Not about that. Rather own something legit and be a part of a community"
88,The @0xApes_NFT support from the community is unrivaled 📈 https://t.co/4CxfgJf9vz
89,@itsyaboyguccii Exactly. As long as 0xApes stay true to themselves and the community and don't claim to be or own a BAYC then there shouldn't be a problem. Community and artwork is what did it for me
90,"@Jawn_Wick23 @VapourFriend Hahah, supporting the @0xApes_NFT  rn, will return to my @RumbleKongs pfp soon enough. RKL has and will always my first love"
91,"@Jawn_Wick23 @VapourFriend Yeh exactly, that's totally fair! I have a good collection of new NFTs, and I've always loved the BAYC artwork so that's why I bought in."
92,"@Jawn_Wick23 @VapourFriend 0xApes was delisted from OS, but then relisted after they realised there was no copy infringement. This article outlines everything: https://t.co/bfQP2KhgSa"
93,"@Jawn_Wick23 @VapourFriend I thought this, but now I see the 'derivative market' as something similar to real-life, and potentially very profitable:

BAYC, Cool Cats, etc = Original Mona Lisa

Derivative BAYC, Cool Cats, etc = The posters of the Mona Lisa that can be bought for a fraction of the price"
94,@TheRealALoch @VapourFriend It's a good entry for people who love the BAYC art but missed the boat. Will obviously never rival BAYC but its cool for new people to the space to own an ape
95,"This is what @0xApes_NFT is all about. 

Different tribe, same bloodline 

#BAYC 🤝 #0xApes https://t.co/TAmsu8nezo"
96,@Jesse77240833 @0xApes_NFT 👀👀
97,"@VapourFriend Yeh totally fair man, I was also skeptical but it was the community for me. And the fact that BAYC holders were supporting it was cool to see. Idk, only time will tell"
98,"@VapourFriend And the yellow background is to signify that they are not BAYC, and won't ever be BAYC"
99,"@VapourFriend Same traits but they have been designed so that no 0xApe is the same as any BAYC, all are completely unique.

The tagline is ""different tribe, same bloodline"".

I see it as a cool way for those who missed out on BAYC to own similar art and be part of an awesome community."
