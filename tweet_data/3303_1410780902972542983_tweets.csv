9,@DesLucrece Much appreciated!! Proud supporter and stoked to see your vision continue to unfold
10,"Such nostalgia opening one of @DesLucrece Monster Icon Packs... Raffled out to ETH Monsters; this project keeps on rewarding supporters. Have a feeling the ride is just beginning 👀🔥

My new 1/1 has me feeling particularly trippy 💚 https://t.co/eHfekFFc6G"

Team consistently delivers and roadmap should inspire tons of confidence that things are undervalued! 📈💸"
15,@DesLucrece Huge congratulations!! Building something special here...
16,@the_good_knight Pretty certain that’s fake
17,@machupichu888 @missingfrontier Bought back when watchers weren’t selling out. Sadly I’ve fumbled many of my assets along the way—still have a nice bag though!

Big thanks to @serpin_taxt, and GL to those angling to join the MonsterHub at the auction 01/27. I may still be in the market 👀 https://t.co/SjAR3beqSR"
23,@rippyfied Your PFP is glorious.
24,"Silver lining, perhaps every conversation can stop being about floor prices?"
25,"The best opportunities arise amid downturns. 

Ethereum isn't providing a less inspiring future at this discount. Stay patient, engaged, and invest incrementally. WGMI."
26,"@pMauz_crypto @coolcatsnft Forbidden Fruit

Travel to Clon’s favorite 🌳 . The tree, though very large, sparingly bears fruit. The trip is long and arduous with a chance you invest a lot of effort for no reward.

Reward: RNG Random (Seasonal Fruit) or Nothing

28,@goodknight_eth Was bullish on the sentiment behind Twitter Verification but man did they disappoint on execution... How does a hexagonal crop incentivize new entrants
29,...I can't be the only one who finds the @TwitterBlue NFT Profile Picture super underwhelming?
30,"@nosleepjon @DennisonBertram @nosleepjon helped me out, but by no means is this straightforward. Understand you don't want account proliferation but there's serious tradeoffs."
31,@goodknight_eth @MetaHero_ @alexisohanian @pixelvault_ @cloncast and @Gfunkera86 have assembled some top shelf teams
32,"Casual sweep of 13 @MetaHero_  by @alexisohanian for 85 ETH.

4,500 $POW per month * 13 Heroes * $0.25 current price = $14,625 (4.5 ETH) per month or a payback period of 19 months at current prices.

@pixelvault_ is delivering 🔥📈"
33,Especially good time to sit tight on NFTs. High gas &gt; presumed illiquidity &gt; undercutting. Shelter in place and ride out the high-rates induced storm.

35,@MutantShibaClub 👀👀
36,"Conviction through the dip. What I've been buying the past few days:

1. @coolcatsnft - Pets, $MILK, agnostic gaming infra
2. @missingfrontier - @Ubisoft partnership, $DATA
3. $BTRFLY - @OlympusDAO sub-DAO, @CurveFinance liquidity wars
4. @RugRadio - decentralized media platform"

48,@NFTsnaakye Same. Wondering if this could be malicious in any way... I'd ignore it for the time being and not interact with the NFT.
49,@649Speedy That floor Classy 2 is free money
50,"Buy when there’s blood in the streets. This move down is temporary, we’ll bounce right back. 

Not not financial advice. 💰"
51,"Impossible to watch @missingfrontier previews and not get stoked on what's to come.

Only 18 $DATA Keys for sale, floor is thin if you want to own a piece of this P2E gaming ecosystem... Might've picked up another key as I wrote this 🙃 https://t.co/wdheGO55Ho"

82,@Fitchinverse @Fitchinverse let’s connect on this. Have a team already working towards something similar.
83,@elliotrades @ParallelNFT and @missingfrontier are the primary gaming blue chips I’m holding. @coolcatsnft may very well recategorize over depending on how their roadmap shapes up.
84,"@YOKOMSON @SBF_FTX Two things:
(1) Blue chips are in part established bc of provenance and legacy, no alt side chain or rollup offers that prestige right now

(2) Long tail projects may exist on other chains but you're compounding your risk IMO"
85,@YOKOMSON @SBF_FTX Don't expect any sidechain NFT projects to survive long term.

88,"@YourFinanc3 @coolcatsnft @robotosNFT @Deadfellaznft @creatureNFT @doodles @fvckrenderverse @LazyLionsNFT Good list. That said, @MetaHero_ deserves a spot over a few of these."
89,"@0xS1MN @MetaHero_ @0n1Force @creatureNFT Gut feel that I'll be in the minority, but I can't help but feel @pixelvault_ /@MetaHero_ are heavily oversold. At this price point it's hard to say anything other than MetaHero, esp given all the associated drops."
90,"@YourFinanc3 @fvckrenderverse @fvckrender Hodler of 2 myself, artwork is ridiculous"
