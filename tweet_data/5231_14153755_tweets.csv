35,"@biglesp Yes, for a brief period we considered ditching the plan to buy in London. Instead we looked at a guest house in middle of nowhere. Cheaper, and had a revenue income. Only down side was that we know nothing about the industry. Nothing at all."
36,"@mutzumstrich I know, interesting thought experiment isn't it. What would you do now, if in the same position. The choices are expanding all the time."
37,"@biglesp Totally, I've pivoted a few times, from 3d animator, to UX, to product mgt, to strategy, to co-founder. All with an undercurrent of development. I once nearly started a hotel (thats a convo to have over beers)."
38,In my late teens I spend a lot of time gaming and learning 3D modeling and animation. I had my sight on working in TV special effects (which I achieved!) But would I have gone down that route if I could have made a living building assets for the Metaverse from home?

We run KYC due the nature of the Learn to Earn platform, but the protocol itself is user agnostic. White paper is coming soon."
55,"@metaesther42 I'd argue that the seeds of Web3 have been around since the beginning of the internet. A decentralised world in which people could build communities, live, learn, love and trade. It's just taken a while to get here."
56,"@cloudsonpluto @mave99a @marygooneratne Good question. In our case we also provide the courses and assessments, so can verify (on-chain) a course pass  before putting the achievement data on-chain. Giving us a transparent audit log connecting course provider / learner with achievement."
57,"@marygooneratne Makes total sense for you records of achievements to be owned by the individual, and on-chain. We are building a platform to enable exactly that."
58,"@mave99a @marygooneratne Replacing CV's with a on-chain record of achievement is exactly what we are building. Initially tied to our own leaning content, but with aim to open up the platform."
