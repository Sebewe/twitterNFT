18,"@LTCFAN1 @_georgejd @EB4Three @0xBender @LooksRareNFT OS literally has no token and gives $0 rewards back to users. This is what the Web3 community has been begging for. Building good tech takes time, @LooksRareNFT has already been shipping updates so the the UX parity will come. Think longer term and remember what y’all wished for."

35,"@LooksRareNFT @ZoddLooksRare NOTE some may be repetitive...
- More data (trait counts, rarity %'s, etc.)
- Notifications (heard looking into this)
- Dark / Light mode
- Use more buttons (hovers confuses less savvy users)
- Incorporate user rewards into profiles
- Add estimated rewards during buy/sell flow"

97,"@arioinvesting @dwl2300 @AggerFPL @WSBChairman @Investingcom Yes understand their business model. If they now have $3B more in capital to de-risk their own model, why continue to limit buy orders for your customers? Yes others got caught but some are changing. https://t.co/opkE177ZVA"
98,"@arioinvesting @dwl2300 @AggerFPL @WSBChairman @Investingcom Still don’t buy that’s the sole reason. They’ve removed margin trading, limited instant deposit availability, increased their capital position by $3B while STILL limiting buy orders. All roads lead to someone covering a serious fuck up."
