10,@HawthornFC Would really love if someone could contact me in regards to the 3 match worn indigenous guernseys I won at auction back in May. I’ve been calling you guys every month to get an update and was told a few weeks ago that it was being shipped that day. Still nothing.

29,@Pudgy_Penguins ooo I like the sound of this my little pudgy degens
30,"@oldmanroshii Can’t disagree but can’t write them off either. They’ve built a lot, and I think the more devs and users realise what is capable on @zilliqa, the more price will grow. No reason why they can’t do what ADA has done in terms of marketcap"
31,@oldmanroshii Maybe for this cycle.. we’ll see.
32,@oldmanroshii What’s funny mate
33,@MattZilliqa @ZilSwap @SpardaWallet Where can I find them mate? Nothing on Sparda under the contract provided..

59,@adiazfunes @PatriciaViennet Agreed volume is a concern. Not sure where it’s coming from. Hopefully people new getting into the space during the parabolic stages will opt for the ‘cheaper’ blockchain projects. 😏
60,"@DrhoujYounss @ChocoBoyZil Appreciate your thoughts.. why is it impossible? It’s only around ~$20b market cap, which would place it somewhere in the top 20 at current standings. If the total crypto mc rises during this last leg of the bullrun, $20b or 14x from here could easily happen imo"
61,"@adiazfunes @PatriciaViennet Thanks for your input mate, why don’t you think it’s realistic?"
62,A little bit of hopium for all the $Zil fam in my feed. Frustrating ride so far as we watch other coins pump but can see this playing out. This is my top of the bullrun target for #zilliqa Call me crazy or conservative? https://t.co/CKqlbGaMc3

73,This’ll be nuts. Another step towards more adoption on the @zilliqa blockchain. Will be nice to spend cents rather than hundreds of dollars in gas fees. #zil #eth https://t.co/EuIOOIg8H5
