1,@AdamDogeNorris Love the hustle! Congratulations! Hopefully I can get there one day.
2,@steveb_crypto Agreed! I was more just focused on daily users. This goes WAY up when you consider monthly users! Thanks for the input.
3,RT @BV_nft: Happening tomorrow 🗣🗣 all flower holders will be eligible to claim a free shirt for every flower they hold on said wallet!! LFG…
4,@wilxlee You are amazing. Take care of your family and yourself! It’s a shame how people are in this space as they want everything NOW and jump to next shiny object. There are plenty of projects and creators like yourself that are working hard to make things happen.
5,@hex_nft @AngelsDevilsNFT I think you need a few more!
6,@0xwinky What's dumb is a I have a second twitter account I created about 2 months ago  for some basic non NFT things and I have that. However this account that I have twitter blue and I have had for over 15 years does not have it! lol. It's supposed to help with the algo of what you see
7,Loving this space. Just helps me showcase the @nftworldsNFT is not just for games but learning can be BIG piece. https://t.co/N1HRltDg1i

9,In a space and I saw @ajgreer_10 listening to the @AngelsDevilsNFT. I can only guess which side he will pick!
10,@BillianosW @doodles Congrats!
11,@kevwuzy Pretty sure Kevin Rose held that title lol! However looks like you are not far behind.
12,@k48___ @steven__rea @BV_nft What is a Kevin??? I missed something! Lol
13,Yet ANOTHER use case to add to my @nftworldsNFT thread! Amazing! https://t.co/RzeB9tEEY9
14,"13/ @angryboars @HeroGalaxyNFT  @grayboysdao  @skuxxverse @whitesandsgame  @AngelsDevilsNFT These are all early and trying to kick off the movement into the metaverse and want to go along with them. 

Sorry for the long rant! See you in the #Metaverses"
15,12/ I know a lot of the numbers in the above thread of guesses and in no way any financial advice. However studying the market and trends and trying to be early helps. All this above is just my Opinion and why I am betting on the following so far.
16,11/ This is why I am trying to buy in early to projects that have teams who can build a community and their projects plus have a vision. Will all the projects in @nftworldsNFT make it? Nope. However the platform is a great starting point to capture these gamers hearts!
17,10/ One step further and we can say well only 10% of these games will be captive GREAT and take about 70% of the good volume and now instead of 800 daily users per server we might end up with servers with 5k plus users in 300 of these worlds.
18,"9/ We are now around 500 active daily users per server. Not great but not bad. Let's go one step further. Maybe only half of these worlds will have a good game and  team building it. So these 3,000 server how then have 80% of the 3million users and now we are at 800 daily users"
19,"8/ Let's take a guess that that maybe 2,500 are held just so users can stake earn $Wrld and own a piece of it. Maybe another 1,500 for non game experiences like owning land, hang outs or even education (this could be whole other thread!). We are now down to about 6,000"
20,7/ These 1.5million daily users may want to rewarded for their time and also have the ability to move game assets from one game to another instead of leaving in just one game forever. We also need to consider that not all 10k worlds will be used for games.
21,6/ However if you just captured part of the #Minecraft market let's say 10% = 350k players and then maybe 4% of the #Steam players = 2.4million we are now looking at close to 3million possible players
22,5/ You can also compare to a game service like @Steam because they house a Varity of games from Indie games to AAA experiences.  per https://t.co/MQC7T5x3ls there are close to 60million users a day. I don't think you can capture the entire market that would be silly.
23,4/ You compare to the number of daily users in Minecraft. So I went to https://t.co/FDZ21WBHmF and I can see it's around 3.5 million while I am typing this. That is already 6x what #Wow  has. https://t.co/gEeU0iJDtj
24,3/ #nftworlds will be more than just one game type. What's amazing about  NFT worlds and some of the things I have seen being built is they are all different game types or some are just experiences.  IMO you can compare NFT worlds numbers 1 of two ways.
25,"2/ I don't think you can compare @nftworldsNFT to only one game and game type. WOW is a #MMORPG and one game with around 500k users per day or 5million users per month. These are great numbers and when compared to 10,000 #nftworlds  you only get 50 users per day or 500 per month"
26,"1/ I saw a tweet where someone was comparing the number for @nftworldsNFT compared to WOW servers. Saying there are only 200 plus WOW servers and 10,000 worlds, trying to make a case that only a few people would be playing on each server."
27,a quick 🧵about @nftworldsNFT  and why I don't believe that they will be oversaturated in the number of worlds available for #P2E
28,@steven__rea @BV_nft And somehow you kill it everyday.
