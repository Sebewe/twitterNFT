2,@HChipNFT Looking forward to it
3,"@HChipNFT Yes!!
Now that I am almost a full time artist I am very excited to get in on this"
4,@LiamMurphyAstro Yeah I had my fun bouncing around last year. Time for some big projects that blow up my laptop😅
5,@LiamMurphyAstro Yeah I'm hoping the same. Just bought a 135mm f2 that I'm curious to use. Also plans for a big panorama of the core at some point
6,"@Uzzi_fx https://t.co/QOfVljI8c2
You're not following me but I just wanted to show off all the awesome art I've been able to buy"
7,@NudeYogaGirl @robnessofficial Does it feel powerful?
8,@HChipNFT @AndrewHookerPh1 High praise from a great person in the space
9,@HChipNFT Loving the updates. Really excited to see how the team progresses for the year. It's inspiring me to make sure I don't fall behind

15,@AlphaTrilogy @NiftyMetaGirl @blakerandall81 The one I sniped from you by @tristan_todd was taken in the same area. That's now the 3rd Yukon landscape shot that I own

27,What else is there to say about the Yukon. I just saw @AlphaTrilogy highlight this collection from @blakerandall81 and I had to buy this one from the Tombstone Mountain range. Just an epic shot. I don't know what else to say https://t.co/xtwif8tVeV
28,@AlphaTrilogy @blakerandall81 @sloikaxyz Blake's work is absolutely incredible
29,@declanrmc Hope you enjoy all this rain 😂

This one talks a bit about scarcity"
34,"@wolfmercury @ununkx @vincentschnabl https://t.co/xJiFEMzSZI
There is this one about building a fan base of true fans"
35,@wolfmercury @ununkx @vincentschnabl I call bullshit on scarcity. Andy Warhol released 11k pieces of art and he is incredibly well known. How do you expect to build a collector base if only 10 people know about you. Lemme find some links for you to read

47,@HChipNFT I like this idea. I'm going to do that
48,@HChipNFT Actually scrap that. I have exceeded it by 7k

62,@RonanHunt88 Yeah I'm probably going to shoot something similar now😂
63,@CosmosAstroArt What target is this? It's looking juicy
64,I love the southern sky. Even if it is a pain to polar align😂 https://t.co/ad3qz4YM2c
65,@Astro__Che Dude! This is sick.
66,@umagumag_ Thank you fren🤗
67,@graham_what I was drawn to this shot the moment I saw it. Just a fantastic moment captured and this is also my latest piece purchased. Hope you enjoyed reading https://t.co/6Kmyxypdk6
68,@astromarkc1 Space is awesome. I really enjoy Mark's art and seeing him improve in what is an extremely challenging genre of photography https://t.co/IqCm73TSha
69,@James_MPhoto What else is there to say about this shot but WOW!!! Peyto lake is stunning during the day let alone seeing it with the aurora dancing above https://t.co/L5aFn5f2dy
70,@lance_wilson_ I love this shot from Lance. I really enjoy how the light trails get covered by the fog. Adds a sense of mystery to the photo https://t.co/YolqTYDCZq
71,@jsaragossaNFT I love how even photographing smoke can create such a beautiful abstract piece of art. https://t.co/DoUlanzrHj
72,@sarahlyndsay_ makes appearance no.3. I love the landscape here and the pose of the dress really helps with the drama of the sky. https://t.co/tI43hP4UUx
73,@tristan_todd_ makes another appearance. This shot is just incredible. The drama of the atmosphere really gets me going. The story of this Yukon trip is exhilarating https://t.co/qCctTxqcSU
74,@dyptre I love this shot. The trunk really leads your eye into the image and gives depth. For a messy scene it's well composed. Love the shutter speed for the water too https://t.co/39LnTHiuuO
75,"@LokiHighlock This is such an intriguing shot. The lilly isolated by everything else with the light, really draws your eye in. I like the editing done on this one. Initially I thought it was done under the moon light but is in fact sunlight. https://t.co/mmr4kLTkf2"
76,@Matdphoto What else is there to say about this epic NZ landscape? The light on top of the mountain in the background is *chefs kiss https://t.co/CuaIBPLhKg
77,@russimages Lampman is iconic. Such an incredible self portrait series from Russ. It's unique and it also makes me laugh when I look at it. I hope lampman's date went well. https://t.co/h7rfQZGIXk
78,@avinashpc6 I mentioned it last week but I'll say it again this is such a fantastic shot. I love all the detail captured in the eyes of this dragonfly. https://t.co/eOjmuyByOH
79,@justjuliasky This might be my favourite shot in my whole collection. The eeriness of the whole photo is perfect. The graffiti on the statue is the cherry on top. I love the idea of exploring abandoned themeparks. I can still hear the laughter of children roaming it. https://t.co/6ciWO3JCI1
80,@sbedaux I asked one night for a photo that would make me utter the words what the fuck. This shot of a drunken luchador did just that. It's another shot that unsettles me in a good way and I like art that challenges me https://t.co/bNekUA1hH8
81,@cabionur A great street photography shot that really unsettles me in a good way. The combination of the face paint which gives off a creepy vibe and then the rose appears as a gift to draw you in. I'm really not sure what will happen if I take it. Get's my imagination going. https://t.co/G5Kd5YW6Zm
82,@ShutterCapital This jelly fish shot is so eerie yet beautiful at the same time. I saw this on the OS trending page and it really captivated me. I never considered jellyfish to be photogenic but I was proven wrong. https://t.co/8TaGxSLRKh
83,"@EBleicher There is a reason why Eric has appeared again. I love the shape of this aurora and the no foreground. It allows me to just fully immerse myself into it and as the title of the piece suggests.

Breathe. https://t.co/IUX6XLRlke"
84,@sarahlyndsay_ Another shot From Sarah that is so epic and moody. Big fan of the long exposure of the clouds. https://t.co/0fzAnYs6Ik
85,@sarahlyndsay_ I've been following Sarah and her self portrait work on instagram for a long time. I love the background in this. The painted rocks give the photo so much to look at. https://t.co/qc5GAWEBDM
86,@Prasanthdasds I love the ferocity in the eyes of this Cheetah. I can just feel it staring into my soul. That post feeding look really shows the brutality of the wild. https://t.co/ugwAcA4rNU
87,"@vastdepth I like trees, I like the milky-way. I couoldn't not add this to my collection. I really love how Venus is cradled in the tree. Great framing. Another thing that I like is the time it has been shot. Nautical Twilight. Very rare to see that from astro photographers. https://t.co/XV1AielcmK"
88,"@hauglandphoto Another beautiful scene. The water looks so inviting, the sun beaming through the trees. It truly gives the feeling of life. Ole showed me what this spot looks like in Winter. I'll take Spring every day https://t.co/nRdPcmeEBd"
89,@tristan_todd_ Tristan might be more known for his rainforest work but his backcountry landscape shots are a sight to behold. I love this one. A landscape very alien to me and so dramatic. This won't be the only inclusion of the Yukon https://t.co/6CiV1qK1r0
90,@DocCraftAlot It's a very dreamy and calm looking photo. Very ethereal. https://t.co/mMzEnEOxWs
91,@debc_nz I've tried making interesting sand shots myself and can never really pull it off. Kudos to Deb for pulling that off here. I have fun following the curves in the sand to draw my eye around the frame https://t.co/F0GQrSBWIP
92,@AmberArtStudio As I stated last week I was drawn to the cause of helping save these giant trees but I also love the juxtaposition of the sapling and the mature tree. It's almost like a glimpse into the future https://t.co/aBPN0o0uep
93,"@CodyBakerrrr This shot has it all. Burner sky, epic foreground, impressive mountains. It's a landscape photographers wet dream. I've got a real soft spot for Canada as well. https://t.co/NB7OejQoR7"
94,@realflyingkiwi This shot reminded me of my Fiancee. Her favourite animal being an Orca. I had to add this into my collection. It's a unique shot as well. Don't see too many Orca shots from this angle. https://t.co/XdVUU3guTW
95,@luke_lens The atmosphere in this shot I love. The falling snow being caught in the street light. The desolate and lonely feeling I get from an empty street. It's just a really beautiful shot. https://t.co/o4YKXNIj7D
96,"@AndrewHookerPh1 I love this shot from Andrew. As I said to him when I first bought this piece, It made me think of a prehistoric Australia, when megafauna roamed. It really got my imagination going. https://t.co/tIh3hfilS4"
97,"@EBleicher What drew me to this piece was not only the beautiful aurora but the title.

Hope. 

It's a powerful force in this world and has kept me going especially in the early days. Eric is a magician with caption writing and harnessing his thoughts to draw you in. https://t.co/4VkYPrbCwz"
