0,@holyn How web3 fulfills on the promise of web1. The designers of the original internet built some decentralized architecture and intended there to be a payment layer (see 402 Error in HTTP). Web2 diverted but now web3 realizes the vision of web-native payments and value capture.

5,"Web3 can be intimidating, but the future will be a mix of native startups with existing players. You can be a leader by starting the transition into web2.5 today.

We're here to help with strategy/marketing at @serotonin_hq and offer marketplace infrastructure at @mojito_nft. 💫"
6,"For more thoughts on the web2.5 and the best ways to enter the space, check out my episode of the @Digiday podcast with @KayleighJBarber.

7,"Companies should consider aligning with web3 influencers like @gmoneyNFT and web3 communities like @BoredApeYC that are well known, but also newer communities like @crypto_coven @Poolsuite etc."
8,One easy way for companies to dip their toe in web2.5 is buying their @ensdomains and updating their Twitter name. This is augmentative to the existing community insofar as it helps grow the $ENS ecosystem.
9,"They shouldn't say ""WAGMI"" or ""gm"" until they plan a web2.5 strategy that is augmentative to the existing web3 community. That is inauthentic. In the web2.5 world, companies need to figure out how to align economically with their community, instead of seeing them as ""consumers""."
10,"Companies will succeed in web2.5 if they translate the DNA of what makes them valuable into a web3 context. This requires taking a real interest in web3.

The hallmark of a high-quality web2.5 strategy is strengthening the existing web3 community rather than diverting resources."
11,"What is the web2.5?

First, many of the best known crypto companies do not have fully web3 business models. Centralized exchanges, for example, have existed for centuries.

Traditional and web2 companies won't transform overnight. They need to test the market and learn."

45,"@jonatkinson11 Florence was the seat of much of the defining culture, science, technology creation driving the Renaissance, perhaps the most exciting place to be in its time. Web3 is a similarly powerful space of creation and innovation that may define our historical moment."
