If that were the case then he wouldn't practise anything  on the training pitch because you cant replicate playing in front of a crowd

You practise pens to get the technique right surely no!?"

I just wonder if small print is enough in this instance.
Hopefully those 2 sales are the only sales🙏and we have true take off! 🚀🚀🚀"
13,"@Degentraland @doodles @evankeast @poopie @burnttoast Mainly re redistribution of perceived rarities that could impact some ppl harder than others

Also I think ""your Space Doodle is your Doodle"" was a line that could've been repeated ad infinitum, everywhere and on every occasion, especially on the website

But they're grt though🥰"
14,"@Degentraland @doodles @evankeast @poopie @burnttoast Next level stuff!!

Couple of concerns for me I wont lie

But the set up from here on looks 🚀"
15,"@varounsvlogs Hey man
Thats actually the first time I've heard the exact words
""if you sell your ship, you sell your Doodle""
That might be something put on the website front right and centre

17,"@ohhshiny Theres 2 Mk4s already in the 37 Space Doodles, so its prob not too rare"
18,"@Nittyb_xyz So has the ship become the most important thing now determining 'value'? 
Are Doodles traits out of the equation? 

And its 4am! 😂"
19,@ohhshiny I wonder why the Doodles in the ships are still listed in the Doodles OS page? I thought they were 2 different collections
20,@Nittyb_xyz Theres no way Burnt Toast hasnt been working on these from day dot 🥰

25,"@DarkPenciI @doodles Indeed, just need a couple a projects to be the ones, they're the genesis, but others can take part 💪"
26,"@DarkPenciI @doodles Tbh its the way I figure Cats might go too if Cooltopia works out, that you can do quests and earn $milk with your Ape or your Doodle eg. I think Littles were already in the mix to earn $milk. Ultimately the more participants in an ecosystem, the better for the ecosystem"
27,"@Nittyb_xyz Absolutely, I dont think they'll go crazy for irl rank effects. Would be at the mercy of world events, not to mention just inconvenience.

Perks, for sure. But not to effect our ranks I dont think"
28,@dylanorrelI I just cant see theyll go overboard with irl stuff because distribution is worldwide
29,"Imagine that Space @doodles becomes an epic gamified world. And imagine if the next move is that Doodles drop unmanned spaceships, that you can wrap your other NFTs in."
30,"@TrainerLuisCR I can imagine, rather than a true companion, they drop another collection that adds to the Doodle world (I dunno, un-manned Drones or something) so that ppl can take part who don't own Doodles. That could really grow the ecosystem."
31,@Degentraland Do we think these ships are ripe to be able to spend a Doodle token on?
32,@Nittyb_xyz Do you think they'll realistically 'geo-lock' benefits? Not all holders are in the US after all

52,"@LDNcards I rewatched and Schulz had another bvb player in his way, so the ideal pass might not have realistically been on. 

It's inherently a good sign that Bellingham is frustrated. He wants things to be better. But I'd hope he grows out of this sort of tantrum-y behavior."
53,@clegainz @nbatopshot *TS is an incredible project. But maybe ppl expectations of long-term values needs to be reassessed.
54,"@clegainz @nbatopshot I'm concerned it wont pass because moment counts go up &amp; user numbers don't. So one of those metrics need to change. And moments aren't being burnt, so users need to go up. And I don't know where the next wave comes from."
55,"@clegainz @ima_sac @nbatopshot The community didn't ask for this structure.
The community regularly asked for the chance to hit rares in their packs.
The structure was chosen by Topshot."

(not to say its guaranteed to work out!)"
82,"@itsmechase I think there's a LOT of misunderstanding that IF is another Hape or Meka. It's nothing of the sort. The team behind them are here for the long term.

Do I think it's over-valued rn? Yeah I do.

99,@itstylersays Might be worth noting that end of Feb was always going to be a packed minting period with several anticipated projects launching. Might be that ppl liquidating to prep for them has precipitated these slippery floors.
