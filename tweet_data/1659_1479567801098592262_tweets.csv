3,@samjstudios Do you think there is any overlap between art and pfps or are they mutually exclusive?
4,"when two collectors (or not, up to 8!) agree to collaborate, a new NFT is created by dun for each collector - these are ""distractions"" or ""interferences"" in this imagined day - of which we (the community) are all a part

wow"
5,"The second work is owned (06/03) is in my collection.  Together, with another, we agree to collaborate - then dun's magic comes in.

4. It's still early in NFTs and in @opensea 's journey, so a lot can change as tech and market develops"
12,"Key takeaways :

1. The power of web3 networks is such that harming a small number of creators has impacts orders of magnitude higher than traditional marketplaces
2.  OpenSea presumably underestimated this, hence their reversal"
