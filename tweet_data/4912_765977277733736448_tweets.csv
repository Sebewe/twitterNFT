6,In case you missed the @Gamersenft AMA with @RoundtableDAO. You can find their #tokenomics score in the token vault on our website. All they need is the network effect. https://t.co/KjzlCDSuoU
7,I hope the $LOOKS team implements a stronger use case for their currency other than staking to get WETH. Natural demand is needed for the price to recover.
8,Some might look at the $LUNA chart over the last week and wonder why it's outperforming... #Tokenomics https://t.co/7NbNI2DiGz

11,"When you invest in a crypto currency with a decreasing supply, you now have a 66% chance of making money given all other variables are constant. Users grow, you win, users flat line, you win.  You double your odds. #tokenomics"
12,"@0xBaba23 @Treasure_DAO Visit our website and fill out the template as you think it should be. I’m curious to see what % you weight certain things. As stated in the report, you might weigh things differently. All that matters is you do the analysis 👍🏾"
13,"@0xBaba23 @Treasure_DAO Respectfully, I disagree. The only points deducted were it not being deflationary and the current circulating supply. The 15 points for high use case considers their multiple use cases."

The only question is: how many people will join the Treasure ecosystem?"
18,You will need the $MAGIC currency to use their ecosystem. It's the utility tokens for all of the different metaverses under its umbrella. This is an important difference from some of the game studios out there. https://t.co/cJKnQ8KGoR

The question is: do most people only use their ecosystem partners or do they use the services Cosmos provides?"

27,"@Cephii1 Tokenomics and network effect are the only things that matter. 
https://t.co/VoXcLceEev"
28,I'll add: look at their price chart over the last month. $LUNA holder couldn't care less about global wars. The users are sitting in stable coins anyway and the ones holding $LUNA are earning passive from those using the stable coins. Just solid fundamentals. I don't even own any
29,"You see a boom and bust of retail traders but an overall increase in network adoption. The question is: how large will their network effect get? 

Based on my analysis, the $LUNA currency could be used as a store of value given it obtains the necessary network effect."
30,They have an analytics page to see the inflationary/deflationary status of the $LUNA token. The design of their tokenomics structure is one of the best I've analyzed. Combine that with the number of users they have and the result you get is their price chart.
31,They have a few countries already on board. You need to burn the $LUNA currency to mint the stable coins. The transaction fees from using the stable coins on the network are paid to stakers in $LUNA tokens as a reward for validating transactions. https://t.co/bzocmPlX7O

37,"@Matt_Tremolada I love your analysis. That's exactly the level of consideration I hope everyone takes when investing in a currency. As I said, the deciding factor for me was the fact that I don't use it. If I participated in the ecosystem, the currency would be a better store of value for me"
38,"@Matt_Tremolada I'll note, if you use the project, the score is a 76.8 and should be a ""Do Your Own Research"". Not using a project is at least a 10% factor when it comes to investing in the currencies associated with them."
39,"@Matt_Tremolada Correct. But there is no way to know for sure if it will be deflationary. Once it has deflationary months, I'll redo the analysis. With transaction fees so low, it will be interesting to see how that plays out."
40,"The supply has no limit and will increase at 5% yearly. With an increasing supply long term, the question is: how many non-developers will need to buy the $GLMR currency to use moonbeam?
