1,"@TrapkingzG @joshbobrowsky @InvsbleFriends Curious what their plan is here.  Not saying you're wrong or right, but consensus is lower for most poorly executed pfps.  How can/will these people execute?"
2,@joshbobrowsky I don't really know if that is the market seems like a bit of an overexaggeration.   I do agree in the sense that HAPE dropped at like 10 and invisible friends were 12 and meebits are 2.5 right now.  LL project vs unknowns with very little organic community is just wild.
3,@joshbobrowsky I’d say up 10000x in a year is really quick. Punk and squiggle minted for gas and traded sideways for years. The craziest people have these things called 401ks and they only go up like 3% a year and people plow money into them to keep up with inflation. Scary world out there.
4,@JamesClear I think you underrate the idea that all of sensations come from neurons in the brain and so we can just put the brain in a vat and simulate the feeling of being an immortal t-rex and more or less actually become one. Even better we can eat whatever we want.

7,"@10kdiver High possibility I do not understand. Per the below wouldn't there be 2 states in a1 and a2=3?  Curious how it is only a1=1. Intuitively HT and TT are the same outcome, so I can't see how they have different probabilities.  Amazing thread, I am probably wrong can't see where. https://t.co/J56i22Gs3K"
8,@10kdiver How is this true if a1 = 2 and a2 = 3 or is this not the case?
9,@mpbb327 @proof_xyz I wish I had 27 eth just lying around.  Is there a discord for normies?
10,@KS10x9 @XCOPYART @alexisohanian @dmitricherniak @MattKaneArtist Does everyone think 15 is @beeple?
11,@KS10x9 @XCOPYART @alexisohanian @dmitricherniak I think 5 is @MattKaneArtist looks a lot like his AB piece
12,@mpbb327 @proof_xyz So many people buying I hope it’s for the art. Would love to get a community around it with the artist this is so cool I was mesmerized.
13,When I bought this there were 8/240 of these now there are 15/260 mints of #9. Please don’t think I’m a whale or have alpha. Path dependence/wild swing by one purchase is cool game theory though. Also 2 is @XCOPYART 3 is @alexisohanian and 1 is @dmitricherniak buy those.
14,Also would really like to meet this artist once it's reveal @proof_xyz or @/anonartist please dm me.
15,I just became the largest purchase on the Grails Collection.  I felt like I had to do it but fully expect to lose money.   Please don't copy trade people you meet on the internet.  Feeling like a massive degen. https://t.co/fNpYgbeuVI
16,None of this is that complicated and there are all answers and when we have them they will be obvious.  Anyone got any really good clues into these.  I am subject to add more whenever.
17,9. Psychology reading the minds of others/ empathy sympathy understand what to do and say in situations.  Understanding your own thought.

19,"5. Path dependence + multiverse theory.  Why you are  the person you are and the true randomness of that vs your multiverse selves
6. Health how can we optimize it.  Training vs rest.  Diet trade offs. How can we live forever at a healthy age."
20,"3. What is happiness. How can we be truly/ sustainably happy what does that feel like.  Is misery integral to happiness or a barrier. Today vs tomorrow happiness trade off.

21,"Questions that need answers:
1. How do people think/ learn.  What is the true essence of creativity and creative thought.

22,"Cardano is your favorite crypto savant's favorite crypto asset.  If in 10 years Cardano win's and all other chains go to 0, not a single person should be mad. They're either playing the best game of 8D chess ever or ordering M&amp;M's in alphabetical order only time will tell."
23,My first NFT purchase was a mint of meebit's and I got a pig very lucky.  Then I got an ape at 1.7 and proceeded to make a few more positive EV purchases. I can't tell if I am generating alpha or just throwing the stickiest shit at the wall. Anyone else feel like this?
24,@cryptometanon It’s basically a fork of the chain for nfts
25,@cryptometanon Huge risk in doing this but if you create a dao around the community you could vote with some very high like 90% threshold to reissue the nft as is to the original owner. You can’t delete the old one which is actually a very good thing but you can create an identical one
26,Non fungiblity proving to be a massive security feature not a bug despite its illiquidity discount.
27,Stealing eth is one thing and because it’s fungible you can use tornado cash to clean it to some degree. Because Nfts are non fungible you can pinpoint exactly which ones were stolen and your ability to sell them for anything is questionable and impossible to do so at full value.
28,@AdvanceSapiens @ShaneAParrish That quote and the there is now a level 0 quote is my life on loop
29,Doing the mental work to learn about something or someone will increase your affinity to it regardless of it’s merits or your past beliefs. Especially as beautiful craftsmanship is everywhere it’s just up to us to appreciate it.

31,@aaronlbarr @DannySchwartz32 Take a huge risk and pay for Twitter blue for an extra flex not worth it but they do look clean af.
32,@AlyssaMetaverse Good vibes only don’t be so toxic. The answer is the ape though no offense I’m sure you’re a great person but I can’t trust someone who has an ape with an inferior party hat.
33,@RyanSAdams Cardano has changed less than Bitcoin. It’s realizing satoshi’s vision. #Uponlyforever eth can’t compete
34,@BordoniAndres @justinkan @Twitch This is when it clicked for me I played fifa but had to get a new team every year and didn’t actually own anything ea could take your accounts and coins without warning or cause. NFTs pay royalties to EA + you get permanent ownership and overalls evolve with time dynamically.
35,@xycodine What's your background?
36,@dmitricherniak Hey want to grab a coffee and talk about the essence of art and creativity?  DM me in the next couple days and the coffee is on me.
37,When I reach 1 million followers I will dox myself while riding a real T-Rex and gift all of my followers 50 Dino Dollars. Until then my T-Rex will remain in my basement hidden from the world.
38,"@rsg Crypto banks the unbanked Art nfts patron the underpatronized while creating or reenforcing digital identity tying in a community that rewards holders and creators. New medium new art. They’re kinda stupid and crazy, but +/- alpha is the intersection of stupid and crazy."

40,There is always some 10x/-1x games to play and always some foundational value plays there’s also always times to trade and times to invest usually concurrently as well. Most importantly don't use leverage and don't trade ahead of your skis. The worst trade is a forced seller.
41,Then just know when to rotate the portfolio what to hold ect. Sometimes base moneys are relatively cheap so you want to stack vs riskier assets that have run other times they’re expensive or it’s very risk on so you want to disproportionately rotate into risk.
42,Then you have your tee it up and say goodbye bucket where you invest in incredibly risky or scammy things. This is the most fun part and where you maybe identify the meta games early or just -1x all day.
43,"Then you want your meta bucket where you play the hot trade whether it be nfts, defi, alt L1s or just some area you’re really bullish on, curious to hear which one it could be.  This post from @cobie is a great breakdown of this ares. https://t.co/uQma6QdgdD"
44,Then you have buckets in crypto.  Yield farming stables  then value accrual assets btc/USD/eth; you want to stack these core monies. Crypto is benchmarked against 3 value accrual layers.  There may be more or fewer and being right on additional/ fewer is immense alpha. https://t.co/SieVfvhgaM
45,"My best model for crypto is the risk spectrum. You have your buckets for rent, food, leisure, savings/investing. 
In that bucket you x amount in stocks, bonds, cash, crypto, based on risk tolerance/beliefs/level in society/ projection of future incomes/ goals crypto = 5% or 50%."
46,"Human's dying is one of those things in 100-1000 years that we will look back on as a species and think we did we just accept that we had a lifespan.  The only thing preventing immortality is time, and a ton of research/ concerted effort from smarter people than myself."
47,Any established beliefs or dogmas are more of a harm to progress than radical and subtractive beliefs because progress can only happen through change good or bad. Stagnation will always lead to death. Push the boundaries local maximum are a bigger threat than failure.
48,The answer to questions of abundance isn't scarcity its always more abundance.  We live in an infinite and constantly growing universe; there is no reason human's shouldn't be immortal interplanetary beings in the next century. Knowledge is infinite and all powerful.
49,@Bread__Season @ElYogui_PA You can either innovate with technology or innovate with execution. Punks apes art blocks and even @warpsound_ai have done some novel tech and/or roadmap stuff. I’m curious about second derivative things outside of I made this now I’m going to copy paste a game/tv/movie utility.
50,@Bread__Season @ElYogui_PA Any project can raise $3mm out of nowhere. .1 eth 10k nfts 2.5% of 10k eth sales eth at 2.5k. That’s more than enough money to execute on any strategy. Is there any differentiation out there to do something unique? Not saying there isn’t just a huge space tough to see everything
51,"@Bread__Season @ElYogui_PA It’ll be interesting to see if the mid tier nfts can come back from a prolonged bear market. Nfts are a community around number go up at times. Paradigm creators like punks apes squiggles will be around, but will 2-10 eth projects with the same roadmap? idrk where that line is."
52,"@ElYogui_PA How do you square the circle of looks being 1/3rd of open sea value which is priced at 10x revenue. Do you think through incentives the platform can grow, especially with the higher end NFTs, without the lindy of OS?"
53,@opensea is the biggest nft market and they’re integrating a native wallet through @Dharma_HQ so they’re basically making a play as an NFT fiat on-ramp and possibly a centralized exchange for NFTs that soon could counter Coinbase. Dharma is also @0xPolygon native. Big moves here
54,@beaniemaxi Please protect and grow our bags
55,Punks vs Apes is the difference between crypto and web3. @larvalabs @BoredApeYC
56,Got this guy yesterday going to become an angry face party hat maxi now @CryptoMories https://t.co/j1AdzcH9AH
57,You can fork everything in crypto except for community and team. These are the only 2 relevant vectors when evaluating any project from L1s to NFTs.
58,Hey @StephenCurry30 #apefollowape? @BoredApeYC let’s make this happen.
59,"@TheVisionEx @BoredApeYC Love to see people starting to realize this. I posted this with mutants around 6 and apes around 40-50, maybe. This narrative is super undervalued this isn’t just a great community but the leading web3 brand. https://t.co/RahJtfohS1"
60,Thank you @DavidDeutschOxf The Beginning of Infinity is an incredible life changing book and thank you @naval for the podcast that compelled me to read it. What is a good definition and best explanation for creative thought? How is alpha go not creative but Magnus Carlson is?
61,Q1 22 has a chance to be a massive moment for NFTs realizing their goal as tokenized communities. @BoredApeYC will lead with @coolcatsnft following with a token.  New fund money needs to be deployed to start the year. Are nfts the boom or is there another emergent technology?

65,Adidas partnering with @BoredApeYC is just the beginning for the brand. Every brand seeking web3 relevance will make these partnerships and Apes are the clear first choice. TLDR apes are the luxury brand of the future and this brand has a possible 10-12 figure valuation.
66,Expanding past luxury.  @BoredApeYC is the first native web3 community that is also a luxury brand.  The canonical web2 brand Apple is worth almost $3Tr.  Apes are more than a jpeg; they are legitimacy and a movement at the intersection of culture and technology.
67,What is the TAM in terms of comparable luxury brands?  Supreme was valued at ~$1Bn in 2017 in their Carlyle transaction while at the high end LVMH and Hermes are valued at ~$400Bn and ~$200Bn respectively.
68,"How do I get to $1Bn-$10Bn?  Relative value to similar huge web3 brands like ENS, worth ~$5Bn leaves this range reasonable.  Long term $10Bn is low imo; this community has only gotten stronger and created more value for it's user base over time."
69,"Ownership might breakdown differently for Apes/ dogs/ Mutants, but overall the community will be getting a huge windfall similar to past drops.  Buys into this ecosystem has never been more valuable than it will be now."
70,@BoredApeYC is the best brand for web3.  When the governance token drops in a few months ~40k apes/mutants/dogs will get between 25%-50% ownership of the protocol.  At a $1-$10Bn valuation  this is $25k-$500k per holder.

74,A month ago I said @BoredApeYC could flip #cryptopunks by @larvalabs.  Today I am just hoping they can both flip 100 $ETH.  @larvalabs please token?

77,Today I stop being wrong on the @0xPolygon Ecosystem.  Polygon is one of the best ways to invest in @ethereum scaling as many L2's have not released tokens yet.  Investing billions in zk tech + a side chain is the ultimate barbell.  L2's rel val to ALT L1 is under appreciated.
