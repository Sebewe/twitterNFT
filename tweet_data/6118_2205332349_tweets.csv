12,"@pekx__ @ShadowQuest_NFT If you do the math, if every Samsar is staked in the Battlefield they’ll each steal 2 Gen1 NFTs! (18,000/10= 1,800… 18,000/1000= 1.8. So congrats on your 8 incoming Gen 1 Warriors/ Samsars"

20,RT @NFT_Romo: Great thread about @ShadowQuest_NFT. Read up!
21,"@CryptoVonDoom @ShadowQuest_NFT Appreciate the love ✊, can’t wait for what’s in store for us over the next couple of months"
22,"@shoRUUde Anytime, glad that I could help. The more people that can consume this complex white paper in a digestible Twitter-friendly bite sized post, the better!"
23,RT @CryptoVonDoom: Everyone in on (or interested in) @ShadowQuest_NFT should give this post by @VANGOGHeth a read:
24,"Conclusion 3:
 
Players are clearly picking up on this strategy, based on the recent 7 ETH purchase by @Youclidean for a maxed-out Samsar. My bags are packed and I’m ready to see where this Quest takes me. Keep stacking that $HONR and I’ll C U on the Battlefield! 
 
(34/34) https://t.co/DCgPT4qQGK"
25,"Conclusion 2:
 
I couldn’t be happier with how the team has executed up until this point. I think that Stats will play an important role in how you choose your strategy and I currently think that a lot of high-stat Warriors are criminally undervalued
 
(33/34)"
26,"Conclusion:
 
As a #GameTheory fanatic, I’ve always been mesmerized by the future of #P2E NFT Games, and want to learn as much about the industry while it’s still in its infant stages. I specifically wanted 2 invest in a project that had a PVP fighting mechanic

27,"Interstice: The homeland of the Samsars will b unlocked, offering brave Warriors grand rewards
 
Eclipse: Unknown Astrological Event
 
Marketplace, Ruins, Maze, Forge: All TBA at the End of ARC I

Research Centre: Unlock More Weapons, Trinkets, Potions, and Mysterious Powers
 
Training Grounds Upgrades: Allows the Devs to update staking rewards and manage the game’s tokenomics
 
(29/34) https://t.co/E8JPaKPoog"
30,"As we unlock new regions of the map and eventually transition into Arc II of the game. I'm pumped for the 1v1 weekly showdowns between the Top 2 Warriors as they fight for a prize pool of 100,000 $HONR. Rivalries are about to be made
 
(28/34) https://t.co/afl6fkOUSF"
31,"I also liked the @azuki aesthetic and thought that this style combined with a booming #P2E market was a magic formula. The 1/1s are littered with references 2 great NFT projects that paved the way. @talia really outdid herself and Im excited 2 see how this story unfolds
 
(27/34) https://t.co/fd0XsRIB7Z"
32,"Lore/ Art:
 
The 1st thing that stood out to me about #ShadowQuest was the jaw-dropping art. The Lore of 5 warring magical nations and Comic Art Style are both reminiscent of one of my favorite cartoons growing up: Avatar the Last Airbender 

(26/34) https://t.co/kdRx3R5pws"
33,"...And all the other great Mods have used feedback from the community to dictate how different events on the Roadmap launch. Above all else, I invest in people, and this team gives me the same feeling that @dom3xyz and @jo3car gave me when I first invested in @CBCreepz

36,"The Players who stake their NFT and play the game will be rewarded with the most $HONR and those players will be rewarded with the most additional stat-boosting NFTs. These players will be rewarded the most once the Bank opens and $HONR becomes a tradable ERC-20 token
 
(22/34) https://t.co/90QHcLfaNX"
37,"This is only possible by strategically staking your Warriors and Samsars in the TG and BF. Although I would love an LP that would allow me to simply buy $HONR to accomplish this strategy, this Roadmap order adds value to the Generation 0 Warriors and Samsars
 
(21/34)"
38,"The Bank:
 
Although I initially wanted #shadowquest to have a Liquidity Pool ASAP, I now understand y it’s so genius to have the Bank open at the end of Arc I. I think the Meta of this Game Theory puzzle is to mint as many Gen1 Characters, Weapons, Armour, and Potions
 
(20/34) https://t.co/kVgE7TtpsE"
39,"Strategy:
 
I believe that the best way to do this is by acquiring as many Gen1 Warriors and $HONR as possible on the Training Grounds and Battlefield. Since the minting process is all in-game off-chain, this strategy will have minimal costs beyond my initial cost
 
(19/34)"
40,"It’s important that you challenge the Samsar plenty of times before the Emporium is open because you’ll need Glory, Shards, and $HONR. I’m going to try and acquire as many stat-boosting items as possible such as Weapons, Armour, and Potions
 
(18/34)"
41,"The Emporium:
 
The cost will be 4 Glory and 1 Shard. Here players will be able to buy Potions which will increase their chances of winning against the Samsar on the Battlefield. These will be highly valuable since this is a key metric to target!
 
(17/34) https://t.co/fkVFHO0MVA"
42,"Armour:
 
Reduce the 20% fee that you need to pay when fleeing from a Samsar on the Battlefield.
 
Weapons:
 
Increases ur Warrior or Samsar's stats and will also have ~unique effects~
 
Here’s a Google Sheets that lists every single NFT's stats: https://t.co/DxTca9oJEm
 
(16/34)"
43,"Increasing how often you double your Battlefield $HONR earnings will significantly affect your $HONR yield over the long run. You can unlock the Armory by burning 3 Glory and 1 Shard. In the Dojo you’ll be able to mint stat-boosting Armor and Weapons.
 
(15/34)"
44,"The Armoury:
 
Each Warrior and Samsar has a unique blend of stats (Skill, Speed, Strength, Magic, and Health). Your stats will dramatically impact how successful you are on the Battlefield and more importantly your Win Percentage against Samsars
 
(14/34) https://t.co/P3ONTzTaUn"
45,"10% of these will be Gen1 Samsars and 10% of the total Gen1 supply will be stolen by Gen0 Samsars that are staked in the Battlefield.
 
The first Gen1 NFT minted will cost 20,000 $honr and every1 after that will cost 4 extra HONR. So the 2nd 1 will cost 20,004, etc.
 
(13/34)"
46,"The Dojo:
 
Once your Gen0 Warrior has defeated a Dark Samsar on the Battlefield you’ll earn one Glory, which you’ll need to burn in exchange for entrance into the Dojo. Inside the Dojo there’ll be 18,000 Generation 1 Warriors and Generation 1 Samsars available to mint
 
(12/34) https://t.co/qG4Hd8LGG9"
47,"Winning a Samsar Fight= the Samsar loses nothing but the Gen0 Warrior 2x their $honr earnings, and gain other Mystery Prizes (100k $HONR? Shards? Glory?)
 
Losing= your hard-earned $HONR from the Battlefield is stolen
 
Samsars will steal 1,800 of the future Gen1 NFTs
 
(11/34) https://t.co/lmozcYfMuT"
48,"Why @ShadowQuest_NFT Samsars are so valuable:
 
To unstake a Gen0 Warriors from the Battlefield, you either Flee or Fight the Samsar.
Fleeing= 20% of your Battlefield $honr earnings will be divided amongst the staked Samsars.
 
(10/34) https://t.co/8tsoPoL39D"
49,"The Devs plan to upgrade the PvP Battle Mechanics so that you can battle other players head to head and see the damage done with each attack. Winning earns $HONR and losing still upgrades ur stats. Team Battles are also on the way, so choose your alliances carefully
 
(9/34) https://t.co/kYsDZucGjS"
50,"The Battlefield:
 
Expected to open in the next 24 hours! Here #ShadowQuest players can stake their Generation 0 Warriors and Dark Samsars at https://t.co/AZ7Q2pJH61 where they’ll fight in Simulated Battles that are determined based on their character’s stats
 
(8/34)"
51,"Efficient Gas-Saving Staking and Minting Contracts are essential for any successful P2E project. The #ShadowQuest private mint sold out in 58 seconds and the public mint sold out in 12 seconds and people were still able to pay $2.5 per NFT that they minted!
 
(7/34)"
52,"The Groundbreaking @ShadowQuest_NFT Minting Contract:
 
Created by @derkizzle, @pav, and @blockbond and nicknamed “ERC-721:Shadow”. This contract can be up to 95%&gt; efficient than the Standard ERC-271 (BAYC) contract and 35%&gt; efficient than the ERC-721A (Azuki) contract
 
(6/34) https://t.co/QyamfrBOLN"
53,"Gen1 Warriors:
 
If you were to stake your Gen0 Warrior here you’d accumulate 21,000 $HONR in a week, which is enough to mint a Gen1 Warrior/Samsar if you’re one of the first people to mint
 
(5/34)"
54,"The Training Grounds:
 
At the break of dawn on Sunday, the Training Grounds opened, allowing players 2 stake their Generation 0 Warriors and Samsars into the community wallet in exchange for 3,000 $HONR per day. I paid a grand total of $2.325 per NFT that I staked
