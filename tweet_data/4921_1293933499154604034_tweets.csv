33,"@Gee__Gazza @adamtitcher @dagg3rhigh It is not a pyramid, it is just another way to spread the minting, instead of WLs or gas wars.

I believe many collections will use that soon enough, as it allows more community-based minting - saving for friends, giving away, etc.

The community controls the mint."

42,"@Loopifyyy Loop, your insights about play-and-earn games is very true. We forget that getting people to be consistently using something is not that easy - obviously if it is shitcoin related.

The 25 left are going to be selected from the @Achoo_NFT discord, and 1 of them is going to be randomly selected in the following giveaway."
73,"4/6
From the 100 super spreader spots, 25 have already been given.

The 50 people who get an inconclusive result on their Achoo Virus Test Kit, that goes on public minting tomorrow, will be eligible too (https://t.co/tMXuD8PvnL)."
74,"3/6
The cool thing is that the 100 super spreaders are the people who control the virality - they can use the Sneezes to mint more Achoos, give them to friends, sell them, or whatever.

Then, the team can analyze how the @Achoo_NFT pandemic spreads."
75,"2/6
Viral minting is a social experiment where 100 super-spreaders are allowed to mint an @Achoo_NFT, and they also get 10 Sneezes each.

If you have a Sneeze, you can mint another Achoo, but the second batch gets only 5 Sneezes."
76,"1/6
The most exciting social minting experiment in NFTs is coming on March 10th!

It is called viral minting, and it will be tested on @Achoo_NFT project.

So what's viral minting?

77,"@Donnie_Gun They can also give it away. They can play it many ways. That's why it's a social experiment.
