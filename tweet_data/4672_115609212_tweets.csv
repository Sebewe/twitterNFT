Here’s the shill for a very specific PA: https://t.co/4POtQvhZLg"
1,"Seek out the Machines - the Ghostly Shrines 👀

Gn https://t.co/7ekIrvcsCP"
2,@Galaktic_Shaman Interested in adding another rare PA Machine head to your collection? Then it becomes a living for me 👀 https://t.co/4POtQvhZLg
3,@MetaverseNext @psychedelic_nft Appreciate you fam 🙏🏽
4,@Hellaorganics 🙏🏽
5,RT @Hellaorganics: One of my favorites PA genesis is for sale 👀
6,"The hoodie is one of the more vibrant colors in all of PA Genesis, and the aesthetic is certified CLEAN. Priced to reflect its rarity and aesthetic:

https://t.co/T6h24aNHrD

Again, if it doesn't sell, so be it. It will remain at home!"
7,"I don't sell this lightly, and therefore I've priced it at a premium.

PA #7456:
Rarity rank #482 (top 5%)
1/1 Hoodie combo (sweatshirt + hood combo)
1/5 Sweatshirt color (Binary)
Machine Head (seek out the Machines)

25 Eth. 7 Days. If it goes unsold, so be it, I'll keep it. 👇🏽"
8,"Today marks the 1st time I've ever listed my PFP. The reason you ask? I'm #buidling &amp; raising funds to do so. I have full belief in @psychedelic_nft's mission, and will be retaining the rest of my PA holdings including 2x Gen, 5x C1, 4x Meta, 4x IRL, 3X C2, &amp; 3x PAPP.

🐻 Forget about the bear market. Meet your newest #Metaverse BFF - The @WilderPets Bear! 🐻…"
11,"@jacobriglin Yea, everyone is after the mint day moon these days. Doesn't seem like anyone cares about the core of Web3 except a small percentage of the community."
12,"@cenay_18 Don't sleep on the aliens. Check out this tweet if you didn't yet (including my first comment to that tweet for some additional little alpha 👀):
https://t.co/k3bqEYuIgf"
13,@cenay_18 We follow/follow already but can I get a Twitter account rating from 0-10?
14,"@glizzies_eth I’m stretched too thin. If it were the only thing I were focused on, then maybe. If it’s Web3, I’ve already opted out of things like Shikigai, Jovians, etc.

Just not enough time and especially when no clear prize is identified prior to the puzzles starting, you can count me out."
15,@PA8181_ @wdw_io @worldofwomennft Ahh that makes sense 😅 .. nice artwork though. The suit fits!
16,@PA8181_ WDW as in @wdw_io? You know something we dont?
17,"@SpottieWiFi @BoredApeYC Love this indie rapper, @Eminem. I hope he makes it big one day, been rooting for him for a couple decades now."
18,"@Zeneca_33 P.S., He's 5 years old"
19,"@Zeneca_33 My son, renowned finger painter of abstract Kevins, will be glad to offer his services for your project. Anything to help the cause!"
20,@virginfty What about my accelerator team? 👀 Or do you have one already?
21,@virginfty Wanna join my team?
22,@NicoleBehnam What do men do when they did or have none of those things and are posting from their doxxed account? Also wouldn’t be a thirst trap if life depended on it? Asking for a friend of mine
23,@Zeneca_33 0xDf6c3C35bf6cad3921E9A9C03DE970Ff49eFaEe5 https://t.co/0SgK0VwzpR
24,"@artbyviki Yep something realistic, and just a going-forward plan. How do you plan to use the millions that you are likely to earn from mint, and is that worth my investment?

Or be straight up that it’s for the art or the culture or whatever.

Just something genuine and transparent."
25,"@BAYC2745 A thing that RTFKT did very well with CloneX was airdrops for people holding any portion of the ecosystem. If you didnt have a clone &amp; still had the mint vial, or couldn't afford either of those &amp; only had the spacepod, you still got the recent airdrop. Value of all of them 📈"
26,"@artbyviki When I check the Twitter bio and it says ""art by proven artist @ named"", ""experienced business or team run project"", website(.)io, roadmap linked.

When I check all of the above and the artist twitter is &gt;2years old with lots of genuine/authentic engagement, heart beat picks up!"
27,@InvestedThug @BAYC2745 It's all about game theory though too so lets not forget about that core tenet of PA. He technically has already give us a lot of time.
28,"@AFOG0001 @BAYC2745 Yea but any given day he can say something like ""PAPP will be burned upon printing of a new PFP collection"" then 🖨️📈🚀🌕🪐

Time is of the essence.. you never know."
29,"Is it just me or do @BAYC2745's gm tweets incite just a tiny bit of anxiety? Like ""oh crap wheres my ledger where's my laptop do I need to burn do i need to hodl do i need to print what's the deadline is it quick please dont do it in the middle of my meeting""

Just me? okay then"
30,"@NFTpfpPurchaser @sales_anonymous It was a bundle with 4x PAPPs, 1 Gen, 1 Meta Pass, 1 C2. So yea I think it's just referring to the 1 Gen. Confused me for a little"
31,@NFTpfpPurchaser @sales_anonymous Ah okay.. well that's interesting because it was multiple was it not? Looking at the sale history
32,"@sales_anonymous Why does GenieSwap refer to this one as a 1/1? It's rarity rank #3828 and has common traits.

I know technically each is unique due to the large amount of traits PA has. But perhaps the GenieSwap system isn't recognizing the rarity properly?

The good thing is all PA are 🔥🔥"

51,"@ijustine I don’t auto hide, and I keep it on the bottom."
52,@ArtMcArty Funny you say that.. I was at the bar last night and literally everyone was talking about this. !wen
53,@Beno1t_eth @Emsky_bullrun @JB__nfts @InvsbleFriends The speculative pump or dump before an announcement is no different than standard market dynamics even in the stock market pre-earnings or deliverables reports.
54,"@Beno1t_eth @Emsky_bullrun @JB__nfts @InvsbleFriends It’s similar but not an equal comparison here.

The proof is in the deliverables. PA has the strongest leadership team in NFTs, and that alone carries expectations. PA has delivered every step of the way, and have proved it with transparent earnings reports and a detailed roadmap"
55,"@Beno1t_eth @Emsky_bullrun @JB__nfts @InvsbleFriends Right. Like I said, it’s absolutely not a rug because they promised nothing but the animated invisible friends art NFTs which they’ve delivered on. People overhyped and paid based on unannounced expectations though, not the art. They might learn a hard lesson or win a big gamble."
56,"@Emsky_bullrun @JB__nfts @InvsbleFriends If they come out with more info and roadmap about the project, then fair play and let’s see them execute.

Otherwise, unless you were here solely for the art, what were you here for besides the whitelist moon?"
57,"@Emsky_bullrun @JB__nfts @InvsbleFriends I honestly kinda hope that they are done. The NFT community has learned a lot of hard lessons over the past couple months. Nothing was promised from IF.

Could be another lesson learned. Invest your ETH in proven projects with roadmaps, not speculative projects with decent art."
58,@rpnickson Perhaps they should try that route. There's no shame in it and they can maintain creative leadership.
59,"@rpnickson It's wild. The expectations that the community pressures on NFT projects these days are immense. That said, there are many business founders who have a great idea, build an MVP, go to market, &amp; then hire the qualified people to run the business.

Founders ≠ Businesspeople"
60,"@JB__nfts @InvsbleFriends Either they have some inside info that we don't know about in their Discord hidden away, or they're gonna have to make a roadmap announcement soon to maintain floor.

OR they simply do not care and have accomplished their mission. It's not a rug if they didn't promise anything."

69,"Like is there something I'm missing? This excuse doesn't make any sense to me. Plus, I've seen some badass high quality 3D art on OpenSea (see my PFP)."
70,"I don't understand this. Like I get that OpenSea might not be able to handle the biggest files, but how are my @EthaliensNFT Voxels able to look 10000x better than the Pixelmon reveal + it's interactive + it's animated. Not to mention only .03 floor rn:

72,"@SeaMateNFT From the start, would suggest some more info about the founder as it's such a new Twitter account that it doesn't give us much."
73,"@SeaMateNFT I actually like the art on this one. Gonna do a bit of due diligence but I'll keep an eye out!

Would be neat to see some ocean conservation goals with this project."
74,@tokenproof @FonzGm Looking forward to learning more about the product + team!
75,@picoyoda Makes sense!
76,"@picoyoda What should they deduce from that fact, aside from it's a pretty common occurrence through the history of BTC?"
77,"@jacobriglin Hmm that's a tough one. Back when I lived in Missouri, looking out the window onto farmland with trees all covered in undisturbed snow was quite the sight to see after a winter storm. I love winter in short bursts, and summer in longer stretches."
78,@EthaliensNFT Love the extra tats and details!
79,@NFTethics @TFGmykL @ApeKidsClub @NFTMTG @bapesclan Please also look into the project I DM'ed you about which I believe is also shadow backed by this same group of people.

91,"@NFTswithNate I saw a tweet the other day that said something like:

""too many people think about competition instead of collaboration""

I can't remember where I saw it but it makes a lot of sense, and especially in today's world climate. Lets flip the script! Other's success ≠ my failure."
92,@NFTswithNate Moral of the story: Lets not be that community that tears down others just for the sake of it. Let things unfold and then we can say what we wanna say.
93,"@NFTswithNate Lets just sit back &amp; watch. We don't have to predict anything yet because if they announce something great we could all be eating our own words later.

There's been so much fud between crypto/war/hacks/phish/stocks that the next thing was bound to explode."
94,@NicoleBehnam @mv3nft w/ @rpnickson @jmaze_eth and team!
95,"@NicoleBehnam I did it twice because the first time my camera froze over and I didn't realize it until the end when it wouldn't turn on anymore.

Same thing happened the second time 🤦🏽‍♂️ ... I guess I'll spend 20Eth on secondary"
