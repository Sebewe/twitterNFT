42,@Portal_____ @karimo714 @Nate_Rivers @Precisepumps Cyber kongz vending machine is part of the Sandbox collection. If he sold anything in that collections and didn’t revoke it would be susceptible. Not selling a single item isn’t definitive proof of anything. But not sure if this collection was approved or not at the time.
43,"Check out the latest re OpenSea hack from their team below. Likely phishing related. Be sure to Revoke all collections.

Hot Tip - if you receive emails from OpenSea, add their email as a contact and change the picture to something only you would recognize. Easier to spot fakes. https://t.co/V9n2E894fi https://t.co/Cd7GdII0JE"

47,@242hanzo LFG
48,@richerd Totally agree. Web3 was founded on providing artists the freedom to own their work and has become a way for them make a living here. It’s why every collection has royalties and why every collector pays those royalties. Important to carry this message forward.

53,"OR...is the discussion around:
❌Mint price, est. floor price, auction mechanics, fudding flippers
❌Grindy, complex WL with &lt;0.01% odds to win a spot
❌Fake positivity ie. banning legit questions / discussion around roadmaps &amp; teams

Invest in the future web3 you want to see.

54,"Review Twitter comments &amp; join the Discord. Is there a focus on CUSTOMERS ie. users / collectors:
✅Thoughtful discussion on roadmap, utility, founders
✅Safety reminders, security incl. bot prevention
✅WL process that is fair, transparent, and can be attempted in &lt;30 minutes

63,"@NFTArtCritic @Gee__Gazza @BT @crypto888crypto Go for it. Also way to side step the conversation. 

Public was clear that 11 ETH was too steep, so BT and 888 agreed to remove the floor price and let the market decide. Now that the market decided these are worthless it’s okay to pull the sale? In what world?"
64,@NFTArtCritic @Gee__Gazza @BT @crypto888crypto You should be ashamed for defending this cash scam since day 1. BT should be ashamed for launching a cash scam at 11 ETH in spite of clear backlash. But when the price gets too low it’s okay to pull cuz his feelings got hurt? Get rekt
65,@BT You really turned it off?? Seems immoral
66,@basildaaaa Eh I’d rather have an ape 😁
67,"@NFTethics Just look through the founders to see so many red flags. No prior experience except ""how to get rich quick"" schemes. And partnered with many other rugs including Squiggles and Hypebears, and defended by known influencer scammers tmas and co.

I will not be minting."

Also hate to tell ya but @WideawakeBeets created the first generative audio &amp; visual NFT. And the cost was ~$20, not ~$30k. Probably nothing though. https://t.co/F2aXKBUhpv https://t.co/UEtFKoDza6"

87,@economist I was super impressed. Waves changed from one to the next effortlessly. Only change I’d consider is to reduce time between waves - most of the buys happened in the first 5 minutes and other 55 min was waiting. And overall drop time was ~9 hours which is a bit long.
88,@Gfunkera86 @pixelvault_ @ape6743 @steven_schill @Gold_Rilla @242hanzo @topshotswickie @KingBlackBored @lonestarsacca @tropoFarmer Best mechanic by far. Great to see the team pivot from Punks#2 to this queue system. PV innovating once again
