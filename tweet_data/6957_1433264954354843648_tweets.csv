6,"@SHL0MS Be honest @SHL0MS, Did you or did you not sink that ship carrying Lambos to help reduce the supply of lambos people could blow up trying to imitate you?"
7,"@DrewRipsCards @DaryRezvani Ah yes, baseball as the stand in for America. That idea has never caused any problems, like 100+ years of tax sheltering."
8,"@DrewRipsCards @DaryRezvani Yes, baseball’s decline in fans and attendance has been because of a willingness to lock players out."
9,"@DrewRipsCards @DaryRezvani By all means, let the players take their incredibly useful skills to all of the other professional baseball leagues where players have it better."
10,"@DrewRipsCards @DaryRezvani The season is too long, that’s not mismanagement that’s a lack of excitement and enthusiasm for the sport. The entire business is bad not just a specific team."
11,@cryptobrickz Coinbase NFT?
12,@aeyakovenko ADA. Guaranteed no one tries to come after it
13,@JodieCrook @LazyLionsNFT @NFTCryptoChicks Soon enough!
14,@JHead1984 Tbh the government should not be allowed to charge students more on their government backed loans than the federal interest rates. Full stop.
15,"@DaryRezvani I know. It’s bullshit and a generally bad thing for the game. QBs can get tackled, pitchers should bat."
16,@DaryRezvani Can you imagine if Centers could just have a Designated Shooter for free throws?
17,"@DaryRezvani Good counter points. Make pitchers bat, then I’m in."
18,@jemgold_ Leo DiCaprio’s press team is going hard for that EGOT
19,"@DaryRezvani TBH I feel like it’s the players who are hurting themselves here. They’re playing a sport whose fan base is continually shrinking, maybe not the time to strike when the business is going downhill?"

22,Hoping @Ukraine can HODL the hell out of its crypto donations and just buy up Russian state controlled assets for pennies once they’ve repelled them.
23,@SHL0MS I don’t always buy NFTs but when I do it’s in the last few hours of a Motzei Shabbat auction
24,@jessesingal Is this a “Clarence Thomas must be a shill for his white wife’s politics” subtweet?

28,@jemgold_ Any online recommendations to try and get started?
29,"@jemgold_ I hope to find them one day, I really enjoy singing. I just wish it was more pleasant for those around me."
30,"@Jason How long until he calls out the @CNNplus for being a terrible brand with failed economics in an over saturated market? “Let’s look at my contract for example, this type of spending is a huge red flag!”"
31,Beginning to think @Coinbase_NFT is the friends we made along the way.

34,"@jemgold_ I wish I could sing, it’s not the sheets that scare me, I just can’t seem to get the tone/pitch/volume right"
35,@DaryRezvani Peak stakeholder theory
36,"@DannyGodbout Ah, yeah, I don’t pretend I know anything more than anyone else, but it’s shocking how Americans seem completely ignorant that our actions will have generational consequences, particularly if we cheer on financially crippling civilians. It’ll make it easier for the next dictator."
37,@DannyGodbout Can you elaborate?

42,"I’m seeing a lot of people calling for severe economic harm to everyday Russian citizens and I genuinely do not understand, has no one has studied history? Why would we turn a generation of peaceful Russian citizens into the next post-WWI Germany? Target the leaders."
43,@jessesingal How about Germany post WWI? Seems like a pretty good reason as why not to do this…
44,@sadlyoddisfying If I told you the absolutely absurd word that I guessed which gave me the answer you’d be even more disturbed.

50,@country_girlnft @not_madi_ @NFTs_girl @Thetrueastwest I love innovative NFT expansion and @Thetrueastwest is one of the best NFT remixers I know. He’s been pumping out personalized derivs for people of their NFTs for months.

57,@kittypurrzog Never did I think guessing “puree” would have such a positive impact
58,@kittypurrzog The word should just be CUCKS everyday to put us all in our place and remind us who’s boss.
59,I have to say following @DrifterShoots legal post-military saga and seeing it culminate in @Sothebys recognizing his work for the masterpieces they are is just an incredibly beautiful thing. I don’t know Isaac personally but I am so damn proud.
60,I put my @LazyLionsNFT in my ledger and I’ve never looked back. Might have to scoop another one soon.

73,"@Jay_Albert_ I don’t think Amazon’s issue was funds, it was a captive audience, and BAYC definitely has that"
74,@Jay_Albert_ They definitely have the funds to get a team to make games
75,"@degz But like, if there’s a billion of them and anyone can have them, why would anyone want to?"
76,@Jay_Albert_ Maybe they’ll buy the IP to donkey Kong

84,"@degz Apes don’t seem all that illiquid to me, but creating a useless shitcoin associated with their brand would be an easy way to drop the value of their “illiquid” token and tank the value of the supposedly “liquid” one."
85,@ArcanaRue @k2_nft Thanks! Big fan of the art- I’ll 👀 the discord to get some updates

89,"@k2_nft @ArcanaRue Yeah, I think they’re very cool, just don’t know why they haven’t taken off as a female-led pfp project"
90,"Also, highly advise learning some basic life skills as well. There seems to be a gross inverse correlation between the two (very vital) skill sets. https://t.co/kHp8rQQMqK"
91,@markthepixel 👁
92,Can somebody with a BAYC explain to me why they would even want $ape token? It seems like the easiest way to severely devalue the project.
93,Why did @ArcanaRue never take off?
94,RT @chiefgayofficer: i raised a tiny angel round &amp; pay my interns. y’all are annoying.
95,@mdudas @alexkehr Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line!
96,"@mdudas “I don’t know how to Google” is not the same as “this has never been done before”. 

Honestly, these people should all write a basic academic paper with a literature review before they unleash their next Twitter rant."
97,@mdudas My working theory is that these guys have spent so much time convincing VCs that they’re “disrupting the way X is done forever” that they don’t realize that half the shit they come up with is either common knowledge or has been done before. It’s sad to see.
98,"@aeyakovenko @pmacaverse Term limits wouldn’t prevent them from seeking other roles in government or NGOs if they feel like there is significant work to be done. Allowing pols to maintain the incumbency advantage ad-Infinitum is like allowing only existing nodes to validate tx, eventually it corrupts."
99,"@aeyakovenko @pmacaverse Hi, most people don’t like their incumbents, they have the highest name-ID and are more likely to get funding from out-of-state and district voters who want to shape who you’re able to vote for. Parties should have more power, at the very least at the primary level."
