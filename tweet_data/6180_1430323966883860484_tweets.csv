1,@westinft Same 👑 in it for the long haul king 👑
2,@ethgarden There are only a few things in life that are certain. This is one of those things
3,@JoJooo_eth So true king 👑 🙌
4,@_LoneWolf3 💯💯💯👑👑👑
5,"@GamecockCrypto @Coinbase_NFT I think they’re gonna crush it, but would really like some clarity of when the marketplace is actually going to come. The tease hype has sorta worn off and now would love to just know whether it’s happening soon or not."
6,@_LoneWolf3 Yeah definitely tough in this space when we see so much garbage rocketing while quality sits dormant. I chased some hype early on and got rekt so no do what I can to temper my fomo and focus on conviction plays.
7,@Way2BusyGaming I def think you made a good move on the llama 🦙
8,Sentiment check - How you feeling in the projects you’re invested in during this sideways movement? I bought a seal at the top of the market but I’m still feeling cozy. Holding my lions since august. I believe in the projects and founders I’ve invested in.
9,@GamecockCrypto 😂 well at least there’s movement happening! That’s gotta be a plus? 😂
10,@OttoSuwenNFT Agree that alt season and nft season most likely wouldn’t happen at the same time but I can see an alt season with profits starting nft season. But perhaps from now on NFTs are the new alts and no one bothers with shitcoins anymore bc theyre not as fun
11,@LazyLionsNFT X @PUMA https://t.co/chajV9ydr2
12,@LazyLionsNFT 👑👑👑
13,@SearchDecoder I think if they wait that long they’ve gotta make some type of announcement of when. They keep on hinting that it’s coming “very soon” after they said by end of 2021. People going to stop caring at some point if there’s no clarity in my opinion
14,@CryptoLeVibin 😂😂😂
15,"@DarQsolstice NFTs are the future, the very distant future 😂 coming 2037"
16,@BrendanBald 😂😂😂 your NFTs gonna pump for your bday party with your grandkids
17,@CollNFT Ya good point king - now that they’re public co they’re prob motivated by things like that
18,@stavianafam Lol 😂
19,"So what’s your coinbase nft marketplace prediction? I predicted February and I was so wrong. Coming soon, end of year, never?"
20,@Mortpoker 😂 for sure
21,@JoePetrusky 😂 you won’t know unless you retweet and tag 3 friends though!
22,@kdubayou https://t.co/AjPofwAScs
23,@Mortpoker Please don't dm your seed phrase though.  Please nobody ever dm your seed phrase.
24,It's pretty clear at this point that Kevins are going to flip BAYC
25,"@SlippySlapperz fuck, I'm in"
26,@SlippySlapperz but do they earn pixl?
27,@sandy_carter @LazyLionsNFT @Disko_Leopard @UnstoppableWoW3 @unstoppableweb True queens 👑👑👑
28,@Mortpoker CONGRATULATIONS!!! You've won the BAYC! Dm your seed phrase and you'll receive it in your wallet within 6-12 business days!
29,"Just right click saved this NFT! What floors we sweeping?

Tag 3 friends.  Follow.  Retweet. 

And maybe you'll win a BAYC! https://t.co/c6284wPVtf"
30,@_kwux_ @ThePixlverse 👏👏👏
31,@kingbearries @SappySealsNFT @LazyLionsNFT Will do king!
32,@FujiLoops @ThePixlverse @SappySealsNFT Damn thank god.  I sold an earth egg to buy another seal.  Don't think I could've handled that one hatching into a deity 🙏🙏🙏
33,@kingbearries @SappySealsNFT @LazyLionsNFT I've got 5 instrumentals that I made for the Lions VRchat.  Maybe I should release those soon.  No lyrics in them though
34,@FujiLoops @ThePixlverse @SappySealsNFT with 3/4 earth moves I'm guessing from an earth egg?
35,@nik_the_general @ThePixlverse wtf hatched?!
36,@TheNFTCaptain @ThePixlverse Same.  But 1 pixl pet = 1 pixl pet
37,@kingbearries @SappySealsNFT @LazyLionsNFT You win either way with a lion or a seal pfp.  Both are kings 👑👑👑
38,@wabdoteth @ThePixlverse TAG 3 FRIENDS WHILE YOU'RE AT IT!
39,@crispy_laneta Thanks king 🙏 new prediction: not sure the marketplace will ever get released 😂
40,Okay so maybe he didn't make it to 100k followers but this prediction was pretty spot on imo.  The launch was incredible and sealfluencing still at top of the game https://t.co/dDCcbYs7Qv
41,This prediction came true. He's backkkkk.  OF COURSE. https://t.co/i0l3USH4dV
42,This did not happen.  Can't be right every time. https://t.co/5feCwLehUK
43,@ethgarden 😂
44,@ethgarden Ethereum logo looks like an air pixl pet
45,@cryptjoe9 If you do it I’m humbly requesting 69% of mint proceeds
46,@cryptjoe9 This could be the NFT image for your alpha group
47,Finally got a chance to listen to the @LazyLionsNFT @AshurNFT interview of @JohnTerry26. Such a great flowing talk between these kings 👑 great to hear John’s passion and knowledge about the space. Great to have him as a partner to our community 🙌👑👑👑 https://t.co/9ubyPfESWC
48,@ShrewdCharlie For sure there’s an over saturation in relation to the number of people who are active in the space now but if you think about the number of pfp collections needed so everyone in the metaverse can have an avatar… they’re gonna keep coming for a long time imo (most to 0 tho)
49,@carlosgil83 Sappy seals
50,@hungoverape Thanks for this - very good info to know and for sure it’s all dependent on finding the right developers and having a strong concept to start with. 🙏🙏🙏
51,@woozy_pelican @LazyLionsNFT For sure - been amazing to see the community grow from 3k in august to over 5k now 👑👑👑
52,How much do you think it would cost to develop a game on NFT worlds?
53,"Friendly reminder: not your keys, not your coins. 

Exchanges can always be forced to comply with whack govt orders and block your funds. 

But they can’t seize your assets if you control the keys. 

With the global landscape shifting faster than ever this is of peak importance"
54,@NonFungibleBean @crystalhefner Lazy lazy Sunday today 🏝🙌👑👑👑
55,@Mortpoker @Diditaihuttu @SappySealsNFT @monftersclub @ALPACADABRAZ @robotosNFT This is great 🙌 would be hilarious if one day you could go to a car dealership and buy with NFTs
56,Drove past this massive @tristaneaton mural in West Palm Beach 🏝 today. Made me appreciate the @Gemma_NFT collection even more. https://t.co/BXztt5rFok
57,@MidCapNFT @Llamaverse_ @NFTLlama Agree - love all of them. Don’t have one but these for sure are going to do well for many reasons
58,@stavianafam Lol this one is hilarious 😂
59,@wabdoteth @garyvee @SappySealsNFT @ThePixlverse But what if Gary vee is already a seal on one of his alt accounts? https://t.co/SyJZnQKsq5
60,@ct710_ @ThePixlverse Shocked 😮- will be so dope if it does. One of many reasons I’m holding this baby https://t.co/YUwyfw7jcK
61,@grouchy_peanut @ThePixlverse Oh nice! They’re all going up over the long term - we’ll see which goes highest 🙌
62,@joolz3500 @ThePixlverse Dao tokens one of the biggest things coming imo
63,@Meansurphy1 @ThePixlverse Same I’m really hoping this will get a land WL
64,@TheMaineMariner @mcleod0x_eth @LazyLionsNFT 2 dope lions in one day 👏👏👏👑👑👑
65,Founders pass is my most valuable NFT and may always be. My guess is that the largest allocation of @ThePixlverse Dao tokens will go to FP holders. Just a guess though https://t.co/cb5PgIhnKD
66,@austinonchain No joke I’m pretty sure this is one of the things that the expansion apes with the yellow backgrounds changed
67,@BrendanBald @noncoducks @nftworldsNFT 💯💯💯
68,"@k_monkey1520 For sure - prices are pretty good on the pets right now in my opinion, seals too. I think having even one seal in the future is gonna be incredible"
69,@k_monkey1520 They released them as a separate whitelist release. The pets are for the play to earn game to earn $pixl. You can breed and uplevel the pets with $pixl too. And you get daily pixl with your staked seal. They’re for sale now on OpenSea: pixl pets genesis
70,@dj_caffeine @noncoducks Not 100 percent sure how it will work but looks like we’ll be able to stake our ducks for $wrld
71,This makes me want to get more ducks asap https://t.co/nTBKw1y3rb
72,@noncoducks @CRAnthony3 @nftworldsNFT This is awesome 👏👏👏
73,"Key traits: ""Branches as horns"" and ""Chicken in Mouth"" 

Doesn't get better than that. https://t.co/aC6s9GsShM"
74,My guess is that this guy is rare AF.  Better than a deity imo. https://t.co/Mbks5WNngS
75,@nik_the_general Nik gonna have all 3 deities and win every battle and beauty contest
76,@K_Dreamz_ @NFT_Moonshot @LazyLionsNFT Amazing lion king 👑👑👑
77,@davidoksman @0xMac1 @LazyLionsNFT 😂😂😂 on point with the memes
78,@0xMac1 @LazyLionsNFT Lol that would be a great storyline - somehow that glitched one got unglitched and @davidoksman bought it
79,@ItsJustHerc It got to .6? Damnnnn - either way you got a great deal.  I got my first 2 early on but paid 1.7 for my 3rd and still feel like I got a great deal
80,@ItsJustHerc 3 seals is the way 🙌
81,@LazyLionsNFT Cuz no-one calls him King 👑
82,@ryandlns You got this bro!
83,@0xMac1 @chinsei_ Thanks Mac - super stoked
84,@ryandlns Only a matter of time before the dominos fall.  I seriously was planning on never hatching
85,@chinsei_ @0xMac1 This is very good news! Thanks for this - yeah I'm really happy with the pets that I got
86,"Well, I caved and hatched all 3.  Who's got that move alpha? https://t.co/I4jlsk95gm"
87,@ryandlns They made the hatching experience so awesome that it's tough to stop.  I didn't stop... lol - hatched all 3
88,"Today's been heavy, so I hatched an air pixl pet to lighten my mood.  This shit is addicting and I probably won't be able to stop myself on the next two now. https://t.co/P18yxmxySn"
89,@tehnatureboy Roarrr
90,"Sorta looking to me like that was a short panic sell dip, and many of the solid projects may rebound quick.  Maybe not reach the same highs right away, but jpegs looking like they're gmi after all."
91,@Wynneing @bugs3023 @WynneingETH will def take it.  Pugfrens maxi.
92,@SuperMayan Strong hands king! 👑👑👑
93,@tehnatureboy Never fucking leaving.  They're gonna have to drag me out of here ✊
94,"@Wynneing It's sorta inevitable.  If invisible friends can do it, pugfrens can"
95,@realkennycopey Good move king 👑
96,"@BrendanBald 💯 if there's a prolonged bear, I'll be here grinding.  Ready to ride it all to 0 and back up to 100 eth"
97,@DomKro86 Yeah you do what you need for you king. Much respect for trusting your choices 👑🙌
98,@Vashishtuday No extra words necessary 😂 this guy says all I need to know.  I have one with the same costume.  Holding til 100 eth floor
99,@jjshah01 Blue chip confirmed
