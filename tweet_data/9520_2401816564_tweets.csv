The rarity rank is 103 overall and the only multigrin with lower rarity rank is gold fur, awesome opportunity #BoredApeYC #BoredApeYachtClub https://t.co/2UM54gNDA2"

12,Say what you want about @BoredApeYC but we every time the market appears on the ropes a new celebrity purchase comes or some massive sales happen and pulls the nose up. These change the whole market energy. That’s what you need from #1. #bayc #BoredApeYC

New ape who dis?  Feel in love with the simplicity and clean looks of this fella. IMO sunglasses are the best non-rare trait in BAYC. Instantly makes almost any ape top aesthetics https://t.co/ZsDT81NsX9"

38,@SCUncensored Probably not a bad buy if a raw red sold for $2000 and a raw refractor sold for $1000
39,@PrepsToThePros @PltTiger @mcuban @opensea Yeah but I wasn’t trying to rug. My plain was to sit on it to see if anyone claimed a bug. Bit me in a$$. Lesson learned
40,@Jie1Bu @asmanpili1 Ty 🙏🏻
41,@PltTiger @PrepsToThePros @mcuban @opensea Yes is was. I was securing to wait to see if this exact glitch happened to someone. That’s why I didn’t immediately take a WETH offer.  Then it triggered an old listing for me at 18.5 so I basically lost 13 eth myself :(
42,@PeortSitid 👊🏻🤝
43,@relliK_booN I think it was listed for 25.95 on looks rare and only 23.95 on open sea as I go back and look…so probably would have still bought it on OS
