0,@Lazaroni_i @CryptoHootsNFT @shuffledao 2/2 but breeding utility should come as well soon and you are able to stake this Baby Hoots as well on @shuffledao that means it will be still possible for everybody to join this ecosystem.
1,@Lazaroni_i @CryptoHootsNFT @shuffledao 1/2 Hoots has already now almost no listings. This supply shock will even increase more with staking. Even a 2 ETH floor would still be undervalued with that utility. Probably most of the space will get outpriced before they will realize it.
2,RT @CryptoHootsNFT: Who's ready for Hoot home banners? 🦉🏠 https://t.co/HvtXoorjXA
3,@RaoulGMI @CryptoHootsNFT @shuffledao 3/3 it’s difficult to explain this on Twitter. We have a very active discord community. I would recommend to join here for more information. A medium article + Whitepaper for ShuffleDAO should be public available soon.
4,@RaoulGMI @CryptoHootsNFT @shuffledao 2/3 So you don’t need to choice a special NFT anymore to profit from this space. With ShuffleDAO you are getting rewarded for every new project launch in their ecosystem. It is like having a ETF for NFTs. There will be other ways as well to participate on this ecosystem.
5,"@RaoulGMI 1/3 @CryptoHootsNFT is launching their @shuffledao soon. You just need to stake your Hoot on their webpage. NFT projects can use ShuffleDAO as help to launch their project against a part of their revenue. Everybody who staked their NFTs, will profit now with every new project."
6,"@doublex103 @wizardofsoho Long way for Hoots, but 100% possible."
7,I had a long conversation with @doublex103 on @CryptoHootsNFT Discord. Both of us are really bullish about Hoots. We think that Hoots are building a ecosystem with unique utility. Even conserative assumptions indicate to me that Hoots are undervalued.
8,@CyberKongz is for me the biggest blue chip in this space. @CryptoHootsNFT will be soon a established blue chip as well. Invest in teams that are building non-stop and delivering utility for their holder. 🔜 ShuffleDAO https://t.co/AxPcZ8kEJJ
9,@Crazy_Skullz any plans for a passive way to earn $WRLD with staking our Skullz?
10,@Crazy_Skullz @nftworldsNFT @engin28097293
11,@NoKapRich Did you add already @Crazy_Skullz to your WRLD bag?
12,@zerototom Actually really difficult for p2e games to calculate a APR if you have unique stats for each NFT. But your list is a perfect indicator!
13,"@zerototom Okay, makes sense because the floor ones mostly are not leveled. They are in the battle zone, but if you buy them and level them for 10-20 days that Fur rate should at least be doubled."
14,@zerototom How did you calculate that $FUR rewards rate? Seems like to low for the average Furball (every Furball has a different Furrate).
15,"RT @0x0675: Btw, the @CryptoHootsNFT team is at #ETHDenver, building one of the most utility-driven defi-NFTs in the space. Do your future…"
16,RT @FurballsNFT: Think we nailed what edition 2 Furballs will look like last night 🙊
17,@the_x2y2 I did the pre-requisites for the claim. Will I be fine after you resume the airdrop or will this pre-requisites change as well? When can we claim our airdrops?
18,@zerototom @CryptoHootsNFT I think you know @DystoApez already. They will launch a WL marketplace where you can buy with their $SCRAP Token. @FurballsNFT is my favourite P2E Game and they are creating high demand for their utility token $FUR.
19,@zerototom @CryptoHootsNFT 2/2 Cryptohoots team is working on ShuffleDAO right now. You can stake your Hoot to receive $MINT Tokens. So Cryptohoots will give you two different tokens ( 1 utility token and 1 DeFi Token)
20,@zerototom 1/2 @CryptoHootsNFT has a utility token named twigs. This token will be used in the future for breeding and other utilities.
21,@DystoApez marketplace should be launch soon. https://t.co/iOrnLOoBRA

24,@zerototom @0xPolygon did it and it worked really well for them.
25,Adding more Hoots is always good. My thesis is that @CryptoHootsNFT will perform even in a bear market very good and will be one of the biggest blue chips in few months. ShuffleDAO will bring a lot of new people to this space. https://t.co/McOAqOuTAc

55,@Inu_Capital Could you explain please why it seems like on dextools that your treasury wallet is selling? Do you accumulate ETH for dividends with this selling? I just try to understand that approach. @Bxn_W and @theemr2006 FYI.
