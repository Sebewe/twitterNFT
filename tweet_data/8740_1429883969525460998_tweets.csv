14,@mferpapi @iloveponzi Obviously you guys are going to say that this project is awesome because you got one. I would be doing the same thing. But in my opinion that project won’t have value long term.
15,@LooksRareNFT You guys should do something about the price… easy for you to pump the price with a little investment. Otherwise this project is going to die 😕
16,@mferpapi @iloveponzi So what else? Art is awful and 0 utility. The only reason it’s because people think this will continue going up non-stop but once that mentality stops the price will go down drastically and won’t go up anymore because there is not utility coming.
17,@iloveponzi A lot of projects have this kind of fomo and the art do not matter. But at the end utility is what makes the project strong long term. In this case I feel once the fomo stops the price will fall drastically because they don’t have roadmap or utility coming

19,@Snowden What if the crash was intentional so people like you post about it making them more trending 👀😂
20,Its funny seeing people saying $LOOKS it’s a rug just because the price dropped. They are clearly new to this. And I will tell you something that helped me a lot. Millionaires are made on streets full of blood. This is the best time to buy if you think like a millionaire.

55,"@relliK_booN @negithenagi @ElectionDayMad1 Thanks. Actually I got very lucky with my first nft project. It was Rumble Kongs and I liked so much the idea that I went almost all in on mint 😂
After that I have minted just fail projects but like you said. It’s part of the nft world."
56,@relliK_booN @negithenagi @ElectionDayMad1 Yeah. I suppose it depends on the project but it feels bad when they ignore people because they don’t have an ape. Anyway. Good luck with your ape. Personally I think you did good. I wish I had that money to buy one too 😅😂
57,@relliK_booN @negithenagi @ElectionDayMad1 In a way saying “wl to ape holders”feels like you guys are keeping away from those projects the new people or the people that don’t have that amount of money. But it’s just an opinion…
58,"@relliK_booN @negithenagi @ElectionDayMad1 I’m just saying Ape holders were so lucky to be here when BAYC minted or are lucky in life to have that kind of money to buy one for 100k-200k.
So why give wl spots to that people instead of new people that don’t have that kind of money…"
59,@relliK_booN @negithenagi @ElectionDayMad1 Yes but if someone has $250k to buy an ape it means he is already rich…

77,I sold $shib way too early. That’s not gonna happen to me again with $sos. It could be the new $doge or shib in the nft world
78,@Digginit23 @BoredApeYC Yes but they need to deliver something else. I liked Rumble Kongs since the beginning for the game idea. I know a lot of projects put a game on the roadmap but @RumbleKongs actually have a AAA company developing the game. And now @StephenCurry30 and a lot more NBA players are in
79,@cryptorecruitr I prefer to look for other opportunities like Luna for example. Luna graph is how we expected ADA graph look this end of year
80,@adahumanity @cryptorecruitr I want ADA to succeed but I’m being realistic here. And all this influencers shilling ADA 24/7 looks very desperate
81,@NFShme @RumbleKongs Me too haha. The only ones that I didn’t sold are the ones where the project is already dead 😅
82,A lot of people buying some trash nfts meanwhile we have Kongs partnering with Steph Curry and UnderArmour. I stopped minting weeks ago because from of all the projects I minted only @RumbleKongs didn’t disappointed me https://t.co/XVv3jmLQyc
83,"@cryptorecruitr Luna and Ada had almost the same price one year ago. 

            1 year ago I Today 

ADA      $0.25      I   $1.22
Luna     $0.40      I   $80"
84,@cryptorecruitr ADA and Luna had almost the same price one year ago. Right now one of them has a price of $1.22 and the other $80…
85,@cryptorecruitr Are you serious? The big crypto pump was between December 2020 and February 2021. That means that almost all the top projects have a good performance if you compare today’s price with price before December 2020. ADA was at this same price in February. That’s disappointing.

92,@sickpencil Haha yeah. I got very lucky to mint some good stats kongs and also a rare fur. This clean Kobe has 244 so it’s not so bad to be a rare fur 👌🏼
93,@sickpencil I have one with 253 and other with 269. I didn’t saw the stats of this cute when I sold it. She’s strong. That hurts even more now haha
94,"@sickpencil Haha yeah. I sold it super cheap. I was new in this nft world and I wanted to secure some earnings just in case 🥲
At least I kept the clean Kobe and some good stats kongs 😅"

You bought that cute from me months ago. 🥲😂"
