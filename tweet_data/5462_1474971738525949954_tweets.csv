1,Love listening to this space - hearing #artists support each other. The #nft art community needs more genuine actors like @SkurpySocial to push and facilitate the growing trend of connecting artists with their collectors as well as other artists. It’s a great time to be alive. https://t.co/gWOb9AlJZw

12,"I didn’t get in on @HOWLERZNFT but the amount of backlash they’re getting for the BOTched minting bot-fest that ensued from their “stealth launch” is another #web3 example of lost time, effort and opportunities for the discord faithful. @iSocialFanz @garyvee Thoughts? https://t.co/qMBwEoDZTK"
