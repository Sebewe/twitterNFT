70,@cryptoendgamer AoT was my gateway drug into anime. Absolutely love it.
71,Sorry for the rant 😅 Just feeling pretty good right now. Is this the part where I hashtag #ApeFollowApe ?
72,"5/5 So when I opened my laptop this morning and saw this ape sitting on the #BAYC floor for 94.55 ETH ($275,000), I knew it would be an easy decision to make. I can afford it because it's more than a monke .JPG, it's a story. This story belongs to me, and it's only the beginning."
73,"4/5 Like many of you, I’d wake up, dress my best, put on a smile and drive to work overtime in a job that could honestly care less about me. It was my daily routine, and it was slowly but surely driving me insane. I look at this ape, and imagine that he's been through the same..."
74,"3/5 Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, when @dt_chain purchased BAYC #2655 off the floor for 104 ETH. The Steve Jobs-esque wool turtleneck, the crazy eyes, and the dumbfounded mouth. This ape struck a chord with me. It shares a story so similar to my own that it's almost comical..."
75,"2/5 Picture this, in 2020, I would break a sweat after every debit card swipe. Watching that loading icon go around and around just hoping that my transaction would finish and say ""approved"". Now here I am 2 years later, doing the same, but this time for a $275,000 purchase."
76,"1/5 Started with $5,000 in 2021 and now I’m here… I’ll be the first to admit, it’s been a journey. I was hesitant about purchasing a #BAYC, not because of the project, but because of the price. Could I seriously afford to spend $275,000 on a picture of a cartoon ape? https://t.co/b83h8wKwgC"
