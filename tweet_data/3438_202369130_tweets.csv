6,@JordanHilePhoto That’s awesome! Definitely interested so let me know or I’ll keep my eyes on your account for info.
7,@JordanHilePhoto Ooooo I’m interested
8,"@ckyn29 Dang, that was a good idea! I should have sold something for a loss and just bought in. I would have made back my loss and then some. It’s tough watching things you talk yourself out of, take off."
9,@ckyn29 I messed up and didn’t buy at 0.8. Now I’m watching it take off.

11,"Currently, one of my NFTs (I have two) is earning me:

Daily:       10 coins per NFT
                 Currently at $3.13 per coin

Annually:   $11,315

That’s not ALL the passive income. This project is significantly undervalued for a LOT of utility and a GREAT team.

14,@chris_da_guru @AviCennaverse I agree. Collectively we can make the floor whatever we want. I guess people don’t like money because if we list it at 6 it will sell at 6.

18,"@N8Howell33 @coolcatsnft This is literally my goal. I’m working on this and it’s not easy. If you have any tips, I’d welcome them. One thing I’ve learned is buying into a project at the beginning means it can take a long time for the value to rise up."

21,"NFT SPACE!

I understand ""DYOR,"" but this space isn't just about doing it alone, we're suppose to be a community. Yes, DYOR, but also the knowledge others have in the space about projects is EXTREMELY useful in the research process. Yelling, ""DYOR!"" is anti-community. 

2 cents."
22,@joshbobrowsky Thanks! I like these projects and honestly it’s hard to pick between @coolcatsnft and @doodles because they’re both incredible projects. I chose Doodles because I can get a cool pet and be apart of the community whereas there is no coolpet equivalent for doodles that I can get.

Buying something at floor that's middle of the collection rarity, so you can make the most on a flip... or buying something above floor with great rarity (1000 out of 10,000) ?

Opinions?"

Then maybe I’d have enough for a BAYC. 😉"
65,"@J0hnMal0neNFTer This is crazy!! This is incredible generosity! 20k would change soooo much! Honestly, I don’t have enough for a mutant BUT I’d try any and everything to put that money towards a mutant of my own. I’d never sell no matter the price. I just want to be apart of that community."
66,@Dmatias27 @MisterArtsyNFT @BoredApeYC Who’s waiting? You assume too much. Take care.
67,@TheRatdogMan This guy is so cool! It looks like your @coolcatsnft and my @Deadfellaz both have office jobs hahaha
68,"@Dmatias27 @MisterArtsyNFT @BoredApeYC I just feel bad for you. Have a good day. Don’t worry, things will get better."
69,@liquiddensity Tough! I love them both but I’d go with a cat because I’d want to pair a pet with a cat.
70,@Dmatias27 @MisterArtsyNFT @BoredApeYC I was in a Spaces the other day where a whale gifted a random person a mutant and bought someone else a bored ape. It’s not being petty to want an ape and jokingly put it out there if someone wants to gift you one. It’s petty to comment on the post thinking your better.
71,@MisterArtsyNFT @BoredApeYC I want one so badly is tattoo it on my arm if someone gave me one… because I don’t have even close to enough money to buy one myself. I’d tattoo a mutant too if that’s what someone gave me. I want to own it like my real face.
72,@holistichabib @niftygateway Thanks man! Finally got it!
73,@frandsoh Thanks! It’s good to finally be apart of the community! That’s such a cool banner!
