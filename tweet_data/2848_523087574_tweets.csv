10,@SpottieWiFi Maybe take a look at the non-scarce model as well: @Nifty_Island going into closed alpha for 🏝️-holders today and invites everyone into a golden metaverse by giving you an island for yourself.

13,"@wordsofNFTs @ExpansionPunks That means that the the asset was (probably) obtained by the seller by scamming someone else. OS might lock the asset for trading on their platform. @nftlily s wallet was swiped, maybe this was one of theirs."
14,"@CozomoMedici I am obviously biased as the dev of ExpansionPunk but I think there is a room for those projects and they add to original and the overall space, if done in a certain, respectful way. 
We wrote about this extensively here https://t.co/WfxBMuajgm and here https://t.co/hL2DYcVlFc."
15,"@0x_kamal @ExpansionPunks Nope. While it seems like they are heavily inspired by the approach of @ExpansionPunks, they are also completely unrelated to us."

The tokens won't exist until we use use those 19 mints."
28,@DataNFT_ https://t.co/zbaOGmY78K
29,"@TokkimsTokins @larvalabs @NotLarvaLabs @ExpansionPunks @XpansionPhunks I can shed some light on that (xPunk dev here): We still have 19 reserve mints left (for giveaway and stuff), so there are 19 xPunks left unminted. I am not sure how the metadata was scrapped for xphunks but I presume they did not catch this."

31,"@assafmo @SecretNetwork I am so excited for this. This year already primed this, with @secretheroesnft as a first PoC and @MysticSkulls and @DomeriumLabs picking up on this. Excited for 2022."
32,"@XpansionPhunks @ElectionDayMad1 Contracts are immutable, so to change anything means deploying a new contract and therefore creating a new token (as you might know, given the ""PhunksExpansion"" contract you deployed 12 days ago)"
33,@XpansionPhunks @ElectionDayMad1 Then why not add a counter that limits the free claim to 25? Right now there is nothing stopping the owner from minting the last 2k.
34,"@ElectionDayMad1 @XpansionPhunks Something to take note of, as you are attaching your name to this: The owner of the contract has the ability to mint as many as they want for free, which is a huge red flag. https://t.co/Y7tgxYn0yy"

58,"... Then consensus was reached on the second evaluation and this was written into the blockchain, but somehow OS, our frontend and the bot picked up the events, broadcasted by the first node as well.

No idea if that works but would love feedback on that guess, to keep learning."
59,"My guess: Maybe some node evaluated the contract, came to a conclusion and broadcasted a mint transaction which included zID. Another node did the same thing, but coming to a different conclusion of which tokens were minted (we're using pseudo-randomness to mint randomly)..."
60,"The big mysterious thing here is: Where did the three events, that triggered the tools above to shout out the zombie mint, come from and where did they go to? https://t.co/REFryNco4y"
61,But looking at the contract events shows (as to be expected) three events tied to the mint transaction. Crosschecking the minted token ids (third line) matches them to the one we saw in the mint transaction... https://t.co/uLZRhCcEn5
62,"So why did OpenSea emit the token in their frontend, our webpage show the token in reveal and our minting bot post about it in #minting-and-trading? 
My first guess: All those tools listen to contract events to do their thing so maybe we had a fuckup there..."
63,"OpenSea is still showing token zID as unrevealed, which is weird on its own, as all xPunks are revealed pre mint and the metadata stored on IPFS. Querying the contract directly shows why that is: The token does not exist yet... https://t.co/yzZGnFTiTC"
64,Digging further in. First let’s have a look at the actual transaction https://t.co/wlIFYDJmC4 ... Etherscan is pretty adamant: token zID was not minted here). Checking the owner wallet confirms that: It matches 4 tokens bought before and the three minted in tx above... https://t.co/WkHODIOHku
65,"A quick check on OpenSea revealed on their platform they received 5! ExpansionPunks: The three currently shown on https://t.co/CXh4uaMZ1L and two unrevealed, where the tokenIds match the zombie tokenId (#17459, let’s call it zID)... https://t.co/d44chvAR1m"
66,"What happened: Someone minted 3 ExpansionPunks and when revealing was shown a really cool zombie (among the other two). When heading to their account page on our site, suddenly, lo and behold, there were three different xPunks ... https://t.co/jYuyTv8lSS"

77,"@Jan71592075 I tend to have this problem now and then and what helps (god knows why) is enabling 'show debug data' under the ledger eth app settings (as well as contract data / blind signing). It requires a trillion confirmations per transaction but for whatever reason, it works."
