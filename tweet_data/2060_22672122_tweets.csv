Because they need to be able to “read &amp; understand” the guidelines, she said.

I have such more consistent energy since giving up caffeine. I also almost never eat sugar or simple carbs except for rare occasions with extreme moderation."
80,"It’s been about 9 years since I gave up caffeine. 

Since then, I’ve had 3 kids within 18 months. Owned and run multiple businesses. I work out 4-6 times a week. 

I used to drink 6-8 espresso shots a day.

Coffee is delicious, but you shouldn’t need chemicals to have energy."
