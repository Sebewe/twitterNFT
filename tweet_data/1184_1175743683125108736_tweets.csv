I’d rather be classic."

I wish our brothers and sisters in Ukraine to be safe, well and resilient in these dark times.

I just smiled, nodded my head politely and said: 

""That sounds wonderful."""
6,"Project: These are rare and scarce and [insert other related synonym].

Others: FOMO! WAGMI! Moon! Lambo!

Me: *Click*"
7,"Rarity is not art.

It's a basic economic mechanism that is artificially and arbritrarily developed by profit mongers to drive market demand over supply."
8,"Dinosaur fossils are rare as well...

But that doesn't mean every Tom, Dick and Harry wants to collect them."
9,"""nvm, decided to hodl'

Since 2019 and beyond.

Perhaps people finally realizing that rarity traits aren't everything when it comes to NFTs."

Nowadays, if you're not making the headlines, you're probably doing things right."

Groupthink and WAGMI are so overrated."

15,"There is a saying in Chinese business:

做生意先做人

It means that one should know how to be a decent human being before one does business. 

None of us are perfect, but if you have “defects”, own them. 

The worst thing you can do is try to hide them."
16,@NoahAddis Beautiful works and a pleasure to have you in my personal collection ♥️

18,"Recent NFT projects are the toy capsule vending machines of the 21st century.

Except instead of a quarter, you take out a second mortgage on your home equity. https://t.co/awjeAH1BCO"
19,"I'm not only one of the NFT industry's largest collectors.

I'm also one of its biggest critics.

Rainbows and sunshine do not come out of my blowhole 🌈🌞🐳"
20,"The biggest disease facing NFTland right now isn't COVID. 

It's Irrationality.

Symptoms include insomnia, aggression, narcissism and short to long term insolvency.

Infectious, systematic and will be a hella more painful than Long COVID."
21,"Rationality is a curious thing.

1, Can't be taught.
2, Takes a while to get results.
3, Anti-climatic when expected results come in.

Always profitable but always disappointing.

Irrationality on the otherhand... just breeds more irrationality."
22,"6/6

True value is not speculative in nature. 

While 99.99% of NFTs do not reflect true value, adverse comments from mainstream are a crtique on the greed and tragedy of that noise.

We were given a hammer to build true value and not to kill it.

So let's do that."
23,"5/6

Whether you like it or not: 

We are moving towards the Metaverse.

You will own a Metaverse property.

And you will own digital assets to populate that Metaverse lifestlye.

NFT tech is the underlying technology that will assure and ensure that you actually own it."
24,"4/6

NFT technology propelled digital art to the forefront of the art world.

New creators.
New collectors.

New models of commercialization that debunked the stereotype of the ""starving artist"".

This is not noise. 
This is the innovation and democratization of value."
25,"3/6

There is so much noise in the NFT space.

A generational disruption in digital art, culture and gaming drowned out by insider trading, hype manufacturing and false idols.

And that noise continues to increase with the greed associated with it."
26,"2/6

Like the internet, NFT tech is not inherently bad. 

The internet was created to provide the seamless flow of information and ideas across the globe. 

It was not created to provide access to child pornography or animal cruelty videos.

Cute cat videos were a bonus though."
27,"1/6

It saddens me when I see comments from mainstream such as:

""Not a NFT""
""Please not a NFT""

NFT technology was created to provide true ownership and management of digital assets as we moved further towards a digital world and lifestyle."

Web 3.0 means that you can have your cake and eat it too.

Amazing job guys ♥️♥️♥️"
63,"I am not sure which part of collecting I enjoy more: 

The acquiring or the acquisition.

Sometimes the experience of supporting a creative's growth in the market is equally or more important than the eventual acquisition."

Your kindness and humility does."

My tweets might look like stream of thought, but they are actually conclusions."
82,"Opportunities for Web 3.0 exist beyond buying your next NFT. 

In a choice between going further down the rabbit hole or swimming further up the value chain, I choose the latter. 

Diversification is key."
83,"The misconception about the decentralised economics of Web 3.0 is that anyone who buys crypto or a NFT will prosper. 

Darwin’s Theory still intact for Web 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. 

A fool and their money are soon parted."
84,"2 traits lacking in NFT collectors today: 

Philosophical and Technical Comprehension.

Philosophical: What is the creator trying to convey?

Technical: How well is that manifested in their creations?

You will not find future value without a heart or a brain."
85,"I’m tired of “It’s about who you know” rather than “It’s about what you know”.
