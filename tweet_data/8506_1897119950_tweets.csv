35,@muratpak @Jason
36,@nvlcllctr @Y4Si Thanks. I think we need to educate NFT Twitter more. It's easy to see web3 as necessarily positive as it's easy to be blinded by the windfall profits.
37,"@Y4Si About the wallet, if you have its seed phrase in your custody, it one thing. But what if you don't. Also, there will certainly be a mandatory KYC to transact with applications, and you could risk 'losing yoyr social credit score' if you used 'rogue' apps."
38,@Y4Si it looks the same but is radically different at the core. It is absolute centralized control.
39,"@Y4Si I think there's a misconception about web3, to me it's not inherently good or bad, it's about logging in 'with a wallet' to 'applications'. If the wallet is not in your custody and the application is not truly 'decentralized', with the government controlling it, then"
40,"@Y4Si I agree. But the struggle is only beginning. We need people to understand that web3 is both a chance and a threat, and that they must take action."
41,"@Y4Si China is trying and shall succeed. Ban cryptos, force CBDCs and then, encourage NFTs and mint every possible piece of irl property. Soon, all property becomes digital, money becomes rationing tickets and you can be unplugged by a bureaucrat in one simple click. Absolute mf hell."
42,@tandavas 'Indie games marketplace'... they will go down like Steam.
43,@Y4Si I'm not sure to see the analogy. The need of a decentralized system stems from a *need* to combat abuse of authority. the technology to make anarchy work didn't exist. Now govts want web3 for themselves only: but centralized web3 is hell: we urgently need code to save humanity.
44,Thank you so much 🥲 https://t.co/GuDvacyCDz
45,"@tandavas Yes, especially considering mechanical watches are already useless irl. I trust my phone's time more than i do my watch's."
46,"@tandavas True, could perfectly be, i don't have answers, only questions. It could also be that we want virtual sneakers because it's a 'cool' thing we can think about now: the online version of something cool irl. Not cryptonative-cool, though."
47,I don't have a foot in the 'metaverse': why would i need the NFT of virtual sneakers? We're very early but also very early in our understanding of this stuff.
48,@velocirapteh @muratpak I'll probably try all these variants on different wallets
