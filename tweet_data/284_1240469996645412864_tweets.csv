3,Why am I awake at 3 am watching Inventing Anna TikToks I need help 😂
4,NFT TikTok be like: “POV you bought this rare gold BAYC for $180 and now it’s worth $20 million” as though anyone can buy one of the rarest items in the collection and realize value and ridiculous listing prices. Don’t listen to NFT TikTok please 😂

8,@DataNFT_ @ExpansionPunks @RooTroopNFT @EthaliensNFT @fame_ladies 1 @psychedelic_nft IRL (0.3) pass could also get you a 1000 twitter followers + lot more!
9,"@JakeBeastly @psychedelic_nft Yup, exactly - not much incentive for new buyers now especially sense the staking snapshot is over"
10,@JakeBeastly @psychedelic_nft The staking mechanic doesn't add any value to the holders except for royal gamers which only the whales will get. I guess that's why the price fell.
11,"@JakeBeastly @psychedelic_nft Yup, I track that project too! I used to own 3, cut my losses a few weeks ago."

16,"(14/🧵) As always, this thread is NFA and please DYOR! Hope y'all enjoyed! One last thing, the BB and WoW graphs are eerily similar! Time to do some digging!"
17,"(13/🧵) For projects that have recently risen to prominence (PA, NFT Worlds) the # listed quickly retracted to what it was before the great delisting. Note that both projects as it is have a very small % listed compared to the others so this retracement was not a surprise."
18,"(12/🧵) My takeaways - for older, more established projects (BAYC, MAYC, WoW ...) the # listed fell significantly (I'm guessing a some of these must be the ridiculous listing of 1 million ETH)."

35,Another strong metric for @psychedelic_nft - 92 of the last 100 trades have been profitable - ahead of @doodles @BoredApeYC (&amp; MAYC) @veefriends &amp; more! Dashboard is from @flipsfinance - it is however limited in the projects that it displays! https://t.co/Z83L86ElR7

39,@TheWearyLuddite @Beno1t_eth @CyberKongz @BossBeautiesNFT @nftworldsNFT @alienfrens @NFTMTG I think it’s high cause we minted the same day. Number has probably reduced over time im guessing.
40,"@flipsfinance is the best free user friendly nft analytics tool out there imo. Everything else is either

47,@ActedBridge0x0 @DataNFT_ great point!

58,@Denver_diehard haha! anytime :)
59,@DiscoverXnft 🤝🤝🤝
60,@Denver_diehard 🚀🚀🚀 those numbers are just for genesis btw! They're probably higher for passes and comps!
61,@DiscoverXnft taught me perhaps the most important lesson I've learned in the web3 space - build your brand first (before the influx of millions into the space) and then worry about everything else! Thank you :)
62,**consistently high
63,"@Denver_diehard Yes! But keep in mind the number is from Feb 18th. I'm sure however, it will still be &gt;90% at today's floor price. It's great to see everyone in PA winning :) so happy for the entire community!"

66,"(3/🧵) @Pixelmon (Pixelmon) - currently 53.7% of people holding Pixelmon are in profit. Nearly half the holders being at a loss is a definite negative sign for the sentiments of community. I'm sure the people who minted Kevin must be on top of the world, however! https://t.co/nTBfBe3zlz"
67,"(2/🧵) @psychedelic_nft (Psychedelics Anonymous) - not sure why this query only ran till Feb 18, however, at that point, a whopping 97.1% of PA holders were in profit! This is a huge positive sign. From the graph, we can also see this number has stayed consistently low! https://t.co/V5hHyy5Kux"
68,"(1/🧵) Another great metric to judge holder's sentiment is: % of holder's in profit. That is at a given point in time, what % of holder's are profitable based on their avg. buy in price and floor price. Thanks to ""at milkman"" for the @DuneAnalytics query. Here are some examples:"
69,@DataNFT_ lack of accountability - something we need a lot more on in web3

85,The Kevin floor is the same as the @psychedelic_nft full set floor. I don’t know what to make of this 😂🤯
86,RT @sabhyac26: (1/🧵) Sharing an insight I've found useful! Long periods of accumulation + price stability + a trusted team that is building…
87,@CourtneyHclaw @psychedelic_nft Love the sentiment :)
88,@metapital_andre @nftworldsNFT Haha I was so focused on PA I faded everything else too
89,"@lidynasty It could but WoW, PA, BB were not in the top 100 based on volume when they had their breakout."
90,@lidynasty Yeah that’s what I realized too. As a newcomer I bought into hype mints when I would’ve been much better off buying into stable projects and paying slightly more! The catalysts that propel are usually strong community activity or the team delivering or both!
91,@vnotheman 🤝

96,"(7/🧵) Of course this is not a fool proof pattern. It highly depends on the team delivering on their promises as well. It's important to be able to weed out ""stagnation"" from ""consolidation &amp; accumulation"" - by looking at intangibles (team, community, engagement etc)!"
97,(6/🧵) @RTFKTstudios (CloneX) - very high entry point during consolidation of 6-8 ETH but it follows the pattern nonetheless. https://t.co/1cFcH0x46e
98,"(5/🧵) @BossBeautiesNFT (Boss Beauties) - had a long accumulation phase too but around 0.25 ETH.  The lower the accumulation, the higher the risk &amp; reward (imo). Reached ATH of 3.4 post breakout. In a new accumulation phase centered at 2 ETH! https://t.co/GiUZRhvT9d"
99,(4/🧵) @worldofwomennft (WoW) - they had one the THE longest periods of accumulation I've seen - giving everyone plenty of time to enter! The price was stable around 2.5 - 3 ETH all the way from Sept - Dec despite low volume. https://t.co/AJo3NOlq17
