0,"In an increasingly centralized world where the main infrastructure providers (aws, google cloud) also owns the main forms of distribution (search, YouTube, twitch) conflicts of interest are going to arise. Services giving users a say via crypto governance is a potential solution. https://t.co/XcEzWckTuO"
1,"The true price of having a handful of companies control your entire digital life and infrastructure only becomes obvious when a war, a hack, politics, a policy change, mistake or natural disaster cuts you off. By the end of the 2020s more people will appreciate this fact."

10,"@drawks Basically this plus verified audits, on chain transaction data and people pledging collateral or vouching reputation that this is a legit contract. Again, this isn’t  meant to be perfect or a substitute for doing due diligence."
11,"@drawks Non technical people aren’t going to read code before performing a transaction and even if they did, it’s likely that a subtle vulnerability could be concealed. No system is going to be perfect but I think we can do a lot better than we have today."

13,@godsflaw Awesome! Would love to hear more when you do. Who are you currently using and how do you feel about the pricing fireblocks offers?
14,"Has anyone following me worked with fireblocks? If so, I’d love to hear from you about what you liked and didn’t like about the experience? This is unrelated to my work at coinbase."
15,@scottshapiro They should display hexagon images for NFT holders. Make it slightly more expensive to spoof these accounts.

27,"@AnettRolikova Good advise. Here is a tool which helps with this. I've decided to delete all my tweets over a year old and have them auto delete after 12 months going forward. I do this because I prefer my social media presence to be ephemeral.

28,I believe the notion of a corporate sanctioned and social media enforced authentic self is incredibly boring in an age where it's so easy to assume different personas. I instead would urge people to maintain a private life outside of work and purge all social media regularly.
29,"One thing I never liked about working at Facebook was the notion that I was meant to bring my “authentic” self to work. This felt coercive in a similar way to my experiences going to a Catholic school in 🇮🇪. A demand not only on my time but also my soul.

39,@DanGrover 100% agreed. They are gonna have to do this very quickly. Crypto is a very big potential threat that’s going to be hard to counter once some of its rough edges get fixed.
40,"@DanGrover The past 10y have allowed web2 companies to grow revenue and distribution massively on the backs of creators by treating their work as a fungible cheap commodity. Regardless of web3, this trend is being reversed, people are realizing that quality costs money &amp; is worth paying for"

44,@andy_matuschak @tnorthcutt I can imagine a lot of people not wanting to be in their 30s living in shared housing in the Bay Area. The better play if you wanted to do something like this would be to get a remote job that pays 85%-90% of that salary working from a lower cost of living area.
45,"@andy_matuschak Well, the pattern I’ve seen is people wanting to have a house with kids in the Bay Area. At that point you enter a new tier of expenses and discomfort."
46,@andy_matuschak The answer for many is likely they purchased a home in the Bay Area and now have a very expensive mortgage to pay.
