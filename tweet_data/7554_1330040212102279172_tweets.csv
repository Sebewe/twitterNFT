5,"@iamDCinvestor Kevin becoming a thing is a direct result of people justifying their 3 ETH failed investment and recycling it to give it value again. I mean, you can sell air if the marketing is good enough."
6,@DrDestructoid My cat passed away 9 years ago and I still think about her. Although the pain won't fully go away it does get easier and the good memories will always warm your heart. Sorry for your loss.

53,There are legit projects out there like @HPPRSNFT and @Cryptoon_Goonz (to name a few) that deserve a 4 ETH floor. But the NFT community prefers shitty hype artwork like Mfers and Pixelmon (Kevin). Like wtf?!?! Its no wonder normal people think we're dumb as hell🤦🏻‍♂️🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/KxVgfupd4N

68,I'm glad Binance made the choice not to block Russian accounts. Why should Russian people suffer for the actions of their leader. Lots of Russians are against this invasion too.
