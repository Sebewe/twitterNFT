74,@CirrusNFT Outstanding !
75,@ePluribusETH @truth But the mod and I quote favor more people that are active. - something like that gives me an uncomfortable feeling . I still hold my delisted 7 Illuminatis.  Active or not there shouldn’t be. Also i wasn’t an inactive guy. I jsut wasn’t in the tavern calls due to being overseas.
76,@ePluribusETH @truth Thanks
77,@Lardacious Let’s say needed a break from it. Plus the alpha was nice but I’m too much of a Degen and Need sometimes a break
78,@Lardacious If you weren’t there for the convo I head with allsee than yea you are not going to understand
79,@Lardacious Actually was stupid and could have been avoided. Nothing serious but apparently there are more favored under the favored if you are more active. Unfortunately I can’t spend 24\7 on discord

95,@STRZA24 Yes would love a lot of input in this thread. It’s good to know and is exciting to see where this is all heading. All the different views is exciting to read.
96,@jeffreydcleary 👍 Well if everyone flips soon you’ll be out of business. Don’t get me wrong I flip. But how sustainable is it? My whole point of this thread is - where will the new nft space go. What you know now will be obsolete! If you know where it’s heading you are gonna be a happy camper
97,@STRZA24 I agree but it’s all short term right ! Like what’s the real utility atm ?
98,"I have no doubt nfts will be the everyday thing in a couple of years. 

But now it’s a soup of mess. Most projects are adding alpha and wl calls as a main utility. Does that seem sustainable? 

How many alpha threads do we need? 

I think it’s time 2 think outside the 📦"
99,Do we really need another metaverse or a p2e somewhere in the roadmap ?
