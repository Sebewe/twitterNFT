23,@riv8if I’m inclined to agree the only thing with DCL that puts me off is the strain it puts on one’s computer and the instability/unpredictable framerate issues. Hoping they sort that out because besides that I do love it. I haven’t played with Sandbox yet though as I’m OSX based.

63,@NudeYogaGirl Unfortunately happens way too often in our space :/ Get-rich-quick projects only serve the greedy and selfish whilst at the same time decrease the trust factor of NFT projects in the longterm. Makes us look bad :/ Makes me nervous to release my own next month -.-
64,@NudeYogaGirl Same. I think the only time it’s acceptable in this space is when a project owner takes a large portion of the profit sales and spends it on NFTs AGAINST the plan layed out pre-sellout. But even then it’s subjective. (Eg saying all profits will go to community then buying apes)
