4,"""bob"" the word for a small tail, a common nickname in English speaking places and all around a very nice &lt;round&gt; sound - bob. Tigerbob. And there you have it. A tiger thing. My tiger thing. Tigerbob. Tigerbob shared with you. My tiger shared with you. - @grelysian https://t.co/wnYnsCyZTG"
5,"but why tiger + bob? Well, firstly, I associated with the term ""bob"" as endearing definition of a ""thing"" specifically a ""character"" of iteration. I found this association from @eBoyArts blockbob @eboyblockbob designs. (I asked permission before adding bob to tiger -bob)👍 https://t.co/SLYNJEj1cw"
6,"My first tiger design was based on a Korean rendition of the tiger. The eyes were slits for quite some time, but have that signature “soft boiled egg” shape. round, dilated eyeballs began to be the norm beginning end of 2020. This is the essential look of tigerbob today. https://t.co/oS4rjHToga"
7,"🐯tigerbob proof of concept🐯 I have been drawing &amp; tattooing big cats, specifically tigers, in a similar 3/4 view since 2018. I was inspired by traditional Americana tattoo designs &amp; Japanese, Chinese, and Korean fine art. I connected with the tiger. It pushed me to tattooing. https://t.co/qihsuDePiU"
