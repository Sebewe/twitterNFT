64,"Same is true of @larvalabs (Crypto Punks) where top 10 own 20% of supply, top 100 own 47%.

And the transaction volume isn't discounted for sales between top holders. 

I don't understand what comes next but I do know 2022 is going to be interesting. 

Have a good weekend all :)"
65,Trying to model what happens is tricky. The traditional art market also has this conundrum but large portions of major artists works are held by museums who are far more likely to “HODL”.
66,What happens when some of these sellers start to dump some of their apes? The top 10 wallets alone hold ~ the amount of apes which have traded in the last 30 days &amp;&amp; these this has been one of the most active periods.
67,"775 Bored Ape sales over last 30 days 

&amp;&amp; these major wallets have been accruing, not dumping apes recently."
68,"Take @BoredApeYC:
Top wallet (@dingalingts) holds 105 apes, 1.1% 
10 wallets own 710 apes, 7.1%
50 wallets own 1453 apes, 14.5%
100 wallets own 1900 apes, 19%
500 wallets own 3553 apes, 35.5%"
69,I’ve been trying to understand bluechip NFT projects (e.g. @BoredApeYC or @larvalabs ) better and I now understand them even less. Here is a little thread 🧵 on this:

85,@yoitszachtaylor so bullish on this. Awesome to see these incentives put in place by @DecentralGames ! 🎉

88,@hpills01 I'm sure there is scope for both. I don't know how to regulate crypto without taking away too much of the decentral freedoms it benefits from &amp; is so popular for. Applying a FCA like model may be an interesting solution. This could be layered with an int. governing body.
89,@jacksondame @ensdomains negotiation levels 🔥 💯
90,Rebirthing forgotten celebrities careers is my favourite comedic side effect of NFTs.
91,5. Bringing this back around to @MarcoGrassi_ - the response from the community has been insane. This is why I love Web3.
92,4. And for those who say governments aren’t fit for purpose when it comes to regulating Crypto but also say the future is Crypto… I’m super excited to learn more but I don’t know what the answer to this is yet. #crypto
93,"3. Who should set the rules for the chain? GOVERNMENTS!!!! This is where regulation is needed. If Crypto is to move forwards, it can’t continue to consistently fulfil its reputation of being the “Wild West” of finance. #regulation"
94,"2. When people choose to interact with a Blockchain, they sign up for the positives and the negatives, OpenSea shouldn’t be the moderator of this, the chain itself should manage this. #blockchain"
95,"1. He did nothing wrong. If a transaction's reversible, then it's fair to freeze the item, but here it isn’t. How am I supposed to have faith buying NFTs going forwards if they could be frozen just like this… Undermining the most basic level of trust is categorically not ok.#nft"
96,"Decentrality is irrelevant, @opensea is centralised and that’s just how it is - in fact, there are many benefits to this. That said, if I was in @MarcoGrassi_'s shoes, I would feel very aggrieved. Here’s why IMO 🧵: https://t.co/kPGuHpcVgh"
97,I have never been more excited for an album…. ever: Flume - 2022 https://t.co/MfHrOTesMM @flumemusic #2022
98,@blockupation @DecentralGames I couldn't agree more on this point - I'm actually going to write a tweet about this. Being able to tell one of my players that they now had a Level 3 wearable was such an awesome feeling.
99,".@sunflowerfarmz destroying @0xPolygon has taught me there is a pain worse than stubbing your toe. I know nothings perfect but somethings got to be done about this 😭
