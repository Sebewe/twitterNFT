50,"@FuZzyy_14 @potrepka Oh I can't imagine it was easy to decide to price them that high. I'm just feeling for everyone who got listed and suddenly priced out, imo price should've been announced farther away from mint to allow preparation, but I have no idea of everything they have to deal with so yeah"
51,"@potrepka And I respect them for allocating A LOT of public sale to an allow list for this reason. I'm not on the list, but I have a feeling that a lot of people who were really excited to finally have a chance at joining the cool cats community were suddenly priced out once again today."
52,"@potrepka Not trying to fud cool cats and I still like the project &amp; would likely get one if I ever could, but there's better ways this could've been done. Even announcing the mint price more than 2 weeks ahead of launch, if they were set on 0.5 the whole time, would've been a better move"
53,"@potrepka ""smaller wallets"" to prepare"
54,"@potrepka more manageable cost, and the fact that they went out and gave out these allow list spots to members of smaller projects full of members with ""smaller wallets."" Also the fact that the price wasn't announced until 2 weeks before drop, not allowing people with those"
55,"@potrepka A premium is one thing, but half an eth is on another level. Paying that much for a drop of a 1/1 artwork is a lot different than paying (at the time) $1500 for 1/20000. Also to add in that this drop was advertised as a way for people to enter the cool cats community at lower and"
