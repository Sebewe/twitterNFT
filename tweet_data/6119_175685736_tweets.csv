When I came here first, I was a different person: A young CRA looking to climb the corp ladder. Took me a month to earn more than my previous boss thanks to NFTs, and another month to understand I wasn't cut for that 9/5 crap. (3)"
53,"I'm grateful for all the people I had the chance to meet and connect with, we'll keep in touch and I'll be visiting you soon. Everything we started building together, it's still my priority (like, if I told ya #NFTMilano2022 what would you say?) and I'm dedicated to go on (2)"
54,"gm.
Last 20ish days in Milan, before going back to my hometown to enjoy some tranquillity.
This is temporary as I'll be back next fall, I don't have any urgency to be here now and I'll be visiting on a monthly basis.
I'll take some time to focus on building and on my health. (1)"
