10,"@Ed_Balloon No what I can’t is that  I posted this yesterday morning asking if we could raise money for them… I have no retweets, likes or comments. I didn’t tag anyone. But I’m glad I didn’t support them with their 1million plus fundraiser either."

29,@Ed_Balloon I’m West Coast and love Jay but the cultural impact Pac made is why he has museums in his honor… two at this point. Jay would never put the culture on his chest as publicly as Pac did. He tells us that we are past kneeling so he can have an owners box at mid field.
