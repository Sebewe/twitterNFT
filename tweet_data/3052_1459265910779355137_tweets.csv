4,"@Degentraland @doodles Big miss on their part. The community was super hyped and def expected more from this top-notch crew. Agreed as a brand, we gotta rep way better than small logos on generic colors. I hope they run with the feedback and do better next run"

11,"Amazing how not aping into a new project every couple of days feels like years in the NFT space. Was searching for a rare in a few projects like Fomo Mofo, CryptoMories, and FoxFam...but couldn't find what I was looking for. Ended up with an egg instead @coolcatsnft #coolpets 😻 https://t.co/sPyVUXyHnq"

20,@kellenlee_eth @fracionadoo @FangGangNFT I almost joined Rainbow Gang too! Loving how chill that one is.
21,@Jford140 @FangGangNFT Yoo what face is that? I think my PxLfang came out just like it

27,"@MetalMartianMan Great area, and great place to capture nature. Beautiful during each season of the year, and I love taking day trips to Windham and Hunter for skiing."
28,Fast-Chat on Discord reminds me of playing Space Invaders when the Aliens get close. I honestly don't see the point of even grinding WL for these if Level 50 isn't enough. Props to people with that much attention span https://t.co/ghoDAmvkGV

35,2/2:same ideas that Coffeedan portrays in his book. Positivity and humor is what Fred Flinstone was all about. I try to live by that same mantra and couldn't picture a more perfect Spesh for me.
36,"1/2:This @CoolmanUniverse takes me back to my favorite childhood show...The Flinstones. Fred was always one of my favorite characters, clueless yet pure of heart. You can kind of see that on this fella, the brow shows his pique interest and the ""ur special"" background adds to the https://t.co/RhdPHBmb5s"
37,Entered about 10 raffles and contests for #coolpets and no luck! Where do we think secondary will open up at? 1-2 eth? @coolcatsnft
38,Getting a #NFTs WL these days is either The Hunger Games or Playing the Powerball
39,"Sweet, thanks for the replies everyone. I'll try to do it via pixlr or on my phone first to see how it comes out. If I need help with a design I'll also def reach out!"

50,"I was getting ready to buy a @coolcatsnft today, pulled together close to 12 eth but their spaces sent the floor flying. Any suggestions on a rare I can get instead?"
51,"If you had a choice, would you acquire an ultra rare in a project that's undervalued or floor in a blue chip?"
52,"RT @DiscoverXnft: “I have 5 Eth, What floor should I sweep?” https://t.co/6pPYIeW8R9"
53,@Z3TNFT @robotosNFT Cleeean Boto! Love it dude. welcome to the fam
54,@frostedfrakes $BTC here to great you in the dumps
55,"@BobbyPeru24 At least they set a date. The mod team for Mona has been saying ""party soon"" for the last 36 hours trying to build up hype and tagging Paris Hilton to get her onboard."
56,"1 step forward, 2 steps backward. Anyone who still says this is a bull market is kidding themselves. Buckle up, we're just getting started."
57,Monaverse with the longest reveal in NFT history so far lmao

60,"Vaulted all of my key hold NFTs. Definitely learned a lot. Some Huge wins, some big Ls. Overall mantra, invest in Blue Chips and invest in tools to give you that edge. Have about 10eth left to play with before I'll have to make trades for liquidity. Good time to shop?"
61,Added a couple of @stapleverse FEEDs! Excited to see how the burning mechanism of the project works 💩🕊️🥨 #STAPLEVERSE https://t.co/m52Pwt2WrA

66,@DegenArtClub I love how clean mine looks. Thanks again! https://t.co/dg93opilmm
67,I've always been a fan of clean pfps in a collection. When they have a lot of traits with wild details sometimes there's too much going on.
68,@morpheu55 I hope it was actual people and not bots because that Discord got joined faster than an Xbox going on sale for the Holidays lmao
69,"@VinnieHager Dude, your artwork is really amazing, and I'm not trying to blow smoke up your 🍑. When I first think of NFTs and art the name that comes to mind is Fidenza, but your work in my mind really sets a new standard."
70,"@Simply_Ed_ @VinnieHager @tobylasso @WeatheReportNFT Damn your doodle with the letters looks so sick! When you’re no longer back logged if you could help me with my doodle to look as awesome as yours so I could combine with my letters too, I’d be forever grateful!"
71,RT @tobylasso: Anyone that holds a @VinnieHager ‘Letter’ will be whitelisted for @WeatheReportNFT ☔️🤝💌

81,To incubate or not...that is the question????? https://t.co/1Ch9ib8h8T
82,@jrcashhh I’m right there with ya bro. Heavy into $RON farming in the AXS-WETH pool and the Impermanent Loss could have easily been used for another Doodle. Guess we’ll see what wrapped ronin is eventually worth…
83,Looking to mint a few new projects. Was lucky enough to get WL for @stapleverse and @themetroverse but looking for advice on some more upcoming projects
84,Been busy last couple of days wrapping up my job before I head off to a new and exciting one which will allow me to get even further into the NFT space
