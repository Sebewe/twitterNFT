23,"@CryptoMories @sabet If others are ""inspired"" by your ideas, then you're winning.  Why fight?

@BoredApeYC could pay lawyers and shut down the clones.  They don't, they're smart.  Copycats =  validation and envy.

Web3 empowers the people.  The market will react.  Sue actual scammers, forgive others."
24,"Curious how the art community reacts to the delisting of @CryptoMories by @sabet...

What I've gathered so far (correct me):

🧑‍⚖️ Sabet sought damages from CM (refused)
🧑‍⚖️ Sabet filed a DMCA to OS
🧑‍⚖️ OS obliged, delisting CM
🧑‍⚖️ TokyoPunks floor is ⤵️, CM ⤴️
