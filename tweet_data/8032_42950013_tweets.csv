34,@Siddharth_Vaze Totally agree. In situations where folks aren’t capable of unlearning and trying new things finding others who are far from the problem and can get close to it with fresh eyes is key.
35,@morgoozie I feel you. Looking at my 8-month old with everything going on is well.. scary. And scary isn’t a big enough word or emotion to label it.

65,@BloggerSaurabh @github @code @Microsoft @satyanadella Connecting with people is in itself a real world benefit and that already exists. My partner @iGrowBrands is using @MetaQuestVR to be present with his father while he undergoes chemotherapy due to limiting hospital visitation policies. The metaverse is about enabling connection.
66,"@BloggerSaurabh The metaverse is creating many new jobs, much more information (content), and the many platforms (owned by Microsoft and their competitors) can benefit from global adoption to these platforms. Many metaverse experiences work well on 3g I.e @cryptovoxels there’s many layers here"
67,"@BloggerSaurabh Well - I can see many other ways India and other countries can contribute aside from what you mentioned. Engineering, design, 3d art creation, content support, usage - India has amazing talented people who can fuel this in more ways than just 5g adoption or infrastructure."
68,"@BloggerSaurabh @github @code @Microsoft I think the metaverse infrastructure is key but not interdependent on @Microsoft benefiting from this acquisition. They cemented a new pillar in entertainment, gaming, &amp; community with this acquisition. @satyanadella is brilliant &amp; has transformed Microsoft to be relevant again."
69,"@BloggerSaurabh Take the acquisition of @github or releasing @code as free to users. The metrics this unlocked for Microsoft we’re vast. Including:

Reduction of recruiting fees
Increased market share 
Increased usage of cloud services 

@Microsoft is skating to where the puck is. #winning"
70,"@BloggerSaurabh Thanks for tuning in - appreciate the kind words and curiosity. I believe the network effects of this acquisition will affect multiple lines of business. By acquiring humans attention (dau,mau, time spent on platforms) the returns will be exponential."

72,"This is why I’d argue Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard is proof that they have a deep understanding of the metrics of immersion &amp; know how to “hack” the attention graph.

Making this acquisition a calculated risk vs. a bold bet.

This is why Microsoft is great at Monopoly."
73,"What’s the one thing in common w/these individuals pursuing Web 3.0 endeavors?

They’re focused on getting &amp; retaining their core audience's attention.

Just like Microsoft is by monetizing their audience's LTV &amp; attention through the communities they engage in."
74,"“Where the attention goes, the energy flows.”

All kinds of energy is flowing in the Web 3.0 direction i.e. the president of @Unilever is moving on to pursue an investment fund focused on technology megatrends, and a former exec of YouTube Gaming is joining @polygonstudios. 🌐"
75,"In the game of Monopoly the more space you snag early on, the wealthier you become over time.

Companies like Microsoft that are staking their claim in the metaverse early on (through acquisitions like this) are poising themselves to “win” in the long-run at the game of Monopoly."
76,"Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella seems to agree with my theory. The metaverse is about connecting w/humans in a digital first medium.

Their press release confirms they're excited to put players &amp; creators first. Prioritizing safety/inclusion/accessibility.

https://t.co/1rlX2QnDtU"
77,"You’ve probably read a few things about Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. 💰

A lot of people think this is just power play to squash the competition.

Here’s why I’d argue it’s a calculated risk and an example of being great at the game of Monopoly. 🧵"
