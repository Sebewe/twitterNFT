41,"@MCM0NEY @metastash @larvalabs Substrata figured out a way to fix the bones an let people upload their own VRM, but they’re working with a better initial skeleton and a dedicated client (might not work on web?), and we can’t let anyone upload VRM right now for a few reasons moderating, existing VOX market, etc"
42,"@MCM0NEY @metastash Trying desperately, but they made near impossible. Twisted VRM bones. Want us to re-host files… &amp; make our own security I guess?? 

Another way is chop each to 9 VOX pieces w/copies, airdrop 1st matching set, but they’re not going to. I may have to make Pheebits. ;)

58,@imkingroach @cryptovoxels I think 6th would have to refresh page again after 5th leaves.. but I will work on this and to make it more obvious how many are in a Space and what/when/how to join. Now you’re making me think about those video game “lobbies”.
59,"@imkingroach @cryptovoxels We are one of the only metaverses that provides free minting to Public collections, free Spaces to showcase skills, and *now* free limited multiplayer Spaces for even more ease to make this on-ramp easier."
60,"@imkingroach @cryptovoxels Before I joined CV team &amp; was a player, I too really wanted to afford land as well. I was mad at all the speculator flippers making this harder for me. However, I did wearable and build commissions for others to be able to afford it, and have since understood the speculators too."
61,"@imkingroach @cryptovoxels I’m sorry - we have to meet both the overlap of the user &amp; business goals, and what you’re saying is not overall beneficial to either.

It costs $0 to post a URL link of your Space to your networks, my friend."
62,@imkingroach @cryptovoxels You can now download the Space’s JSON file and then upload it to a Parcel of the same size when you’re ready for in-world land.
63,"@JWXLgallery @cryptovoxels Wow, appreciate it! 🧚‍♀️"
64,"@imkingroach @cryptovoxels We are a team of about 10 people, currently taking no outside investment, so we rely on land sales for our server costs and R&amp;D.

&amp; In comparison to other metaverses such as NFTWorlds, Decentraland, and TheSandbox, we are currently  more affordable."
65,"@imkingroach @cryptovoxels Parcels in-world used to be uncapped land, Spaces uncapped but 1 person.

Now Parcels in-world are 70,000 capped land (10% already sold), and Spaces uncapped with 5 people. 

Parcels and Spaces with same unlimited people would not incentivize anyone to buy land, so no, no plans."
66,"@imkingroach @cryptovoxels I believe the 5 people would not see the 6th user.

They are not sectioned into groups of 5 - it's only 5 total that can interact."
