I'm bullish on NFT games and their medium/long term potential. I think ownership of digital assets is just a small part of it. Overall, to me, it enables a new level of community ownership in games.

Hopefully Champions Ascension becomes one of those games!"
4,"game publisher and their goal with Champions Ascension is to create a AAA game, and that takes money.

I will say, that building AAA game isn't the same as building a good game.

Take @SupergiantGames for example. Hades was not a AAA game but is easily one of the best games👇 https://t.co/BFqh6FftPv"
