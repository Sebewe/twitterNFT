12,"@SweetBeanDazz I don't even bother.

They can figure out if it's something they want to do by themselves. The conversations I have on what I do in the space should be enough for a person to tell if it's something they want to do or not."
13,@crispylines I don't want to live on this planet anymore.

44,@_Matthew316 The potential utilities of projects built on Web3 are limitless. The most popular utility at the moment is most likely P2E or Membership Passes.
45,People should be buying #NFT for the utility or the actual art to USE it... not to make some quick flip like a dude selling Jordans. I mean there's nothing wrong with that... but you should be building not flipping if you want to have longevity.

#YellowFollowYellow
#expansionpunks 
#0xApes 
#0xapeFollow0xApe
#0xazuki
#BeanFollowBean

By following and supporting each others tweets we can expand our community, grow, and learn together."
96,"I feel I've said mostly everything on my mind so in conclusion:

1. Be safe
2. Do your research
3. Network with others
4. Spread kindness
5. Don't support projects blindly
6. Don't shill... spread the message instead
7. Have fun
8. Don't overinvest 
9. Never stop grinding"
97,"Spread love and joy to others in regards to your 0x. Dont shove it down their throats. Dont force people to buy in. Show them why you love your 0x. Show them the community being created 
Talk to others and share experiences. Nobody likes that guy who just shills images and links."
98,Over the past hour I've given my thoughts and experiences in this thread with these expansion/0x projects but have yet to even break the surface. As a community and a holder it's our duty to spread knowledge and kindness towards others in a similar fashion as this.
99,Something that I would personally like to see is the different expansion/ 0x projects come together and agree that as a whole we are creating an amazing space for new buyers/ smaller wallets. Maybe showing good faith towards each other in some type of way.
