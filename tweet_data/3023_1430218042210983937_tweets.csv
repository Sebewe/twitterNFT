9,@jakethedegen WHAT?!  This is amazing.
10,@ghost_wrk I’m excited to add another of your epic-scale pieces to my collection. So easy to get lost in this one!
11,"@KeyboardMonkey3 Amazing, congrats!"
12,"Had 150k $MAGIC unlock this week from the genesis mine. Did I restake all of this in the new Atlas Mine?  

No.

I bought even more and locked all of it up for the maximum 12 months. Hard to express how impressed I am with the @Treasure_DAO team. They're simply built different. https://t.co/GcDI8B6Dx7"

I had trouble minting with my hardware wallet, so I had to transfer my Noun to a hot wallet to participate in the presale. Pretty ironic considering his accessory! https://t.co/QyVMot9D5L"
23,@draxtoshi @bonafidehan @tylerxhobbs Haha not to worry! Will be having it adjusted soon and will post another pic.
24,@lphaCentauriKid Sure thing!  I’m going to have them properly aligned first and then I’ll take one.
25,"Thanks for all the amazing feedback!  For anyone new to the collection, it's called FIDENZA. Gotta love Twitter typos 🤦‍♂️"
26,"@Jeff_Frost @bonafidehan @tylerxhobbs Thanks Jeff!  It's possible to generate an extremely hi res image from any Art Blocks project since it's just code running in a browser. In this case, however, the artist has an option to purchase one signed print per NFT. Details are here: https://t.co/Vjp6n8Nj2y"
27,"@TaipeiCityEth @bonafidehan @tylerxhobbs Thanks!  They are 40"" x 48"" prints, 3/4"" wood frame with a smooth, matte black finish, 4"" white mat, museum glass (was hard to find a framer who would do this instead of acrylic)"
28,"I finally got my Fidenda prints framed, and I'm so happy with the results.

Thanks @bonafidehan for helping me put this collection together, and of course @tylerxhobbs for creating these amazing works of art! https://t.co/iZn13CCUEL"

I was truly shocked. I can't say I would've done the same, but this cat took a chance on me today and taught me that it's still ok to trust when you feel it's right.

Consider this one vaulted and then some."

It's a special thing when someone you've never met puts their trust in you. @mooncat2878 has no idea who I am outside of my anon account, yet he sent me a 1/10 XCOPY today, fully trusting that I would hold up my end of the  deal: https://t.co/TxtkRJGnov"
