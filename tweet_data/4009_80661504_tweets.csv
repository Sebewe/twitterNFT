10,@Degentraland @doodles @BoredApeYC But I am noticing a lot less talk about being “the next BAYC” which is great for the space. More focus on innovation and pushing the boundaries/potential of NFTs rather than tryna be “the next BAYC” reminds me of Kobe saying “I don’t wanna be the next Jordan I only wanna be Kobe”
11,"@Degentraland @doodles @BoredApeYC Love your thorough explanation, and really enjoyed reading it. A lot of great information from this thread so thank you for that! As a holder of none of these NFTs mentioned 🥲, I do agree with your take and your 3 criteria! *Diverse rev streams* &amp; focusing on Utility &amp; Community"
