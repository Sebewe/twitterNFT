8,When it comes to brutality there are too many people who wouldn't be too different from Putin if he were given uncontrolled power too
9,This fuckin' idiot doesn't even know it's a crime to share photos and identity information of surrendering soldiers.  Maybe these people don't want to be a part of this war too and they were sent there by force and chose to surrender https://t.co/9z0SbHC07D

1-) Humans need chaos 
2-) Humans need to feel important and need a meaning and a purpose in their lives

24,"In the world we live in right now, although I was uncomfortable with this situation when I was 15-16, now I understand it is very important for Turkey to be ultra-nationalist, especially because of its closeness to the Middle East."
25,"We need to “protect” our countries because of the nationalism itself. Imagine a world without such a concept… 
It’s just an utopia of course and it can only work in theory like socialism"
26,I can't believe they invented the concept of “nationalism” and made innocent people with families hate and kill each other for centuries…
27,@hexeract01 Good luck askim 👼🏻
28,"@0x22_ @vjosart1 Sure I can totally understand. The only thing I am saying is this; If men or women(?) want to fight for their country and are willing to die, they should do it.  

And men who are afraid to fight or don't even know how to hold a gun should be allowed to go."

30,"Everyone has their own life and conscience, but I can’t believe that there are people who still tweet about their own NFT projects and do not say a word about the war.
And this includes respected artists with a large audience too."
31,@vjosart1 Sadly they are also supporting the patriarchal system themselves. So they are creating the war and they are dying for it. It’s a vicious cycle and as you can see from the replies they are okay with it. I don’t want to interfere👌🏻
32,@Thorwagmirok Definitely…
33,@_moodcup Sure exactly
34,"@ValhallaaCrypto @oguzdogruart It’s military’s duty to protect the country, If civilians want to join with their own will too, good for us.
If you are too keen on dying in wars of totalitarian regimes and political bullshit and egos, you can go, not me and the man I love. Thank you🙏🏻"
35,"@_moodcup Any man who actually thinks this way and support this situation can go to a war and die, i really don’t care but still feel bad for the rest of course…"
36,"No, our friends sitting in front of a computer say they have to go to war 🙏🏻 https://t.co/hRUjAKkxyx"
37,The responses to this tweet are just truly incredible. I realized that the only thing I have in common with my followers is Crypto and NFT.
38,"@0xTarish After I saw the responses under this tweet, I still feel bad for the men who are scared to go into a war and forced to be part of it, but other than that I realized these guys deserve this 🙏🏻"
39,@LUCIFERIO77 So they couldn’t even go with their own military for 24 hours and they’re going to make a 18 year old civil (that doesn’t want to and to afraid to fight) fight for them and you are supporting this hahah
40,@Ivan_C_Cabrera I think you're having a little trouble understanding. You may be doing this voluntarily and the topic here is you can't force men who don't want to and are afraid to do it. Good luck to you 👍🏻
41,"@oguzdogruart Maybe because of the vicious circle created by men like you. In 2022, why would I get military training? It is easy to hooliganize and arm the ignorant masses and make them fight over nationalism. Personally I’m not going to let anyone I love fight in a war like this ever"
42,"@Ivan_C_Cabrera Why don’t you go and join the military? 
I feel like talking from behind your screen is not as hard as surviving in a real war =^.^="
43,"@oguzdogruart No, of course they should send all the men to die in a war over the ego problems of just one man between 18 to 60 by force… 
Men who want to fight for their country will already join"
44,We talk about women's rights and now is the time to do the same for men. No man should be forced to fight for his life against his will. https://t.co/xov0bUCi3X
