33,"I urge everyone to take a step back today from self promotion and to sit with this. 

Acknowledge and be grateful for the privilege you may have in basic safety and stability."
34,We hope for the deescalation of hostilities and safety for all people caught in conflict. May all our community members stay safe during this time. 💙💛
35,"As DAOs enable more global cooperation, they make the world smaller. We are no longer so far removed from the faces of foreign strife. These are our friends, colleagues, and contributors."
36,"Today one of orca's core community members had to take a step back due to his position within the military. 

He will now be pulled toward an uncertain conflict and can no longer continue the amazing work he's been doing within our digital world."
