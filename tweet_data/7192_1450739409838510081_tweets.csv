82,"Last point, Doodles collab? Not only being an official derivative but @evankeast, cofounder of doodles, uses his noodle as his pfp and has talked about his desire for merch collab. This is an awesome, affordable entry to the Doodles community for some who can't pay 10eth+. 5/ https://t.co/yZ8zdySFvV"
83,"The team is great. They're hard at work on new Noodles merch, a new website to showcase it, and frames to physically show off the Noodles ( next week). They receive direct royalties off Noodles so they are incentivized to really grow the project and bring the community to life 4/"
84,"Next, look how cute! Noodles are awesome. This is a fun, meme art, derivative play. No serious concerns about future utility blue chip roadmap. Aliens, verified, knife, variety of traits to connect with.  Something sweet to collect with a few exciting developments in the works 3/ https://t.co/NGq5PwK4hA"
85,"Now, there will be no more official derivatives out of Doodles. That makes Noodles 1 of 2 (Pukenza the other) and Noodles the only official pfp derivative.
