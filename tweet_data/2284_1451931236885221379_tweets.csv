75,"@boop Honestly, it was clearly stated multiple wallets would be clipped from the list if found. Look at it from IF’s angle, two wallets same IP address, there is no way for them to 100% know that your case is true. I’m sorry this happened but it’s just the way it goes.."

91,Give artists what they deserve and treat them with respect. In general but also when bringing them onto a team for a project.
92,So many good projects fell so hard due to trying to take advantage of their communities by charging such a high mint price. It is just so obvious what projects are good and which ones are flat out cash grabs. These cash grabs are polluting our space
93,"Have been pretty quiet lately on here but I’ve been paying close attention. This space is crazy and changes so quickly everyday. My advice to both NFT collectors as well as creators, don’t let greed get in the way of the Web3 WE are building."
