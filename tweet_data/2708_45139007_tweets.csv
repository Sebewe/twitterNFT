14,"Fijn dat naast @sywert die kneus van een @bdamme ook eindelijk eens wordt aangepakt. 

Hoeveel “ondernemers accolades” die man heeft gehad van vooraanstaanden zonder ook maar iets te bewerkstelligen heeft me altijd gefascineerd.

Veel mooi gepraat. Stiekem altijd een boef. Doei!"

21,@ericchai0316 @Treasure_DAO easy quest??
22,@RealAdamBraatz @0xjoer @nnimrodd @SmolBrainsNFT Lol
23,@greenheapXBT @0xjoer lol yeah everyone is a scammer
24,@btc_mix so that JC guy did what? Got contracted by projects that turned out to be rugs? haha
25,@JavierAng_ lol
26,@greenheapXBT haha ngmi buddy
27,@nnimrodd @SmolBrainsNFT why? he was a contractor who got paid by projects that turned out to be rugs.
28,"@NFTethics &gt; @zachxbt's biggest argument starts with ""I don't know..."" and ends with a question mark.

The only thing he has now ""showed"", is that an FE/UI contractor (not part of the team) worked for and got paid by a rug."
29,"@zachxbt So your biggest argument starts with ""I don't know..."" and ends with a question mark.

I agree it's necessary to call out (slow) rugs as they hurt the space, but the only thing you did now was to show that a FE/UI contractor (not part of the team) worked for and got paid by a rug"
30,"@MarkMagnuson @DruRly @tomosman @ShinyObjectSC yes, Tom!"
31,@beaniemaxi check @Treasure_DAO's Bridgeworld
32,@KeyboardMonkey3 @ThinkingDefi_ @banterlytics @zachxbt @jc_1917 agree
33,"@KeyboardMonkey3 @banterlytics @zachxbt @jc_1917 still, if someone like Zach, who I think is interested in this space, wants to see the space succeed, be mindful of your words"
34,"@KeyboardMonkey3 @banterlytics @zachxbt @jc_1917 it's a UI dev, anyone is replaceable. think Zach could have mentioned in his first tweet it is just about JC, not treasure"
35,@drumm_12 @0xkafo @zachxbt @Treasure_DAO also true
36,@0xkafo @zachxbt @Treasure_DAO yes and if you have a large following you have to be aware of the impact of your tweets. It is simple. And yes a lot of people are short-term and not smart enough to participate in this industry
37,@drumm_12 @0xkafo @zachxbt @Treasure_DAO that also
38,"@0xkafo @zachxbt @Treasure_DAO Well you can think for longer than 3 seconds what the implication of a tweet like that is right? If you have something on someone that is fine, and good, but communicate it clearly if it is only about that one person, not the project he currently works for"
39,"@0xkafo @zachxbt @Treasure_DAO because he has a large following and now a legit project is tanking big. One dev that has (apparently) done something bad, does not mean a whole project is a scam. If he is a bad actor he will be replaced. Zach knows, just tweet the right info."
40,"@zachxbt if it is just him, and not connected to @treasure_dao as a whole, it would suit you to mention that in your first tweet"
41,@zachxbt @jc_1917 oh wtf
