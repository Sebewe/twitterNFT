41,"@humblealphashil @lex_node @BrantlyMillegan I mean the chatter beforehand was almost universally pro-firing the dude so 🤷‍♂️ Any ""sentiment check"" would just be for show. The real community are the DAO delegators and ENS holders. And they can buy, sell and delegate for w/e reason they want."
42,"@humblealphashil @lex_node @BrantlyMillegan There was a steward vote and his comments likely voided his employment contract with TNL. If i'm Nick, i'd rather rip the band aid off over a weekend vs. prolong the circus."
43,"@humblealphashil @lex_node @BrantlyMillegan I see your point but it can be both. There's a reason alisha.eth was hired. Please make your own judgement call - go watch recorded Brantly interviews. For me, that is not someone who appeals to the majority of mainstream users yet to enter the space"
44,@humblealphashil @lex_node @BrantlyMillegan Agree he was great at recruiting nerds like us - stellar really. But his marketing chops didn’t extend beyond that as recent evidence suggests. It was a PR test that he failed. Lots of marketing success came from empowered .eth users - can’t forget
45,"@lex_node @BrantlyMillegan The fact that he runs marketing for ENS and totally fumbled a PR response. I wish you could have listened to the spaces. If the guy responsible for recruiting new users utterly botches a PR challenge, maybe he’s not fit for that role."

48,"@nic__carter @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Dude if your spokesman who is responsible for marketing and recruiting new users fumbled the PR response as bad as Brantly did, you’d fire them too."
49,"@clubsodaaaaaa @iamDCinvestor To my knowledge, no. He did ops and marketing. I doubt nick and co would have cared if he was a dev who had a spicy tweet and was not the one responsible for going on podcasts and recruiting new users."
50,"@iamDCinvestor His role was marketing and he fumbled a PR response. He did a great job of appealing to nerds like us but as adoption grows, ENS needs someone who does PR better. Luckily they have this in Alisha.eth."
