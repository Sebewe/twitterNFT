1,@OttoSuwenNFT First phase of NFTs is practically over. Builders better start building some legit projects now.
2,Seems like every project I touch lately just loses me money. Guess it’s all over now.
3,@beaniemaxi Scaling is the hardest thing to do. It took Shopify years to get it right with an incredible and large team. This tweet shows you don't understand the technical side of things..

13,@HOWLERZNFT @NonFungibleNoah so you load your website with the “scam contract” and briefly let it go live and then switch it up with a newly deployed contract that looks exactly the same? The hell is this?

19,@OttoSuwenNFT @KeyboardMonkey3 Wonder how many of them were around for 2017-2019.
20,"@KeyboardMonkey3 triggering people right now, but the shelf life of your ""WGMI""  sentiments would definitely extend further if you listened a bit and paid off all your ""web2 me"" debt instead of being overleveraged in a single sector in the vast expanse that is crypto. Idk tho. https://t.co/QswtF2F3ud"

33,"Evolving anime NFT that earns “experience” the more you hold it. Stake it (train) with multiple from the same collection to get experience faster.

First 50% to hit x exp get their shikai and increase in rarity.

42,"Love how many people are getting into NFTs, but I miss the early days when there were very few rugs, Art Blocks Curated was always profitable and no one knew how to trait sniff.. definitely didn’t accumulate enough."

55,@shoopywoopyy I say less than 2 months because you're a beast.

57,"Are people dumping $MAGIC to chase the ETH pump only to realize they’re already too late and when $MAGIC pumps, they’ll chase it and realize they’re late again? https://t.co/tReDhjVbBL"
58,Looking for a @raidparty guild. Prefer serious players with Genesis Heroes. 👀 #raidparty #P2E #CryptoGaming
59,"@TheShamdoo @OttoSuwenNFT Definitely leaked early, had it 2 minutes before they even posted it. Even then, buttons were fucked. https://t.co/Jr4Ptqs6vu"
60,"- Link leaked early, wonder why
- After signing you had to hit ""Reserve"" again to buy it?
- Refreshing page kills the app
- Can't speed up your tx

What an annoying drop. Parallels did it way better."
61,Remember when @AzukiZen had a smooth drop with low gas fees? Haven't seen a project launch as well as them since..

74,@tropoFarmer @opensea @scythecollects @opensea Hire me and I'll verify all the proper accounts.

76,@KosherPlug NFT winter was a real thing.
77,"Cool Pets.

That's the tweet."
78,Picking back up on @LegendsOfVenari and @crypto_raiders while getting ready for @raidparty and @coolcatsnft pets. Crypto gaming + NFTs keep you pretty busy..
79,"@OttoSuwenNFT @icebergy_ Yep, which is why I usually don't bother with them anymore. Just play with bluechips or buy on secondary if I think it has legs."
80,"@icebergy_ To add on to this, they can be grinding multiple projects at once during an 8 hour work day. So if there are a few solid projects in a given week or two timespan, you're most likely coming out a winner."
81,"@OttoSuwenNFT @icebergy_ From what I've noticed, great projects will allocate less than 10-15% to whitelists and have a public sale for the rest. When you over allocate, the floor just gets annihilated and people lose interest in the entire project quickly."
82,"@icebergy_ If it's a big project, of course. Hiring 20 people for $8/hr for a week is ~9k. They each can handle 25-50 accounts each so assuming 36 accounts per person, thats 720 entries. You hit 5/720 on something like Asuna/Azuki and you've already made your money back. Absolutely crazy."
83,@OttoSuwenNFT @icebergy_ I hate the current WL meta. Auctions seem greedy sometimes but I think it's a lot easier to impose restrictions and add flexibility to them moreso than WLs.
84,"@icebergy_ When whitelisting first started, a few friends and I paid fiverr people to grind them out on multiple accounts. Did the same for things like Mekaverse raffles.

It's just being done on a larger scale now that makes it all not worthwhile. Bring back gas wars or use 721A"
85,@KeyboardMonkey3 @DeezeFi @ThatsTheGwei Been calling for a high-def anime project since August and Azuki definitely hit that niche. I think it'll retrace but think a complete dump isn't likely unfortunately.. this is coming from someone who had 60 and dumped them all at 2.8 though. https://t.co/QvAHldQsIz
86,"@ResellCalendar wow thank you ser, was in line when you tweeted and just ordered. https://t.co/ONzoEunREW"
87,"@Dior_eth @LooksRareNFT @TroveByTreasure The former had a private seed round to further deepen the pockets of whales and encourages wash trading while the latter is open source, has a bridge for L1 &amp; L2 NFTs and had developers who previously worked for the former until they left..

Think this choice is obvious."
