2,"@badymmot @crypto_corgis you chose an hard one to pump, good luck. there are several older collections btw, this was like late stage february pfp pump"

6,@cyberh49 Can i financial advice this ? Clearly dont mint anything for 8.88
7,@ddasattack I have been getting very slowly back in looks but market seems completely different from first pump.
8,"@NathanHeadPhoto ""reputable"" people is quite a blurry term nowadays."
9,@pewpewpewmoo 2 cool pets ser obviously
10,@7Surfer7Silver7 @fewocious my 50 cool pets getting tons of milk
11,"RT @0x99ed: I just bought an NFT for 28 ETH on OpenSea and now it's marked as ""suspicious activity"". The hacker already sold it to someone…"
12,@cr0ssETH I recommend buying now ser.
13,"@v0paNFT @YannickCrypto Yeah could be a dev they hired that organised this, never the CC core team tho imo."
14,@YannickCrypto Cool Cats team made 80 eth on trading fees past hour. 0 chance they did an inside job like this for 60 eth. Makes no sense.
15,"@0x99ed @opensea @opensea_support This is the most ridiculous shit ever, good luck ser."
16,"Accumulating more and more cool pets by @coolcatsnft, up to 32 now. Way too cheap for cute pets + evolving + playable + making $MILK everyday. https://t.co/aRsfY3MbQl"
17,"@songadaymann yes ser, you have all the time to claim and game should start in the next days when you will get to play with them"
18,@SmartContracter lol what about the one just before ser
19,@numba_go_up Always have a massive stablecoins bag ser 🤝
20,Would you rather bet on :
21,"YES love to see the cheap @artblocks_io curated mint at .1 , feels good https://t.co/rkxHTz4MHL"
22,@BoredApe1000 clones looks better
23,@AkiraReloaded @RTFKTstudios this is top tier damn im jelly
24,"@FraRusso33 @LooksRareNFT Not really, i am very bad in illiquid markets"
25,Reason number 17 of why @LooksRareNFT and $LOOKS are doing well and will keep doing so https://t.co/bHkfhZD4Ha
26,"Floor on @RTFKTstudios Clone X keeps going up non stop, you dont want to bet against a team wanting to pump them with utility and Nike's money and connections. (got 14 personally) https://t.co/KKAxGQKzx2"
27,@FraRusso33 Thank you ! It turned out super well indeed !
28,@yhCuwup I hope more ser
29,@TheScreamingMen thank you ser
30,@Tschuuuuly Thank you !
31,@philipplgh Huge congrats !
32,"Gm, today might be the last day in a while to buy punks below 200k $, 23 sales in the past hour aka 4 mil $. NFTs are only getting bigger and there will always only be 10000 punks, get your historic pfp while you can. Here mine https://t.co/RsDEjBS9An"
33,@CardilloSamuel I hope next time she gets a clone x as a gift too ! Déconne pas 😉
34,"@ohmyeth Saw your very nice buys, congrats!"
35,@kryptoseph @opensea @LooksRareNFT Good luck ser. weth in rewards does not earn anything so you can claim it and either buy some nice nfts or buy more $looks too ;)
36,"As expected, fundamentals &gt; short term ui issues. @opensea will never change fundamentals/have a token. It will stay a web2 company in a web3 world. @LooksRareNFT has very strong tokenomics, team and fundamentals and the ui WILL be improved. Bet on the web3 winner $LOOKS https://t.co/tA9nxLJyde"
37,Been steadily accumulating @RTFKTstudios Clone X  because undervalued. For example I just hit an amazing bid on this incredible combo : https://t.co/VrmdOb28fK
38,@cyounessi1 stLOOKS that uses all weth rewards to buy more looks sounds good
39,"Anyone is a genius in a bull, still all up from call :
50% @RTFKTstudios ; 300% @worldofwomennft ; 100% @RealSupDucks ; 150% @robotosNFT ; 180% @CryptoMories https://t.co/OdwLYBpm7p"
40,@halina_eth No
41,Thanks @feeswtf for reminding us how good @LooksRareNFT and $LOOKS are.
42,@fafaf0f0 @RTFKTstudios @opensea Boss
43,@fafaf0f0 @RTFKTstudios @opensea Yes https://t.co/1uQ9bABPBR
44,"Murakami bought @RTFKTstudios Clone X all in increasing price over the past 4h (alfalfa ?), he checked @opensea price low to high and just market bought whatever he likes whatever the price. Insane https://t.co/NdXpOGt3hx"
45,"@Loopifyyy I agree with pointing out problems, but imo the wash is a non-problem here. It shows that the platform can handle traffic, and as normal trades increase there will be less washing. What's the issue here?"
46,"@Loopifyyy They get rewards too, this is a stress test to show that the platform works and is legit. Dont hate the $LOOKS"
47,"@jmac101999 @opensea @LooksRareNFT Yeah, also if you stake you get slow rewards in eth which is a way of taking profits. (or you can claim those and buy more too)"
48,@nft_anthony @opensea @LooksRareNFT https://t.co/yDGOo5FxSQ
49,"@tea_eye1 It shows that the platform works, is safe and can handle traffic."
50,@nft_anthony @opensea @LooksRareNFT Yes. People that worry about quickly fixable UI details while the mindset and incentive design is amazing are ngmi
51,"An other morning, an other reason to be bullish $LOOKS and stake it : 380% APR paid in $ETH coming from trading fees.

You can invest in the main @opensea competitor and start earning from their success NOW. @LooksRareNFT https://t.co/BzaZChyJNP"
52,"@LooksRareNFT @DCLBlogger Don't forget a this priority ser, as a big $LOOKS holder and fan. https://t.co/rfgnq22iie"
53,"@chrisdevlin7700 @LooksRareNFT No, rewards start now and there were no weth rewards before."
54,"@chrisdevlin7700 @LooksRareNFT In 40 min the rewards start, so you will be able to see the rewards accrue and click the button. Right now button is not clickable cause you would pay gas for nothing as rewards have not started yet"
55,"@chrisdevlin7700 @LooksRareNFT you jut need to wait, it starts in 40 min at 02:00 UTC"
56,@screentimes @AlgodTrading yes
57,@piperlikejpeg @sum1eth @LooksRareNFT looks like you need more $LOOKS
58,@NathanHeadPhoto https://t.co/XCLZuvnEaU
59,Theory : @geniexyz is to @LooksRareNFT what @ConvexFinance is to @CurveFinance. https://t.co/H43nKcgQKW
60,@JPEG_Simp @LooksRareNFT My investment is airdrop (free) + I bought 18 eth
61,@EdgarAronov @LooksRareNFT I am deep airdrop plus 18 eth so far
62,"$LOOKS doing amazing, I am up to 170 K $ and with $ETH rewards coming to stakers today is gonna be a good day @LooksRareNFT"
63,"Minted a few lovely Chimera by @mpkoz, and now i just realised that it has the best distrib ever https://t.co/wGRzFsPAGL"
64,@JPEG_Simp im thinking at least 4 usd
65,"@JPEG_Simp hold and stake when gas gets cheaper, right now price is low imo"
66,"$ETH is dumping but $LOOKS is saving us all, sold none and been accumulating up to 55k $LOOKS or 120k $."
67,"@NathanHeadPhoto UI can improve but 2 big choices that i like : 
- mass bid on collection
- private trading without fees (like old OS)"
68,@_Wyb0 @LooksRareNFT https://t.co/i5B7oKlnPV
69,@Loopifyyy @LooksRareNFT Total of 30k over a dozen wallets
70,"70k $ @LooksRareNFT airdrop #Looks, monday starting the right way. Staking it all btw"
71,"@flurnft I swept sherbets an hour ago, this is a serious team with a plan and have been out for a while https://t.co/ZWImLgzk8z"
72,"@TrippCouch4 I think that maybe ""iconic"" AB can be a long term investment. Also i dont think its a failure if i sell, i still bought my ED at 9 and people minted below 1 etc... I just think that with current dynamics i dont see the bull case for the average AB collection."
73,"@l0loXol0l I was talking about the ""AB stamp"" on the art and not the individual artists, see this https://t.co/MHRkplijDV"
74,"@randomcdog I really hope you are right, i still have big ab bags"
75,"@thomas_g_obrien You are right, my sentiment of the market is based more on this analysis i made a twp months ago than these two sales : https://t.co/MHRkplijDV"
76,"Sold my Elevated Deconstruction (lowest supply curated AB) for 60 eth ten days ago, an other one sold for 23 eth yesterday. Thinking med/long term for nfts is necessary, and AB constant inflation makes most of AB an obvious sell these days."
77,"@zerobeta No. ""the bots"" is a scapegoat, all bots are owned by people AND nowadays mints have like 50% ownerships after DA, the vast majority of minters are not bot."
78,"@zerobeta The problem for pa is constant inflation with DA, simple as that. Imagine Cool Cats selling 100 cats on a DA every week...price would tank v hard v fast"
79,"The ""fat punk thesis"" switched in the past months, it is now at play with the new blue chips: apes ecosystem, cool cats, clone x and doodles."
80,@punk2513 cool cats
81,@KNFT45 @raise_exception @doodles @RTFKTstudios @worldofwomennft @RealSupDucks @robotosNFT @CryptoMories @forgottenrunes I picked up a dozen
82,"@raise_exception @doodles @RTFKTstudios @worldofwomennft @RealSupDucks @robotosNFT @CryptoMories @forgottenrunes I love wizards, they pumped well in the past week already tho, was looking more at stuff that didnt really pump"
83,"@doodles @RTFKTstudios @worldofwomennft @RealSupDucks @robotosNFT @CryptoMories So far mories and robotos went up a bit, supducks went up a lot and clone x and WOW stayed there...cheap pfps look like a good play."
84,@NathanHeadPhoto @GRAYCRAFTnft Now the trick is to find whats not pumping yet
85,"@pravijn @doodles @RTFKTstudios @worldofwomennft @RealSupDucks @robotosNFT @CryptoMories Clone X is a tricky one, imo needs any news/fuel to moon hard, right now its in a weird pause"
86,"@Maxorgel3701 @doodles @RTFKTstudios @worldofwomennft @RealSupDucks @robotosNFT @CryptoMories Yeah the comparison to deadfellas is what makes me really think this is a buy, i already bought like 5 or 6 but im thinking about buying more"
87,@Oussz @doodles @RTFKTstudios @worldofwomennft @RealSupDucks @robotosNFT @CryptoMories Ca part
88,@Hanrgb @doodles @RTFKTstudios @worldofwomennft @RealSupDucks @robotosNFT @CryptoMories what's floor
89,"Eyeing 5 collections that feel like a buy given recent @doodles and MAYC pump (1 or 2 week hold or less if pump a lot faster) :
Clone x @RTFKTstudios at 4 floor;
@worldofwomennft at 2 floor;
@RealSupDucks at 1.1 floor;
@robotosNFT at .6 floor;
@CryptoMories at .5 floor;
Opinions?"
90,@swartzcenter oh boy
91,"@Kinchasa5000 @0xGasDAO just refresh imo, websites are usually reread the data on chain and it updates"
92,@realDevDotEth @artblocks_io @fx_hash_ Imo the main point is low gas fees and low prices of the art. Artists getting on AB somehow are convinced they have to get millions per drop and avoid gas wars at all cost.
93,@iblamenfts quantbike.eth
94,@__proper Would have minted too if supply &lt;250
95,"Gm, tweeted this during the night yesterday, do share your thoughts https://t.co/ofXi1LFuz2"
96,@K3nnyth3Butch3r The dropping rate is up to AB which really positions more as a neutral platform. It is up to artists to chose pricing and methods tho
97,"AB secondary is ded... 0 expectations but : 
when market dies and collectors get in bad mood, gift stg for Christmas? Make your next/current playground free for holders/raffle some for them? It would all be good vibes. Raising 100s eth while collectors down 95% is not the play."
98,@BerzerkBitcoin @dmitricherniak Last sale is 23
99,@dmitricherniak Are you actually shilling a 1200 eth listing ? In this market? With ringers selling at 23 ?
