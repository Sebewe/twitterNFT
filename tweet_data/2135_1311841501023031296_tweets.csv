10,"NFT culture has become so cringe lately. Simping endlessly for WL, shitty derivatives that are so obviously low effort, 400k discord member on a month old project yet to release with anyone who mints getting rekt. 

Bad look, feel bad for new entrants that don’t know any better."

14,"@andy8052 Minted a decent amount and loved these because of the Fire Emblem/FF Tactics pixel style, but was still new to NFT’s and took profit when it became available. Hard for me to jump back in at these prices now despite how much I want to 😅"

78,"@CoachBrimmer @JacobKniffen @The_Uncontested @Tayler_P15 @KMehrabianCCM @OKCTracker Understandable, and it definitely wouldn’t get any easier in the NBA. Gonna need to put him on that Giannis workout plan. Thankfully his length is a huge plus to his frame. Either way, with anyone of these top 5 picks and Presti, we’re gonna end up with a great pick!"
79,"@JacobKniffen @CoachBrimmer @The_Uncontested @Tayler_P15 @KMehrabianCCM @OKCTracker He would also get an abundance of playing time with Horford/Brown gone, as opposed to the Thunder seemingly guard heavy roster. Would need to share minutes between Shai/Dort/Ty/Maledon"
80,"@JacobKniffen @CoachBrimmer @The_Uncontested @Tayler_P15 @KMehrabianCCM @OKCTracker Very bullish on Suggs. But Like you guys said in a previous pod (listen to each one btw, love them!), in a time when the big man seems to be coming back, especially skilled ones (Jokic/Embiid) I don’t think we can afford to pass up Mobley. 1/2"
81,"@CoachBrimmer @JacobKniffen @The_Uncontested @Tayler_P15 @KMehrabianCCM @OKCTracker If we we're to land pick number 2, who are you taking? My other choice would probably be Suggs"
