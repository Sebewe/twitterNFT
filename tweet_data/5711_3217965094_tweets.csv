19,@val3nft @DataNFT_ There needs to be a balance. Valid criticism =/= trashing. Problems need to be discussed publicly or we as a whole lose credibility. Support for #WomenInNFTs needs to be about more than cheerleading. Holding us to the same standards that all project must address is important.

22,"If you cannot build a genuine community, you can not support a project long-term. Community requires both trust and true engagement. Foster those and you will make it."
23,"2) Stop putting Hype before true Community. This is making it all a numbers game and not always an honest one. Sell out in seconds? That was a bot, not your community. 50k followers and no sell-out. That was a different bot."
24,1) Stop with the blind trust. This goes for collectors and teams. Don't just superficially DYOR. Dive as deep as you can before buying. Ask questions. Devs and founders need to ask artists questions about how they work. Artists need to set compensation expectations early.

42,Here in #nfts I have never felt any of that negativity. It is a nice change and I can’t wait to see what comes next.
43,Some like mini collectors were generally ok if not exactly warm and welcoming. In all of those spaces it always seemed as if I had to justify my presence either as a woman or age (too young or too old) or prove my loyalty to the hobby (doll loyalists can be extreme).
44,"I am admittedly somewhat of a serial collector. That has led me to be a part of many different communities over time. Some, like doll collectors, could be brutally awful (sorry to any doll collectors that are actually nice. There are some out there.)"
45,"Happy Valentine’s Day to the whole #NFTCommumity especially #WomenInNFT  . This is such a great and welcoming space. Yes there are some bad eggs, but there is also an overwhelming general positivity."
