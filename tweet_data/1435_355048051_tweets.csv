0,@drewcoffman @TheSmircs These are 🔥 giving me mfers f*ck off vibes for some reason
1,I know it only seems like a little thing but I'd rather be clear about it from the get go rather than have content created on content and accidentally cement this view! If any other creators are watching... 👀
2,"Yo @nftpasta @thebrettway thanks for the shoutout on your vid https://t.co/75ww3NiNj8 appreciate the love ❤️ just wanna correct that @whatthefurr and I are equal rather than one of us being the ""main"" founder! 🙂"
3,"@_Catalyzt_ @whatthefurr @ThePossessedNFT Only 2 of us my guy 🙂 the other 2 in the photo are our significant others, though they have done a lot to help and support us (and put up with us) to get this far!"
4,"RT @ThePossessedNFT: 🚨 30,000 🚨 The posse is growing fast! Welcome frens, we’re just getting started. GN ✌️ https://t.co/DhUKShbemI"
5,"@GgeraldOfficial @ThePossessedNFT @whatthefurr Thanks for the heads up, nothing to do with us. Reported."
6,When you're passionate and love what you do it's easy to get lost in work and spend every hour of the day pushing. You need to force yourself to stop and find that balance long term. Gaming is my release for this.
7,Sad to see such great art and creativity not get released. However huge respect to the creators for being able to reflect and take such a hard decision. Burnout is real and something I experienced a taste of at @Hubble https://t.co/liXBsC2CjD
8,@JojoRegan @ThePossessedNFT @whatthefurr Thanks dude! Last 48 hours has been nuts

54,"Catching up on some @matt_levine reading. Few people can make ""boring"" topics entertaining and informational. This bit about Theranos really summed up VC power dynamics for me:"
