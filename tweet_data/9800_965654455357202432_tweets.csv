10,@RayedLav @Boribo34 My favorite part about NFT’s is you can go and see that these transfers aren’t happening. No one won anything. This SCAMMER does not own these apes. BAYC529’s wallet isn’t transferring anything. He doesn’t own the NFT’s he claims to be giving away. SCAM!!!

17,"@skullyman13 @RayedLav He doesn’t. It’s a scam account to grow followers fast, then get paid to shill small NFT projects. Don’t follow this loser."
18,"@RayedLav Scam. Your OS and ETH aren’t an ENS name. You ONLY post about giveaways. Funny enough, the same wallet doesn’t even own the things you claim to be giving away. Loser"
19,"@RayedLav The second tweet just like this. No proof of giveaways, just spamming for followers and engagement. You’re a bot and a scam."
20,@RayedLav Where’s the proof?!? You’re just a scam bot.
21,@llorag_ojie @RayedLav Nobody wins this. It’s just to get followers and engagement. It’s a scam.
22,"@RayedLav @NFTLIFER The question becomes, how long until they block me for exposing the scam."
23,"@RayedLav @NFTLIFER This account has 12 tweets, all about giving away NFT’s and ETH. When are people gonna start to realize these are all scams. This guy is not giving away something worth a quarter of a million dollars."

42,This is what I can’t stand about Twitter. This account does NOTHING but fake giveaways and whitelist shills and they have 10k followers. This space needs to be better about recognizing bot accounts like this that only want scam for growth and not build an audience. https://t.co/GRPy27Ojnt

78,@glengadinvestor Anecdotal. It’s a marketing scheme to build engagement/sell your info. Very low odds and most have no obligation to give anything away. There’s ZERO obligation on Twitter. It’s just an engagement scam.
