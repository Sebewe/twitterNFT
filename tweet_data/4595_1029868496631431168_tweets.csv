3,@ogKOBEWAN @fudbuddies Wrong brand my guy
4,"Some people in the nft space really need to learn how to say the word ""please""."
5,@Whatitdobabyyy1 @coolcatsnft Gm!

7,"@BAYC2745 @Scotty_Kirby_ @psychedelic_nft It's unfortunately too far from me and II have work friday morning😢. If they did it in the CBD I 100% would've been there, but bondi is too far for me."
8,"Here for a long time, AND a good time @coolcatsnft WLTC! https://t.co/4vqwxtDdXt"
9,"If you're looking at getting a discord server audited, or you just want to touch up your security in the server, please, PLEASE reach out to @pandez_ . The knowledge he has in the line of work he does is remarkable. Could not recommend more highly."
10,@PUMA @coolcatsnft Yoooooooo LFG!!! WLTC!! https://t.co/FyOF1iIq6b
11,@nemesislike @coolcatsnft Appreciate it my friend!
12,"For the first time in a long time, I've decided to load up the old twitch! If you're an apex player or just wanna pass some time, come hang out and talk some smack, and shill me some projects!

13,"Changed my steam name to ""Bloot"" so when I screw my team mates over, at least they were warned. https://t.co/SSdFtVFt8D"
14,"Gm friends! I hope your mints reveal 1/1's (unless you sold pre-reveal, cause that would suk) ☕️"
15,@SlabberDan @coolcatsnft Thank you man. I’ve had to make a lot of flips to get here. First thing I’m working my way towards now is back into the gang so I can rep my merch again!
16,My entire timeline is Kevin and honestly? I’m not even mad about it.
17,"@concretenft @coolcatsnft Appreciate it man! 

I sadly had to flip a lot of nfts I loved to get this, but I will be buying back into every community I had to sell the second I have the eth!"
18,@jbondwagon @coolcatsnft Thank you! So happy to officially be apart of the community.
19,@not_katarina @coolcatsnft Thank you kat 🥺 very long awaited and couldn’t be happier.
20,"After 6 long months in the nft space, I can officially say I own a @coolcatsnft !!! This has been one of my goals since I joined the space and I’m so happy right now.  #NewNFTProfilePic NFT by CoolCatsContract https://t.co/5AB57Uo3rF"
21,"RT @NFTLlama: how many people think i farm engagement? i don’t believe it…

if we get 1000 likes and 500 comments i may actually believe it…"
22,"@NFTLlama How to engagement farm 101. 

Llama with the smart plays."
23,"@TypicalxKiefer Space doodles is your doodles thou, just in a ship, which you can take it out of/put it in. Doodles floor is 11.5eth, so they just lost 6.5eth"
24,"@Ramin_delgato Yeah man, somebody sold it for 5eth as well."
25,"Big F’s in the chat for those who sold their Space Doodles for 7eth and below, thinking it was an entirely new nft."
26,"@Zeneca_33 Beanie is a valuable asset to the nft community

Kingkyo.eth"
27,@0x_fxnction I deadass nearly bought a Kevin at .4 but didn’t and now regret it
28,"@Snake_Gee Yup, there was a guide created by @tropoFarmer on how to link it through ledger live."
29,Why anybody would choose to track sticks over nfts baffles me. At least with nfts you get some real world benefits and can actually build a community behind it.
30,@SeraStargirl @FomoMofoNFT They’re actually extremely nice!
31,Hexagons are the new check mark.
32,Why are y’all allowing beanie to come back? Just don’t interact with his stuff and hope he slithers away again
33,@ohhshiny It is serious project
34,@Scotty_Kirby_ @jtanton @psychedelic_nft @BAYC2745 Come on at least make it the CBD to be accessible to all 😂

40,"Thank you all for the positive feedback on the discord template I created this morning! I have been contemplating recording videos teaching people how to set up specific bots for their servers/how to use them. 

Would people be interested in this type of content?"
41,"Today has been a lesson to us all, that ANY server can be compromised, and that there are rotten people everywhere in this world. Always do your DD and stay safe everybody."
42,"This is a very basic template just to cover the basics so people can also tweak how they like! 

My first suggestions would be adding MEE6 to the server and turning on “Reaction Roles”, as well as turning the server into a community server. Happy to teach how to do both of these!"
43,"I’ve had a few people reach out to me in the last 24 hours about needing help designing discord servers, so I’ve made a brief nft server template free for anybody to use. Happy to teach you how to set up bots also if needed! 

Enjoy 😊 https://t.co/SRAYJlcFGN"
44,"@GusR511 @CryptoMories .@sabet hit them with a dmca. Pretty sad considering what he has trademarked he isn’t the original creator but he trademarked it, so he is able to hit them with the claim. 

Dude pretty much buried his career in the nft world as nobody respects him right now."
45,"@TebachETH @sabet @CryptoMories That’s not banned, that’s timed out."
46,@HypzorNFT Appreciate it! She’s definitely a beauty.
47,"@mikeygnft I’d 100% get rid of whitelists. Bring back stealth mints, or as much as they fumbled the ball, bring back what Mekaverse did and do the raffle. Whitelists are just toxic grinds that ruin projects before they start because people will pump a project so hard then dump on mint."
48,@ShrewdCharlie Wonder how much they paid him to make this lmao.
49,@WonderPals https://t.co/y1Em8uPu02
50,Stop looking for “the next BAYC” and find a project that’s building something nobody else is doing. Those are the projects that will survive long term.
51,This is another reason why the whitelist meta needs to end. Bring back stealth drops. https://t.co/X4JkWbP7SE
52,@PunkieEth Surely it’s gotta be @FangGangNFT
53,"Going to possibly take a break from nfts for a bit, nothing excites me right now. Going to just continue building discords/learning how to code. 

If any new projects need a discord created but aren’t sure where to start, feel free to dm me! Happy to help."
54,.@JoinTopgg has an opensea sales bot!? Bro this is a game changer. I spent WEEKS trying to learn how to custom code/build discord opensea bots and it this legitimately took me 3 minutes to set up https://t.co/zM4c3ZUpzg

66,"Yo, no way! I put my entire net worth into @Pixelmon and it revealed today, what rarity do you think this is?! https://t.co/nfBB7sbfJb"
67,"Nfts feel so stale right now for me. None of my nfts are selling for the prices I want, and I won’t grind discord for whitelists so I’m just sitting here kinda existing in the space."
68,@AussieMatesio Nice foot tan
69,@not_katarina Pls don’t hurt my feelings
70,For the culture https://t.co/QtLHG6AwM7

73,If y’all need me today I’ll be playing Pokèmon GO.
74,"@0xMonocle @0x_fxnction Weather report still hasn’t minted. They announced their mint price as like .15 or something and got flamed for it, and that’s the last I’ve heard from them tbh."
75,"@0xMonocle @0x_fxnction Dented feels is the original artist that was hired for weather report but they tried to heavily under pay him which he argued so they kicked him off the project and found somebody new. 

So he took his art he made, and made dented feels with it."
76,"@JB__nfts @BAYC2745 @psychedelic_nft No you all know how it feels!!! 

Being an Aussie in the space there’s nothing more frustrating than every single announcement being “PST” or “EST” 😂"
77,"Gm y’all. 

Say it back in your native language!"

81,"I really dislike ""delist"" culture. Who are we to tell others what to do with their assets/money, just because you want the floor to go up, increasing your assets worth? Rather telling people to delist, give them a reason as to why they SHOULD delist."
82,"Happy Friday, from Sylvanas and I. https://t.co/7660cmqFs4"
83,@TheShamdoo It’s extremely difficult in this space to bite your tongue to maintain professionalism whilst also calling others out on their bullshit. I respect those who can do it successfully

91,"So, we all agreeing now to avoid any project these Fortnite influencers are apart of? 💀"
92,"@WonderPals Ser I believe you messed up with the spread sheet. I don’t see my wallet on there. It’s okay, we can rectify these issues quite easily!"
93,"@MetaJoey @coolcatsnft Nice pickup homie but also, I’m now crying"
94,"As a current serving member in the navy, this whole situation is terrifying, knowing the chances of me being sent is slim, but still possible, is something I wished I'd never have to experience in my life time. Hug your families tight, and pray for Ukraine and it's people."
95,@OsgoodKane @turietho @CoachNft01 @NooMp13 Read the post my man.
96,@Stoniphantom Yikes
97,@alieano_ @CryptoMories No buying/slow buying makes people sell quick because they believe it’s going to keep going lower and they need to exit asap. Sadly it all started trending after the steve Aoki pump. Encouraged a lot of flippers to buy the hype and sell immediately
