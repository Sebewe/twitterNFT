78,"47/47

Let's end with a quote by @NiftyWhaleNFT himself. If you replace “OpenSea” with @SpacePoggersNFT, Nifty nicely summarizes why it is within the interest of the entire #NFTCommunity to work to prevent this sort of behavior: https://t.co/Etg67tYy5m"
79,"46/47

.@SpacePoggersNFT owes it to the NFT space to do something about @NiftyWhaleNFT’s behavior. While most rugs are anonymous, Nifty’s biz-license provides an IRL connection and the possibility of legal enforcement. That alone is rare and shouldn’t be taken for granted."
80,"45/47

With all of this mind, what should the @SpacePoggersNFT community, and the broader #NFT community, do about @NiftyWhaleNFT? Here we have a founder that overpromised and underdelivered to investors, leaving collectors with the 1121 ETH bag while the founders enjoy 670+ ETH."
81,"44/47

3) Shortly before appearing on @garyvee and @mattkalish's podcast, @NiftyWhaleNFT changed Poggers' OpenSea royalties wallet. The post-podcast pump yielded ~$100k that was cashed out on Coinbase, with some funds sent to an ENS address that included Nifty’s likely real name. https://t.co/856vIwCcbZ"
82,"43/47

2) Despite claims that he took no pay, @NiftyWhaleNFT likely received at least $1M from @SpacePoggersNFT. This claim is corroborated by 2 BAYC purchases made by a dev wallet on the same day he verified in the BAYC Discord and that he tweeted himself playing the MAYC game. https://t.co/8EIwQfyYto"
83,"42/47

1) Over 1/2 of the 1121 ETH from mint was paid out to developers within a month. Despite promises to spend hundreds of thousands on the project’s animated series, only $50k (less than 1% of project revenue) was actually used for animation (30-sec teaser &amp; 90-sec pilot). https://t.co/GNLHYxQnzR"
84,"41/47

Regardless of what actions are taken by @NiftyWhaleNFT and the former team, it's important that @SpacePoggersNFT's story be heard by the broader NFT community and that is why we released this Tweet despite Nifty's promise of ""additional financial resources.""

 Let's recap:"
85,"40/47

Shortly after @NiftyWhaleNFT's statement, the BAYC Wallet sold its 2 BAYCs, along with 2 MAYC serums, for a total of 251 ETH. However, no reimbursement to the project has yet to be made: https://t.co/KvQTpBeihw"
86,"39/47

As the New Year began, the @SpacePoggersNFT began working on this Tweet thread to let the wider NFT Community know about @NiftyWhaleNFT's behavior. Right before the community planned to tweet, Nifty reappeared promising ""additional financial resources"" to the project. https://t.co/8drFVu2W4X"
87,"38/47

As for @NiftyWhaleNFT (the person), he deleted his Twitter and YouTube channel shortly after the claims were made. After a few days, he returned to Twitter but only after making sure that he blocked me first. https://t.co/egcj54yrZp"
88,"37/47

So what’s next for @NiftyWhaleNFT? In November, the address listed on NiftyWhale Inc’s biz license sold for $1.7M (https://t.co/IYHCdSnJXM). In December, instead of updating the address on their California business license, NiftyWhale Inc. surrendered their license in CA. https://t.co/WXiE9PkxiR"
89,"36/47

Despite his pushback, the claims made by the @spacePoggersNFT community seemed to struck a nerve with @NiftyWhaleNFT (or someone else on the former team). Shortly after, the BAYC wallet relinquished 35 ETH (of 370 ETH) back to the SP community: https://t.co/XsXO02JobF"
90,"35/47

... while @NiftyWhaleNFT responded to the ""goals"" question by alleging that he was receiving DMs containing ""frankly illegal threats."" No evidence was provided by Nifty as to the existence of these threats. This was his final message in the @SpacePoggersNFT discord. https://t.co/TP8fPvsES6"
91,"34/47

Finally, each party was asked to state their end goals. I asked that @NiftyWhaleNFT and the ""devs"" return 75% of the mint refunds (~400 ETH) since they caused the bug that necessitated refunds and drained the @SpacePoggersNFT treasury for future progress... https://t.co/3KYdO227yx"
92,"33/47

Third, when asked who owned “d*******m.eth,” the wallet that was funneled royalties following the @garyvee podcast, @NiftyWhaleNFT said that this was just a developer wallet. In other words, Nifty SAID that the CEO of NiftyWhale, Inc was just a random dev and not himself. https://t.co/1QHKLrEA5t"
93,"32/47

Second, when asked if he owned the BAYC wallet, @NiftyWhaleNFT insisted that a former @SpacePoggersNFT dev owned it and he merely gave them advice. Remember: Nifty tweeted about playing the MAYC game and verified in the BAYC Discord on the same day of the BAYC purchases. https://t.co/qvJZVCqruw"
94,"31/47

First, @NiftyWhaleNFT admitted to lying about ownership of the BAYC wallet back in Sept. He initially said the wallet was cold storage for the project, and he now claimed that it was a developer wallet. Again, that wallet was paid 370 ETH from the @SpacePoggersNFT mint. https://t.co/57gAMsBivn"
95,"30/47

Shortly after these claims were made by the @spacePoggersNFT community, @NiftyWhaleNFT responded. Since he was doxed by his business license, he didn’t have the luxury of remaining silent and hiding in the shadows. Here’s the highlights… https://t.co/TVOSqc2Xgq"
96,"29/47

Claim 7: The ""health issues"" that allegedly compelled @NiftyWhaleNFT to step down from @SpacePoggersNFT must be considered in light of his misleading statements elsewhere. ""Health issues"" are a common excuse by project founders for leaving a project (e.g. @BlankFaceNFT)."
97,"28/47

.@NiftyWhaleNFT made these forward-looking statements to @garyvee despite the fact that he had only spent 1% of mint on the animation and was secretly cashing out future project royalties onto Coinbase. Investors relied on this info, the project pumped, and then dumped. https://t.co/yDNvjmmwum"
98,"27/47

On the podcast, @NiftyWhaleNFT told @garyvee that the “core of [@SpacePoggersNFT]...  is building a really fun entertaining animated series” and that “he remained all-in on getting this animated series out on Netflix.” https://t.co/K7tDBE12Rd"
99,"26/47

Claim 6: Before going on @garyvee's podcast to discuss @SpacePoggersNFT, @NiftyWhaleNFT changed the OpenSea royalty wallet to a wallet unknown by the community. The podcast drove huge volume that yielded 26 ETH that went straight to Coinbase: https://t.co/ZKAsKBpaXt"
