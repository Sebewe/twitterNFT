68,"@itstylersays #YellowArmy, Admiral approved https://t.co/6LppxGRJRJ"
69,"So, when I think about how @0xApes_NFT could surpass a Blue Chip PFP project - it comes down to community.  It comes down to unity.  It comes down to belief.  It comes down to hope. And all of these things are in strong supply at @0xApes_NFT and ALL are welcome!  LFG 2022!!!!!"
70,"And we are our own community!  We are standing on the shoulders of giants like Punks and BAYC, but we're very much a movement that feels like the early days of BAYC.  We are #YellowArmy, and we'll have hodlers like @BraxtonMiller5 and we'll have more.  We are all apes."
71,"We're under no allusion that @0xApes_NFT are better or in any way superior to the OG @BoredApeYC, however, we take pride in mixing, matching, and maybe improving on a few things as outlined in this medium article https://t.co/Lpkzkf71yx"
72,"Cue @0xApes_NFT, a legitimate project stood up to honor the @BoredApeYC community and ideals, but be accessible to a new generation of hopeful NFT enthusiasts.  As they say, it's ""the same blood line, different tribe"".  Holders are known as #YellowArmy and are very passionate."
73,"So, @BoredApeYC have truly become and almost unattainable ""yacht club"" for the rich and famous and the elites.  And the prices keep climbing.  Which is fine and good for BAYC holders - however, it leaves the ""blue collar"" NFT hodlers to much riskier projects. Many are losing."
74,"That phenomenon attracted elite members like @jimmyfallon, @StephenCurry30, @KevinHart4real, @neymarjr and many others.  And the entry price (cost to own an ape) has risen from ~$350 back in May '21 to nearly $242K as of this writing. They have become a ""flex"" in crypto/social."
75,Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) become a club of crypto native “Apes” and “Degens” that drove the community to ubiquity.  It allowed average joes to sell their $500 investments for hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars.  It became a phenomenon.
76,"Punks were out of reach for many in May 2021 (13eth or around $50K) and were reserved for many who came into the space prior to the ’21 NFT boom.  These are people like @pranksy, @j1mmyeth, @Banks and others.  But soon become a ""flex"" for celebs like @SnoopDogg @obj and Jay-Z"
77,"First, we have to understand that BAYC was the first NFT to truly galvanize the ""commoner"" NFT players that came into the space in early 2021.  Prior to BAYC, CryptoPunks (launched by @larvalabs) was the OG PFP project launched in 2017."
78,"The closest PFP ""Blue Chip"" NFT would probably be WOW at 8.5eth as of this writing.  That's about 7.9eth away from the current @0xApes_NFT floor.  

So how could we see a 'derivative' project like @0xApes_NFT pass a blue chip like @worldofwomennft?"
79,"@0xApes_NFT @BoredApeYC 

A dissertation on why 0xApes will be the first derivative project to pass a Blue Chip PFP.

First, we need consensus on blue chip PFP projects. My list:

BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club)
CryptoPunks
Doodles
Cool Cats
World of Women
Cyberkongz
Veefriends"
