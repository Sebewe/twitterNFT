41,@DawsonBotsford @spencecoin @futurealisha It has indirect influence such as approving/rejecting budget request
42,I also posted the full threads on our @ensdomains governance forum https://t.co/qRxGbZ2otx
43,"To recap, Brantly still hold two positions, (b), the director at the ENS foundation and (c) being a delegate. We are expecting the DAO level voting to happen for (b), The only way to decrease voting power at (c) is up to the people who delegated their voting power to him."
44,"where we establish four working groups and nominate five stewards for each working group. For the first term, the three stewards were nominated via community voting, while the remaining two were nominated from TNL, which Brantly was a steward of the community working group."
45,"(d) As mentioned in (c), any asset transfer out of ENS DAO treasury requires a lengthy voting process. To streamline the management of the DAO for much smaller spending decisions, alisha.eth proposed the idea of ""Steward"" at https://t.co/Yn3quSdlEH"
46,"Nick and Brantly nominated themselves from TNL as delegates, and Brantly holds the most voting power among representatives https://t.co/xbYxIUYDuP . Please refer to our initial delegate announcement post for more detail https://t.co/yKIFWPtdEm about the nomination process"
47,"Soft/social consensus such as the establishment of working groups (to be explained) only need offchain voting, whereas any treasury asset transfer or registration/renewal parameter change and protocol upgrade require onchain vote."
48,"U need to have min 100,000 voting power for making a proposal (Brantly currently holds over 300k ). The proposal has to follow a forum post for temp check,  five days offchain voting via snapshot, seven days of onchain voting if the proposal requires any on-chain transactions."
49,"(c) ""Delegate"" is someone who holds voting power to ENS protocols, such as how the treasury should be allocated or changes to the registration/renewal process. You are a delegate no matter how many/few voting rights you hold."
50,"Please read https://t.co/S4vSZdi0fU for more detail.  Currently, there is a proposal to terminate his directorship at the ENS foundation at https://t.co/GhJk0GhoTl We currently recommend that he remains in that position until a replacement is nominated and voted in by the DAO"
51,"(b) The ENS foundation is the legal entity in the Cayman Islands established to provide limited liability to DAO participants for the actions of the DAO. Being in the directorship position doesn't have many days to day duties, but there are some risks and responsibilities"
52,"(a) TNL is a company based in Singapore and in charge of the development of the ENS protocol. Nick is the director of the company and announced the removal of Brantly. Even though the final decision was made by Nick, it was the result of the team discussion."
53,"Prior to these, here are the 4 roles he had.

- (a). The Director of Operation at True Names Limited (aka TNL), the company that develops the ENS protocol
- (b). A director @ ENS foundation
- (c). delegate with the highest voting power
- (d). ENS community working group steward"
54,"Currently, there were 2 actions made.

1. Nick announced the termination of Brantly at TNL https://t.co/kMwMhR1iOD
2. @ensdomains  community stewards decided to remove Brantly from the steward position https://t.co/oNNRVjqr2B"
