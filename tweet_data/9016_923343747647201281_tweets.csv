13,@tp_x2y2 Many reasons I guess but I would like to say because it's 1) Weird. 2). Alphanumeric (stick to characters) 3). Meaningless at first glance 4). Seems cheap and not trustworthy. So far I trust you and have coins but I highly suggest you buy a good .com or .io domain and rebrand.

71,I think this is good. $sos should have also implemented something similar. Giving a lot of power to the highest spenders can have a negative impact on larger communities and that's how DAO's ends up being a big player's private club. #NFT #NFTCommunity https://t.co/HFYGN1ofjM
72,@OttoSuwenNFT Man I am still holding a frog NFT that I bought from you. Lesson learned. Never buy a bag from NFT influencers. They will never likely sell because devs and influencers made their money off the followers. Wasted  0.25 eth which was all of my wallet balance. #NFT
