39,@ScottyMac101 @PJETCH @mrmakerbot You submitting weth offers?
40,"@PJETCH @mrmakerbot I'd heard the only reason for the very high price-point was because of the NFTs you needed to purchase to get access to the whitelist.

While I think IF is a cool concept with great animations, does it warrant a 6eth floor price for a brand new project? In my opinion, no"

91,6/7 The absolutely hilarious Twitter spaces this morning with Cloot @CloutedMind Wanky @0xwinky Mooshy @itmemushy Lobsy @Lobes604 and the baked cousin greg @doctoryuca had me cracking up to the point of literal tears. I never imagined making this many friends ...
92,"5/7 The fact that somebody I only met a few months ago would be so friendly, generous, and caring, is something that moves me nearly to tears. The whole ngmi vibe I felt this morning has completely dissipated, and I've been reinvigorated with the wgmi spirit (was that cringey?)"
93,"4/7 While at a pretty low point I reached out to my friend @0xwinky and let him know my plan about taking time off. Not only does he give me a pep talk, but offers, no, insists on helping out with the additional cost to help me get this beautiful @CoolmanUniverse (hi speshies!) https://t.co/58OtTwhUpp"
94,"3/7 I'm so thrilled to see my friends making it, I know how life-changing it can be and it couldn't be happening to better groups of people. But when you're an outsider looking in, it kind of stings, you know?"
95,"2/7 After waking up and coming to terms with losing out on god knows how many whitelists over the last few weeks, I was at my wits' end and ready to take a hiatus for a few days/weeks to clear my head. The grind has been tough, I'm not gonna lie."

1/7 In this post I'd like to try to find the words to express my gratitude to a good friend of mine @0xwinky. I've tried to write this a few times, but each time I've found myself still unable to articulate exactly what his gestures mean to me."
97,"After having sold my first to take some profit, I couldn't be more excited to rejoin the @CoolmanUniverse gang!
