Today I start a new Job with a new studio in some exciting new productions. 
Working for NFTs is great and exciting, but I still love the feeling of starting with a new team, in a new VFX Film or TV show.
Wish me luck!"

71,"RT @cobie: You can't make this up...

Pixelmon's art team are actually ....... people hired on Upwork https://t.co/QlLRqBM900"
72,Please support real artist-lead projects... https://t.co/WN40AfqsSL
73,@skewz1 @hatearies Go for it! :)
74,@JasVFX It was done in Miro
75,@skewz1 And then you have Weta in new Zealand as one of the main ones as well.
76,@skewz1 Well actually main VFX for main Hollywood films is made in Vancouver and London..
77,@hatearies @skewz1 Once again. Pointing at the diagram I made of vfx team structures that I commented above.
78,@skewz1 Perfect. Vancouver Film school is one of the best. In Montreal and Vancouver you have a lot of good studios. Most big vfx companies have studios either in Vancouver or Montreal :)
79,"@skewz1 If you want to go to proper VFX for Film you can either focus on 2D (composting, roto prep and paint) or any of the 3D departments. It's almost impossible to start without being a generalist first but you should keep in mind and focus on what you want to be in the future"
80,@skewz1 Where are you based?
81,"@skewz1 I'd also check my thread on vfx team structures in big vfx companies and see where you'd fit in:
https://t.co/D7TBWvoKc0

You can also consider taking a VFX course and excel at it to get an internship or something like Green Light at Dneg to get jumpstarted into film vfx"
82,"@skewz1 It's been a while but I started by doing a lot of personal projects, dedicating myself mostly to the department I'd want to work in (lighting and lookdev) and applying for smaller companies. I started as a junior generalist at Pixomondo and worked my way up to bigger companies"
83,@ZavvyEdits I wouldn't know there then. Most of the big vfx for Film is in Vancouver and London.

That's me in there https://t.co/BufVybOXq1"
96,@NegativeVibrat1 Gm ☕
97,@ZavvyEdits Then with that reel you can start applying for smaller companies and build up from that. Or you can take a VFX course that allows you to get an internship or something like the Green Light project at Dneg. Most companies for film are in London and Vancouver. Where are you based?
98,"@ZavvyEdits https://t.co/l5xVRJylWx

Check my thread about vfx team structure. Think where you'd like to fit in. What do you like to do the most. Try to build a portfolio reel that focus on that department. Most people have to start as generalists in smaller companies and slowly specialise"
99,@NoCreative_eth Good morning ☕
