60,Full post here: https://t.co/9GvcQ0W4eG
61,"5. DON’T WAIT UNTIL APRIL, THESE AREN’T NORMAL TAXES. If you have been messing around with lots of chains/protocols, Cointracker is not gonna do it all for you. It took me 2 months to get my shit in a good place for 2021."
62,"4. Don’t trade crypto for crypto if you can avoid it. Always sell for fiat or a stablecoin, and then buy whatever you want. The fees you pay will be worth the headache you save yourself."
63,3. Calculate the taxes for your wallets separately because doing it altogether can be overwhelming. Tip 1 and Tip 2 allow you to do this.
64,"2a. If your transactions have gotten hairy and get hard to figure out, at least you can liquidate the assets in that wallet, look at your contributions, and say hey I contributed 10k into this wallet and ended up with 2k, that’s an 8k loss. Then you can start fresh."
65,"2. Separate your wallets. Use at least one different wallet per network. Maybe even one per protocol. This way, you don’t have a cluster fuck of transactions across 5 networks that you have to sort through."
66,"1a. It’s easy with cash, but when you’re transferring crypto from a CEX to a wallet, you need to write down what the cost basis of that crypto was. Yes, you will be able to see these transactions in etherscan, BUT etherscan will not be able to tell you what the cost basis was."
67,"1. The ABSOLUTE MOST IMPORTANT thing for you to do is track your contributions. If you are adding cash or crypto into a wallet, make sure you write it down in a spreadsheet."
68,I actually did my DeFi taxes and it really sucked. Here’s what I learned: (5 tips in 🧵)
