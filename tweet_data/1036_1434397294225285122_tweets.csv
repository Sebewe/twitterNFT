1,@ape6743 @EthSauna @worldofwomennft @ChristiesInc Well deserved. Congratulations. Should be very proud of your achievements thus far. Good luck this evening!
2,"Established companies that have been with us forever don’t necessarily have to release their own projects…they will instead just align themselves with the best projects…💭

4,The power and reach of social media still excites me to this day. This post has a potential reach of 16.7 million people that we know of. The Brand awareness of @worldofwomennft is growing way faster than we think… Crazy to think that this Brand is still in its first year… 💭 https://t.co/TRwUj6NIg7
5,"Soon enough, showcasing our collections will be more than just a click of an OpenSea link. @some_place is a soon to be released mobile metaverse that will change the way we express ourselves in this space. Impressive!! Thanks for the opportunity to test @LanaHopkins3 @jdisimone_ https://t.co/3nyAd6pdvk"
6,Some of my @worldofwomennft representing in the living room as we get ready for @ChristiesInc https://t.co/J9yzLFn4KR

9,@krainak @veeconference 👏🏼👏🏼
10,One of the few times we seen someone with high influence properly adding value and experience to their NFT release. Nice work @TimmyTrumpet… This is a sign of what’s to come from this space. 👏🏼👏🏼 https://t.co/eoqNRBhKIt
11,No better way to build a strong community than by supporting one of your own that have supported you. The @worldofwomennft collabs give artists all around the world an amazing opportunity to be part of an incredible Brand that is WoW. Congrats @Benblenner 👏🏼 🇦🇺 🙂 https://t.co/NzWSQcw7pu
12,@badusernameplz @MyCurioCards No doubt my Fave! 👏🏼
13,"It’s still one of the best low risk , high reward plays you can make in this space. @MyCurioCards are the first ever art-related NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain. At current prices they are a great long-term hold. If you think your too late to this space, think again. 💭 https://t.co/nvf0MMe3nI"
14,Australia quickly catching up to rest of world…Nice work @NFT_MEL 🚀 https://t.co/Jc3aGuXHTN
15,"I’m so impressed by @BAYC2745 insight into this space. Completely understands the landscape. I have no doubt he has ability to transition @psychedelic_nft from a leading ‘Project’ to a leading ‘Brand’ within the space. Thanks @TomBilyeu for hosting. 

 https://t.co/6KiCUbEyZL"
16,@NFT_MEL Congratulations. Pity can’t be in attendance. I’m sure some incredible connections will be made! So good to see Australia quickly catching up to the rest of the world in this space. 🙂
17,Nice to see @PixelMapNFT starting to take shape. Did you know it’s the first NFT to store image data directly on the Ethereum blockchain? One of the most undervalued historical projects in the space led by highly passionate &amp; talented developer @KenErwin88. More to come here… 💭 https://t.co/klgn9gXlEm
18,"@ericmcdonald99 One of the following I’d do. 

1. Obtain a @worldofwomennft or @clonexbot 

2. Fill up on @10KTFshop Genesis Items 

3. As many Apple @MyCurioCards as I could      get"
19,Great to see some Australian talent making an impact on this Space. Congrats @some_place  👏🏼 https://t.co/AXrpcGUxBN
20,"Most likely ‘Brands’ to come out of this space…

23,@EthSauna @ReeseW @ChristiesInc @moonpay @YKarkai Plus IMO a potential @hudabeauty partnership opportunity….

27,"Building momentum to transition from ‘Project’ to ‘Brand’ will be the biggest challenge for most in this space. 

@worldofwomennft ticking all the right boxes in their journey. Incredible partnership with @hellosunshine and @ReeseW  👋🏼 ☀️ https://t.co/VH4QlsITxm"
28,"@akshayakey @veefriends @10KTFshop It has to be expected, we are so so early in this space. It’s all a big risk. For me, past experience plays a big part In my decision making and I’m comfortable to back people who have already achieved success. To be involved in this space so early is a great opportunity imo"
29,"@akshayakey Experience, and previously running successful businesses. Hence my two most trusted projects are @veefriends and @10KTFshop"
30,"@akshayakey It only takes time for projects to be found out, hence why supporting projects that have teams behind them that you can trust and have runs on the board is the best strategy imo"
31,@garyvee 100% your correct @garyvee that many projects will fail in the space but the ones that succeed have every right to be worth what they are….. ⬇️ https://t.co/3pf4OfgFhI
32,"The space is evolving, people getting smarter. Projects now need to justify their worth more than ever before. We are starting to see the gap widening in the market and the leading projects are standing out more than ever. Will the projects you hold be relevant in 5 years time?"
33,"Well…No NFT presence like we may have hoped in the Half Time show… however… @Eminem has reminded the world how talented he is, and everyone out of this space who has jumped on his social media since is probably wondering what that @BoredApeYC is… 💭 https://t.co/p7WRwwTtsi"

Congrats @SassBAYC @TomatoBAYC @GordonGoner @CryptoGarga. 

Incredible 🙌🏼 https://t.co/3xb8w07PR9"
43,"The @worldofwomennft Brand is getting stronger, and the current floor price is starting to reflect that. A great success story for the entire NFT space that just shows what can happen if a project with great potential keeps reinvesting in itself. This was never a one day project. https://t.co/w5EmA4FChE"
44,"So this just happened…

60,@PepeVault @PixelMapNFT @pepe @al_fernandz @KenErwin88 Looks Great!!!!
61,"I really do feel history repeating itself with NFTs. Not only is this market impossible to predict short term, it’s also emotionally exhausting. The below is a great reminder for everyone. 
I back the projects with teams behind them that I can trust……with a long term view. 💭 https://t.co/o8NBjnhoM1"
62,@Pr1moMN Congratulations! That’s a great life changing story!
63,"Soon enough, the Traditional Art Space will take a real interest in the NFT Art Space. When this happens the most prestigious Galleries in the world will be holding NFT exhibitions. With this in mind , @FlowerGirlsNFT is by far the best placed in this space right now. https://t.co/HtcsQdh24c"
64,"Still feel many are sleeping on this…
Think of the recent stars who have joined the @BoredApeYC community. @Eminem @justinbieber to name a couple… @ApeInProd led by @Timbaland worth checking out. NFTs will be disrupting the Music industry sooner rather than later… https://t.co/aKFuPxEReV"

74,"Love this project..why? Because @FlowerGirlsNFT hits a completely different market from the rest and as this space continues to grow it will have opportunities like this.

92,@sendr0ck @worldofwomennft Love it!
93,The WoW Gala will be the flagship event for @worldofwomennft over the coming years so it’s no surprise at all to see sales like this now for Gala Women. This stunning Women just sold for 19eth. https://t.co/bWR7Oi9vXn

99,"Love this strategy by @10KTFshop …

We are 4 months into this project and now the most loyal holders are the ones most likely to be most rewarded…. 

Best way to keep community engaged and loyal regardless of floor prices…

I’m certain many projects will follow this path.. https://t.co/wKQTL6766U"
