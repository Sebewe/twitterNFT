4,"@0xinc what features are you looking for, and mobile or desktop? A way to display NFTs on mobile and a quick way to sort through your own?"
5,Love my HashCrash #142. One of two pieces I've collected from @beervangeer (see both here: https://t.co/HpRt9hBK3o ) https://t.co/kfAHu5cB3m

8,"@jsngr @leftclick_art, an interactive art viewer for static and generative art NFTs, built for desktop (macOS - currently on TestFlight) and web (coming very soon). Meant for showing NFTs in fullscreen slideshow mode on any TV/monitor/display"
9,"@shortstack_dan @leftclick_art Yes, your Nyan Cats are uploaded to IPFS as GIFs, so they are supported. Beeple pieces should be also uploaded to IPFS (mp4 video will be supported soon). We support both IPFS and HTTPS links (in general NFTs using HTTPS isn't great, but a separate topic)"
10,"@shortstack_dan @leftclick_art Yes. Fully animated in its original form, so any movies/animated gifs would display properly, and fit to whatever screen you give it (horizontal vs vertical stretching fills the aspect ratio). Art Blocks / other generative art pieces also display with full interactivity."
11,"@shortstack_dan @leftclick_art expecting to begin processing whitelisting other collections within the next few weeks (have to whitelist as these images are downloaded to your HDD, so for compliance/safety reasons downloading any airdropped NFTs is not done by default)"
12,@shortstack_dan So this is something that I've been building - @leftclick_art is currently available on TestFlight for macOS (Windows 10 builds are more experimental but also available). Currently only Art Blocks but in the process of adding standard IPFS-based NFTs + other gen art platforms
13,@shortstack_dan what if there was software out there that you could run on your laptop/desktop computer and screen cast to any TV to display your NFTs in slideshow mode? Portrait vs landscape mode then becomes a function of how your computer displays screens
14,"@shortstack_dan @gen_dot_art @opensea Yes, I believe you can mount some Frame TV models vertically. But you'd have to save your NFTs as jpegs and upload those so you'd lose out on the animated/generative parts of pieces as the Frame TV only displays still images AFAIK"
15,"@shortstack_dan @gen_dot_art @opensea I think most solutions currently out there for displaying NFTs digitally focus on custom hardware i.e. digital frames, but most of them are fairly small"
