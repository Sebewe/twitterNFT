20,"@garyvee One of the best stories in AI art is @DeepBlackAI - no human intervention, the AI creates and appraises the art and determines its style/movement. Only the AI decides what will be minted. Also an historical element, developed throughout 2018 and first minted in 2019. https://t.co/tG0UIRGXTy"
