@BoredApeYC #BAYC #MAYC https://t.co/TANkes4Jo6"
5,@ParallelNFT Good luck on pulls sir. I just got myself some too!
6,"@nftworldsNFT is a priceless assest. If I had to bet, 100 ETH floor is written. https://t.co/pzdciKhjpS"
7,Is this the greatest NFT trade of all-time? https://t.co/Nu33Xt3yYe
8,"This feels like ""study hall"" regulation. US is gonna research crypto, how to scale blockchain to support a FedCoin, keep it closed source, and centralized. Once that happens, create hard regulations on DeFi/Stables/NFTs. https://t.co/A3lMKmB8jD https://t.co/lBM8onipKe"
9,"3/ Holding onto your morals isn't easy in a dog eat dog market, but no amount of money is worth trashing your integrity. Anyways, just my rambling thoughts. Hope everyone is well. Peace and love."
10,"2/ Being on the sidelines recently, has made me thankful for doing my best to uphold my moral integrity. Watching so many people constantly print cash grabs, has made me more then once think about turning scummy to pull myself out of this rut."
11,"1/ Working hard to stay on the right path, keep my head clean, and work towards my goals. Mentally, the last few months have been hard, but coming out on the other side with perspective and gratitude."
12,@DrNickA Yikes
13,@zachxbt So many people are fucked lol
14,The people who promote crypto need to realize this is coming sooner rather then later. https://t.co/sXrKiRWiDy

17,"@yungcalc When I first discovered you, I honestly didn't care much for your personality, but you've come along way, and I can say I genuinely enjoy your content now. Happy for you sir!"
18,@zachxbt @coolcats @worldofwomennft https://t.co/tXRWD13wqI

20,@Zeneca_33 @Bitboy_Crypto @BoredApeYC @Pluto_Alliance @GutterCatGang @doodles The fact he has that up their over @coolcats https://t.co/xtneSHGxMu
21,Someone just bought 50 ETH of @tokenfy_ and staked all of it 👀👀👀👀
22,"@Dety0 Personally, if someone where to be in that position, it should be a paid advisor role, because if you are just shilling NFTs for money, and don't actually believe in the project long term, then you are just taking advantage of the people who follow you. Its gross negligence."
23,"@drunkassdinos Seen it minting on Etherscan, checked the website, realized this is extremely well put together, and gas was none existent when minting a large batch, plus free seemed like a no brainer. Congrats!"
24,@DrNickA Honestly a confusing purchase. Could have gotten 5 floor apes for the same price.
25,@TheScreamingMen Congrats sir you deserve it.
26,@TheMoonCarl *delete this tweet is what I think you meant to say
27,RT @ILikeNFTs: https://t.co/caUnUOtO0G
28,"@THump @beaniemaxi I hope you don't actually believe this idiot. If these allegations weren't true, he'd already doxxed himself, plain and simple. The devil is in the details sir."
29,@DrNickA @loomdart Just throw Inu behind it and its golden.
30,"https://t.co/UJOzYAu8Q1 
@thedivinenft is an amazing example of how crazy the NFT market is. Been out for months, just finally minted out and the volume is growing rapidly. Congrats to the team!"
31,"@W1ll1amEth @coolcatsnft Glad to see this found a good home. I minted this Cat, feels like forever ago now."
32,@DNPthree Facts sir
33,@itstylersays Money just makes you more of what you already are.
34,"@Stretch Yeah the SMG meta this season reminds me alot of when the drum gun first was introduced. Rate of fire needs serious adjusting, and bring back the fucking pump."
35,@AngelClarkSays Someone bought it and is currently enjoying it!
36,"@DiscoverXnft Facts but there is a market for ""Cute PFPs"" I still don't think there is enough supply to facilitate the amount of people yet to get into NFTs, especially with Twitter Verification around the corner. Also not excusing influencers using their followers as exit liquidity"
37,"@AngelClarkSays I minted a bunch of these at one point, what a mistake selling 😅"
38,"@AngelClarkSays God damn man, wilddddd"
39,"@tropoFarmer I've seen alot of these stories, of high-school kids turning $500 into an 8 figure portfolio on NFTs"
40,@Punk_2070 Because 90% of the projects launching are the same teams.
41,@JRNYcrypto The @AzukiZen ERC721A contract that decreases batched NFT mint gas prices. Its actually quite incredible
42,"https://t.co/uJVjR5Nccz
If future NFT mints are not using this contract for their launch, they simply don't care about you, and just want your money, plain and simple."
43,"@therealtblake Thats why I swept sir. I expect a similar run up. Waited a few days for degen flippers to get out and community to stabilize, seemed like a perfect entry."
44,@therealtblake ty sir
45,@andrwwang Thats why you are one of the best in this space. Choose to be the bigger person. You are stuff of legend sir.
46,"@Punk_2070 My bet will be on a shared market long term. Utility offered will matter, but as of right now, https://t.co/QvVykcOOwI will probably be the early market winner based off of more reach currently"

49,@FeeToken TY sir
50,"@FeeToken How does the airdrop itself work, is it based off the amount of gas you spent on NFTs? And how is that determined."

54,"@Punk_2070 You think everyone would be used to it right now. But the engagement farming is too good, gotta soak it up."
55,"@lordquas_eth All the @KaijuKingz PFP NFT influencers are legit some of the best people to follow in the NFT space. Smart, honest, guides their communities in the right direction, and always to the point. Well met sir."
56,"Bad press is still press @Pudgy_Penguins. Pretty brilliant, even tho it obviously wasn't planned like this. Pengu's will always be a mainstay in NFTs and will probably see a documentary one day about early NFTs, Pengu's being the front runner for the drama part of the doc."
57,@0xHamz https://t.co/JnZJSDuDtX
58,"@totdgbtagb @feeswtf Ideally no more then 10x, no sense in having massive supply if you dont need to, either way Im down with free money"
59,@DrifterShoots @VANS_66 @PureMichigan This is such a banger bro. Hope you enjoyed Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. Drove across that bridge 200+ easy. Much love sir
60,@Loopifyyy But everyones needs are different for sure. I think would be a good show of faith and commitment as well.
61,"@Loopifyyy Confident builders IMO take 0% for the first year, then maybe 1.5/2% after they deliver. An NFT project raises enough seed funds with the initial mint, to pay their employees, and build. Just this one mans opinion."
62,"While people were following this kind of influencer, people like @9x9x9eth @Punk_2070 @DanVerno were out here steering their communities in the right direction, do good by them. Just remember this shit in the future. Well done for putting a nail into the coffin @9x9x9eth https://t.co/h9UwlUBQGm"

84,"Beginning to see a trend from old #fortnite pros, getting into NFTs with their verified badges and cash grabbing all of the NFT promos. If I were you, I'd stay clear away from any old Fortnite pro shilling NFT bags. Just this man's opinion."
85,@Loopifyyy Its a good indicator that maybe those Christmas dinner talks with the schizo NFT trader might have worked

92,@andrwwang I still remember when you bought your 1/1. That night in the discord was amazing.
93,"@SlimHoods might be one of the biggest comebacks in the NFT space. Price dropped to .001 at one point and floor is now .2, impressive"
94,@Gfunkera86 @adidasoriginals 4378
95,"@beaniemaxi They do for sure. The recent adoption has more then proved that @BoredApeYC is a much more desirable asset then PUNKs and if something doesn't change, you will see other projects do the same, aka @doodles @coolcatsnft for example."
96,@beaniemaxi Can I ask why the sudden change on how you view PUNKs. A couple weeks ago you were rallying against the fud that was happening during the whales sale off.
97,@T_Mac303 What is it with all time shows always blowing the ending few episodes lol
98,@m0E_tv Its actually so enjoyable to play. Feels like PUBG and Rogue Company made a baby.
