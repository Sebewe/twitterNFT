How to Join?

Apply here: https://t.co/5k6zZxfpCV

We are minting Early Access NFTs for 25 excited groups of frens. The NFT gives you:

🔑 Access to NFT Squads 
🃏 Membership in our early community
🦸 Special TBA community superpowers https://t.co/ebIPwRYQlV"

Today, NFT Squads allows you to:

🪞 Purchase NFTs on OpenSea securely
⚡️ Vote on proposals and manage ownership quickly
🌈 Flex your squad NFT collection https://t.co/naSsXl4rcr"
13,"3/ 

With NFT Squads, we are all going to make it 🚀

NFT Squads make collecting, owning, and flexing NFTs with frens fun, fast, and easy.

Launch a simple Collector DAO to pool capital, share profits/risks and learn together. https://t.co/XPZddG6Ie9"
14,"2/ 

Why NFT Squads? 

Collecting NFTs with frens should be fun — but current experiences are NGMI.

😑 Painful flows over many UIs to buy an NFT
☠️ Coordinating frens to make decisions is chaos
📜 Managing contributions and ownership is manual"
15,"🚀NFT Squads are live! 🚀

Imagine turning your group chat into a Collector DAO. 

This is Squads.
