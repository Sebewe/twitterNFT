Good trades in the leading sectors should do fine.

8,@jaredctate I don't think it's worth calling everything at a 100% guarantee that these things will happen. It's important to understand the risks and potential outcomes. It's a hell of a lot easier to just be first with this stuff.

57,@the_chart_life Sorry to hear that Ian. He looks like a very good boy.
58,@_BirthByFire @LoganMohtashami The trade deficit means we're able to borrow our way to importing goods and services while we export the debt based dollars. How in the hell will a US company have any chance to compete with that playing field? They're going to be very competitive in order to make a profit.
59,"@_BirthByFire @LoganMohtashami Unfortunately this is a deep rooted problem. Having the USD as the global reserve currency caused the rapid outsourcing. Other countries can artificially suppress their wages, keeping production cost low. We're also running a structural trade deficit due to the dollar supremacy."
