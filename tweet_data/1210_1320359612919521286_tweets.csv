1,@latteicecoffee Why are people promoting Kevin and making the Pixelmon Founders even more richer after their $70M rug pull?
2,"We need good lawyers who can help defend the interest of the victims in the NFT space and punish the fraudsters.

It's time for the NFT space to set precedent against the rug pulls. https://t.co/pNXgucN3TW"
3,"@NFTherder @RealTokenomist @Pixelmon I'm not in NZ, but count on me in anything I could help to find that person to sue him for financial fraud. Hopefully the law would make him return the money to all his victims."

11,"@Zagreus64eth One of best articles I have read this year. You have a big future as a writer!
Thanks for sharing your journey!

Just curious, which discord server gave you  such great insights for your crypto investments?"
12,"@Alts_Anonymous @Coinbase_NFT Centralised exchanges target audience are  people that want to outsource the security of their assets or want a simple buy/sell process.

OS is none of them. It could be easily replaced by a decentralised exchange.

13,"Happy twosday everyone!

14,@DiscoverXnft This is just incredible. My biggest miss of the year. I was just one click away to buy it at 2 ETH😢
15,"@DPGSpurs @WillSMONG No, I said that a lot of portfolios could have the same transition from Bitcoin + alts to NFT + ETH. I didn't have a 100% transition.

I'd count Real Estate as a different asset with different utility and scarcity. 

I'm not sure about Bonds."
16,"@DPGSpurs @WillSMONG I understands Bitcoin use case and still have  exposure despite the fact that I think ETH could flip BTC. Predict something is really difficult.

I see Bitcoin as gold 2.0 and gold has $11T in MC. I see ETH as sort of S&amp;P500 which has a MC of $40T. That's my point."
17,"@DPGSpurs @WillSMONG The thing is that BTC is not longer competing against ETH. It is  competing against an army of ETH childrens(NFTs, DAOs, L2 tokens, Defi tokens...etc). Each of those children is grabbing a different type of audience to their ranks."
18,"@WillSMONG I don't know how ETH hasn't flipped BTC yet. 
I guess many portfolios had the same transition."
19,"@kerryflips Oh I see. It always good to take more precautions.
Thank you!"
20,"@kerryflips This is really helpful. Thanks for sharing these tips.

I got a question: What risk is mitigating the transfer wallet that can't be done by the mint or trade wallet?"
21,"@1dalehardiman Sorry, I don't get the challenge you are trying to do. People won't believe you if you don't say your moves before. 

I could do the same challenge, wait until a random  project makes a good run 200% and then said that I flipped it.🤷‍♂️"
22,"@natashalfawn Thanks for sharing your story! 
You are a warrior and huge inspiration for many people in the world!! https://t.co/IGIn5vaHTq"
23,"RT @itstimconnors: ETH dipped 8% today bcuz of this 
 https://t.co/prLf9SG9Hh"
24,"@LStehaye Difficult decision. Both have huge  growth potential. But decided to keep Azuki as the project is newer and still in an early discovery phase, which could lead to higher returns in the short term if the team get it right."
25,"Sold my CloneX #3444 because I urgently needed liquidity, it wasn't an easy decision. 

I'm a strong believer of this project and I'm hoping to get back as soon as I can."

27,@0xFablo The beauty of the free market. Good healthy  competition brings new benefits to the customers.
28,"@michael_gironda @NFT_Rasklekid @Crypto_Bull_NFT I have the same question. The community is great but the team...they are just ghosting and not delivering anything valuable. 

The team have earned at least $10M in royalties and initial sales. Where is that money being used?"
29,"@steveb_crypto @nftworldsNFT @iamarkdev Such a big regret not buying it. I got the mindset of ""waiting for the dip"" to buy and it  never happened 😅"
30,"@KingBlackBored Ser, Fren, LFG, DYOR, sweep the floor, fam"
31,@crispylines What about in their IG and LinkedIn name? Nobody has dare to cross that line yet.
32,"@CardilloSamuel @theRealDocRod @RTFKTstudios You could start with Clones but the solution could be scaled to be used in other NFT projects. 

You already have built a trusted brand. Use it to impact every corner of the NFT space🙂"
33,@IvabIvanIssac I meant over 1000 excluding gas🤣
34,@IvabIvanIssac I'm waiting for tips over 1000
35,"I turned on ethereum tips for my profile. I wonder when I'm going to get my first tips😛

#SendTips"
36,@RonnyyGuyy @NathanHeadPhoto They are including a lot of shitty project as their partners. That's bad for their reputation
37,"@NotTheDrPhil I've been following a couple of DAOs and noticed that the decision process is very slow,  which causes to slow down the delivery of any product.

This a disadvantage when the community need to be consulted for every minor decision."
38,"Are some founders of NFT projects the new politicians?

Worried about the # of rug projects in the space where founders act like politicians: promising but not delivering. Just stealing money. 

The worst is seeing holders acting like blinded voters giving them full support."
39,"@NugenCapital @GalyArtist @Crypto_Bull_NFT Slow rug. I saw a couple of red flags from the team at the beginning of January and decided to sell my 3 bulls. 

Best decision ever because used that money to buy one CloneX."
40,RT @robbyhammz: On the left is Tesla Model 3 and on the Right is the cheapest @AzukiZen for sale. A floor #Azuki is the same as a Tesla Mod…
41,@natashalfawn @RTFKTstudios @AZUKI Exactly!!
42,ENS and ArtBlocks don't count as they are not collectibles.
43,"Curious fact: Holders of CloneX by @RTFKTstudios are still the biggest holders of @Azuki.

726 unique CloneX holders have at least one Azuki.

Geographical barriers would decrease and more opportunities would be available anywhere in the world."

71,@phaaz @PuffYatty Yeah! Remember in 2017 all the rumours that  Coinbase was to list XRP and the price went so high lol
72,"@SteveG60117 @PuffYatty @vistalenft Well said. Azuki's team is amazing. However, they only have one month old, still need time to prove themselves as a project to surpass BAYC."

84,@FilmerNFT @galyverse @GalyArtist Well done! I got mine too: #4598
85,@Andres_Finance @galyverse @ethereum @VitalikButerin The devs didn't create an optimal smart contract to mint. They should have used the  ECR721A made by @AzukiZen  which made the mint step more optimal and way much cheaper.
