9,@CliveApestein @ABigThingBadly @0xApes_NFT What sense does it make to spend any time even replying to a tweet related to a project you feel this way about? It'd be difficult to put anything on your logic or reasoning at this point. Have a great day!

I don't need the interpretation, but that doesn't matter. The vast majority of people do. As far as the spin, the human element will always be there for better or worse."
46,"@0xVortex @1202reklaW @0xfruefrue @NFTethics To add, that means confirming the information as well. Whether that be through research or subpoenas of related parties."
47,"@0xVortex @1202reklaW @0xfruefrue @NFTethics No, it just has to have someone behind it. Whether it's passed off to a journalist or whoever. Information provided anonymously means nothing until someone is willing to pursue it in the open."
