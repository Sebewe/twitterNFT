1,This is so exciting — congrats on the raise @avichal! https://t.co/c48LqAu1tF
2,Congrats for the launch @__mikareyes ! Excited to read through my copy of the NFT Playbook... gated by an NFT! Thanks for all the advice with BUIDling @wagmify ! 🌕🌕🌕🌕 https://t.co/h6Z6UM3hly
3,"@nootrality That's @kunal_modi and our vision 🙂 we started with something super simple, https://t.co/frIE5LIzNn, but slowly thinking of what layers to add on top. Ideally, we can abstract out the trust/consensus layer and make it more familiar for web2 engineers."
4,"@thakkar_puru I always say startups are np-complete problems, there isn't a quick, deterministic solution. All we can do is use heuristics learned from the past and apply to the problem; last long enough, something good will come out."
5,"@nootrality That said, optimistically, I think we are still in the first innings and there is a lot to simplify. I don't think the outcome will be fully open data social networks but by simplifying we'll uncover new uses cases. One of the reasons why I am excited to build infra abstractions!"
6,"What we think is what we ship — writing things down in a structured way helps us think clearly, and ship clearly."
7,The social network blockchains are giving us assembly code in hopes that we'll create the new snapchat. This is not how it works.
8,"@adityaag It's always odd to remember how much duplication we have across china, russia and the west; we had to write the code that powers facebook from ground up three different times by three different teams of people"
9,"@adityaag Most of ex-soviet block has their own exact replacements for western products from eCom, to social networks, to netflix. Partly to minimize leverage for these exact situations, partly because there was a lot of money to be made by locally supported entrepreneurs."
10,"@juliangay Fair warning, I don't have a deep understand about the topic, but — would there be any benefit of storing the trained model on chain or have the training done via a contract? Could lead to a more trustless fraud detection model? Compute is probably too expensive for this happen."
11,"One interesting use case that comes to mind is fraud detection — currently the data is centralized across a few companies. If we had a shared model, would everyone benefit from contributing? @juliangay curious if you have thought about this 🤷‍♂️"
12,"What are some use cases that trustless, decentralized AI models can unlock? Is there a need for decentralizing GPUs?

13,It wasn't too long ago that Armenia had to fight foreign invaders to survive as a nation. My heart goes with all the Ukrainians fighting for their country. May peace prevail. War shouldn't have a place in 21st century.
14,"Much better to selectively add users early on, understand retention, what's valuable and only then optimize for hyper growth. Learned this the hard way."
15,Quickly acquiring the wrong set of users is a surefire way   to lose all of them — the shear noise also makes it hard to know if you're building something useful.
16,"Acquiring users with airdrops is like opening your window; you get lots of fresh air, but also mosquitoes."
17,I should own this tweet @lensprotocol #digitalroots sig:0x30257ea5c215d65a0f0bea8642c7d27cc6dc0af363013a7ba51c6ac199b3d05810761b2e993f9012502100ba627e81e3eef37a96c4f92b34a018a66d7b4597701b https://t.co/j1YIA0pZoB
18,"Need all hands on deck for combating climate change — it's good see @TheHeliosDAO using the power of DAOs to invest in carbon sequestration, not only as a way to mitigate climate change, but also to give back to investors fueling the change ☀️ congrats on the alpha launch! https://t.co/7vSjzz5lus"
19,@manishsinhaha I agree - simplifying the tech should enable significantly more new &amp; exciting applications!
20,Denver here we come! @kunal_modi #ETHDenver
21,@0xamand Has the snow storm started?
22,@kunal_modi @DesignFrens Gm @badboybrebre  😜
23,@jeremygoldbrg can't wait to know who 😉
24,"@everton_dev Depends on the size of the co; any new startups/smaller co's should be purely on Swift, and ideally on SwiftUI and can achieve majority of product challenges. That said, some FANG co apps are still on obj-c since Swift perf hasn't caught up."
25,@yoyothesheep @0xWhiteLotus @kunal_modi @badboybrebre @solana @metaplex @kunal_modi you wanna tell us? 😛
26,@jonjyan We’ll be coming! @kunal_modi @__mikareyes
27,"In the meantime, we have been open sourcing our NFT APIs into Wonka to make it super easy for others to mint on @metaplex's Candy Machine. https://t.co/frIE5LIzNn"
28,"We'll be announcing the launch date soon! You can follow our twitter at @wagmify or join our telegram: https://t.co/cyXymDSNq5. Our progress couldn't have been possible without all the help from @__mikareyes, @jordaaash, @qualiaspace, @pencilflip, @nick___cruz and @andydrewie! https://t.co/hhS8DuR2pS"
29,"After a bit more fine tuning, we'll be launching Season 1 with total of only 128 #wagmiis that you can mint loosely based on your appearance. The genesis holders will get to help us guide the future seasons — deciding on more themes, styles, accessories and AI models 🙂 https://t.co/a2zQw8pU2c"
30,"We also started adding additional accessories and cute traits. From scuba gear to flowers to earrings, our #wagmiis started getting more color while still preserving personal traits from the initial selfie. https://t.co/TF1DU1Xwr0"
31,@badboybrebre joined in and encouraged us to look into 3D avatars — our little #wagmiis got another dimension!  They started looking a lot better but both design and engineering became even more challenging; how do we draw the back of your hair with just a front facing selfie? 🤔 https://t.co/cmAhVa0pdz
32,"The early iterations weren't very exciting. We wanted to look at a photo, detect facial features like skin tone, hair style, eyes, etc. then map them onto a 24x24 pixel grid 👾 our journey took us to training models on thousands of selfies and many trial and errors 😓 https://t.co/qN1ayTSOhr"
33,"Launching a sneak peek of our experimental NFT project https://t.co/VlJbiAEQzp 🤓 @kunal_modi, @badboybrebre &amp; I have been building a tool that uses a selfie and AI to mint a pixelated look-alike on @solana @metaplex. We call them #wagmiis. Can you guess who this one is based on? https://t.co/pEe4CfZHBT"
34,@ardriveapp @ArweaveTeam Thanks @ardriveapp ! Are there APIs we could use?
35,Is there an easy way to find all @ArweaveTeam files associated with a private key?
36,Do you think our grandchildren will inherit our private keys?
37,"RT @elonmusk: Most news outlets attempt to answer the question: “What are the worst things happening on Earth today?”

38,RT @waitbutwhy: 21 thoughts from 2021 I'd like to take into 2022: https://t.co/hdHCgGiYVj
39,"@alfongj @vercel @ArweaveTeam Ah, didn't even think about that 🤦‍♂️ have you found any scripts that does this for you? Given a keypair, creates the encrypted file, stores a shorter key in .env. Would be nice actually 😛 the next.js tutorial but automated"
40,"@alfongj @vercel @ArweaveTeam Yeh, that next's their suggestion; we were just too lazy to do it. This might be wrong, but I suppose you're also decreasing the strength of the key by decreasing key size to fit into .env right? Seem like the example RSA is 128 bit 😢

https://t.co/8cVNm6CfRt"
41,Funny enough we ended up removing a lot of the other nice to have .env variables to finally make enough room for the keypair. This is not really sustainable.
42,"TIL: If you're building on @vercel, there is a 4kb size limit on env variables. This makes it hard to store keypairs for things like enabling @ArweaveTeam API access since most RSA keys are usually ~3.3kbs. Is there a better way to access private keys securely from a server?"
43,"When in doubt, optimize for learning. You're either building or learning from your customers, everything else is wasting time."
44,@alexandraj777 @southpkcommons Welcome @alexandraj777 !
45,@__mikareyes We are starting with telegram channel only. Will report back soon 🙂
46,"@pzakin Problem is real. Historically successful IDEs have solved it with plugins/becoming a platform. Can see this play out in Figma, Eclipse, VSCode, etc. Maybe the question is if you can 10x with a custom built and if there is a market big enough for it"
47,@adityaag Have a recurring IRL day setup on the calendar - a) will force you to actually make time and meet up consistently and b) give you the more daily psychological benefit of knowing that IRL is just around the corner. Learned this living with a remote family spread around the globe
48,Be lightning fast to learn as a founder — that’s the greatest asset you have.
49,@sjwhitmore can’t tell if real or generated 😛 https://t.co/FgTickNW9p
50,Always wise to only test in production https://t.co/ENkwprhzXD
51,@Flynnjamm wait till you get to L3s 🤯🌀 https://t.co/P0T1TVKnzf
52,Congrats to @pencilflip  &amp; @petrichorate  for the launch 🚀 awesome to see an artist first NFT platform take off! https://t.co/8zLq6iiQQZ
53,Startups choose their founders like wands choose their owners 🪄 there is something magical about finding product founder fit. It just clicks — you are meant for it.
54,"Summarized some of my recent learnings on minting NFTs through dApps on @solana and @metaplex. A lot of the Candy Machine NFT logic was simplified by building on Wonka JS, so hopefully, others can build even faster. DM if you need help getting started 🙂
https://t.co/Ta0uBHh1Nh"
55,"Lastly, getMintMetadata(..) gets us all the data related to the mint. Some of the data structures are a bit confusing, but the example has access to the most important pieces. Checkout metadata.tsx for the example code. https://t.co/h8Cxb2CpPW"
56,"getCandyMachineMints(..) fetches all the existing mints — unfortunately going through the @metaplex API is quiet slow, so @kunal_modi  and I have been working on a super fast indexer (coming soon!) Checkout mint.tsx page for details. https://t.co/666k07hzWn"
57,"Minting with Wonka is wrapped around a single function, mintCandyMachineToken(..); the example in mint.tsx will walk you through from authenticating to minting. https://t.co/bk0EPEuMsZ"
58,Using getCandyMachineState(..) can fetch how many more mints are available and see if it's sold out. This is generally useful on landing pages. https://t.co/yFmOC7CqF2
59,One more update this week — we added @nextjs example for interacting with @metaplex's Candy Machine through Wonka! Easy walkthrough for interacting with all the NFT APIs. Should be fairly straightforward to build your own store and mint flow from here! 🚀https://t.co/GeND7f4hAg https://t.co/7qSlydm6N4
60,"@AniketHanda @ArweaveTeam @ardriveapp Arweave is for purely decentralized storage, but doesn’t provide provenance ie you still need Solana/chain_x to mint/sell/trade even if you can have a URL pointing to Arweave. What I was proposing was trying to combine both storage and minting on a single chain"
61,"Wouldn't it be awesome if there was a chain that combined storage and provenance at an affordable cost? Digital assets should be completely stored on chain, this should increase the quality of the assets. https://t.co/i54Fv4Oe8C"
62,Is it just me or did @StackOverflow stop ranking answers by number of votes?
63,@AzianMike @kunal_modi Thanks @AzianMike 🙏
64,"Using the CLI as a quick way to interact with Candy Machine and test out Wonka JS has been helpful internally. @kunal_modi and I thought it might be useful for others as well, so we published it. Thanks to @AzianMike for taking it for an early spin!"
65,"We wrapped Wonka JS for @metaplex in a simple CLI that you can install as a binary via NPM. Typing ""wonka-cli mint ..."" will mint you a new NFT on @solana! 🙂 You can also use it to get candy machine state, list all mints and and fetch NFT metadata —https://t.co/uCjz87uJP8 https://t.co/lrPg7S8dKZ"
66,"Better yet, when can we have crypto native notifications. There should be some way for dapps to reach out to wallets. https://t.co/R5cWxoXUZd"
67,"As much as NFTs promise to provide additional revenue streams for creators, the reality is that majority still goes to studios with large marketing budgets — we need better playbooks for building &amp; launching successful projects! Excited to see @__mikareyes's playbook soon 🙂 https://t.co/VbzHLzeFr2"
68,@gerta_ma @rhomsany …what was the tip? 😛

70,RT @Blockworks_: Coinbase CEO: NFTs will onboard the next billion crypto users https://t.co/rTlQ6yQY8y
71,"@alfongj @metaplex I agree; some wrapper that handles the logic in a simple way would be great. After playing with both of the CMUI and CLI examples, I eventually wrote up a super simple one here: https://t.co/RbiLqW1VbE

But ideally, I can just `npm install solana-transactions` 🙂"
72,"It's really interesting to see the new wave of evolutionary NFTs — breaking the bounds of static PNGs, we now have NFTs that grow and change over time 🤯 congrats for all the good progress @qualiaspace! Can't wait for mint day 😍🌱 https://t.co/DW5ZorcBkF"

75,@noahmacca Every morning I bug @kunal_modi with ideas I came up while running 😛
76,"10/ More on the learnings side, I realized how hard it is to build on top of a new experimental layer. By the time I was done with the first version, Candy Machine v2 came out and I had to start over. Downstream bugs also slowed us down significantly 😔"
77,"9/ That said, lots of work is left to be done. We need to add support for whitelists, custom mint tokens as well as captcha. Error handling is WIP. Happy to add if the community is excited about it! Feel free to contribute as well, happy to onboard ou &amp; code review ❤️"
78,"8/ We have 3 super easy functions: mintCandyMachineToken() mints you a token, getCandyMachineMints() gets you all the existing mints, getCandyMachineState() gets you the state of the CM. That's it. See readme for details: https://t.co/oDUQSgHa4U"
79,"7/ So this leaves you to write your own JS logic and it's tough. The web and github is full of incomplete implementations adding to the pain! That's where Wonka comes along 🍫 At least for now, it's an easy way to integrate with Candy Machine if you're building your own web app."
80,"6/ In the meantime, there is a new awesome project called Candy Machine UI that's in the works right now, but unfortunately, it's not ready yet! https://t.co/eFkWKinzER"
81,"5/ You can also take the course at @_buildspace that provides pretty good overview of the wiring to get candy machine working: https://t.co/xFxdIpdSbK ( thanks to @sannykimchi for the rec!). That said, ideally, people can start hacking without needing an entire course."
82,"4/ To use candy machine, you can use the CLI provided by @metaplex, but you still need to figure out the appropriate wiring if you want to mint in your own web app. There isn't an easy way to do this other than reverse engineer the CLI tool 😢https://t.co/3C6kipNCVx"
83,"3/ Just to see the complexity of the system, you can skim through @pencilflip's breakdown of candy machine below. Candy Machine is robust, but it comes at a cost of complexity. It takes time to understand. https://t.co/l0OylAZdxS"
84,"2/ Candy Machine itself is a @solana program built in Rust, which means it doesn't by default provide simple JavaScript APIs to call into it. @anchorlang can be used to make RPC calls into it with JS, but it still requires a lot of work to understand how to structure the code 😢"
85,"1/ Where @metaplex provides the foundational building blocks for minting NFTs (metadata storage, mint ownership, etc.), Candy Machine adds a layer on top to provide whitelisting, bot protection, total scarcity, etc. see: https://t.co/cgEpFjRISB"
86,"We built a JS wrapper around @metaplex's Candy Machine so you can easily use it to mint NFT from you apps! It's called Wonka and you can install it via npm 🙂 Check out the repo here, https://t.co/frIE5LIzNn. Fun background on building this 👇 https://t.co/Yu9DuhY9zn"
87,@NoubarTedjirian @kunal_modi Maybe something @MariamGyulumyan can add to @carrot_lucky 😛
88,"@NoubarTedjirian We also had badges like ""Python Committer"" or ""Dead Code Society"". These were big bragging points, and might have as well been represented as NFTs! I bet this could be a fun cultural norm in new web3 companies! What do you think @kunal_modi ?"
89,"@NoubarTedjirian At facebook, each employee's profile had a line about how much longer they have been at the company compared to others — ""More than 87% of all employees"". It was a bragging point to hit 90s. The company was growing fast, so it wasn't too hard in the early days!"
90,"@pencilflip @redacted_j Hm, let me see if I can find anything interesting. So far, just extracted out some of the logic from CMUI, but it feels fragile 😢"
91,"Extracted and well tested transactions lib that handles retry logic would definitely be helpful on my end. I just want to kick off a mint transaction, don't want to reinvent the retry logic. Also, would be helpful refactor on the @metaplex repo."
92,It's interesting to see a both Candy Machine UI as well as Metaplex CLI use a separate transactions wrapper with duplicate retry logic. @pencilflip/@redacted_j any thoughts on created a stand alone NPM wrapper? See https://t.co/knT9eBrVNW and https://t.co/67ftyvSjok.

97,@gracew09 I would actually love to send a poke NFT with a single tap to a friend's ENS address 🤘
98,@gracew09 That's seems like a great MVP 😛
99,"Awesome write up on Candy Machine V2. Will spend today doing a bit of a deep dive. Three things that are exciting: 
- Built in on-chain captcha that prevents bot sniping
- Randomized mint indexes for protecting rarities
- On-chain whitelist support 🤌
