Damn excited for @levelingupNFT and all that is to come🥳

Thanks @kashviETH for introducing me to…"
3,"By the way, we're going to give away 1 @levelingupNFT 'Magical' Hero to one lucky winner. To enter:

- Follow @levelingupNFT and @ericosiu 
- RT this
- Tag 3 friends"
4,"Make sure you follow @levelingupNFT for more updates. 

My goal isn't to 'moon' short-term. It's to 'moon' long-term. 🚀🌕"
5,"5/ Future plans

We plan to create PFPs that can 'level up', games, business utilities, and more. It takes years to build something great.

Just understand that we have urgency with our actions, but a long-term outlook on results."
6,"4/ Hard copy of 'Leveling Up' book 

If you're early in your career and want a primer on personal growth with a touch of gamification, this is it for you. I spent a lot of my life playing games and I view life as a game. Makes it more fun that way. 😉 https://t.co/Ukgn2rRaUK"
7,"3/ Free education

We are including our $2,500 course, Leveling Up School, which helps people build their first business for free. This comes from yours truly, with years of operating experience.

How's that for value? But there's still more!"
8,"2/ Free PFP + Mintpass

Although our NFT comes with the animated 'Guide' NFT, we have genesis PFPs coming (that we're already working on). Instead of charging current holders, we're giving it away for free (just cover gas) + they have first dibs. https://t.co/lVs480eR5i"
9,"1/ Live conference

We already have a conference booked in Austin Texas for April 27th. Instead of just giving 'access' to the event, we're giving holders access to their first event for free.

That alone covers the cost of the NFT. But wait, there's more. https://t.co/dd53d7LNQN"
10,"The bar is being raised for all NFT projects. Whether it's the art or the utility, what's clear is that this is going to be better for the ecosystem as a whole.
