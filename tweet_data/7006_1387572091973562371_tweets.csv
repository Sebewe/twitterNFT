1,"@PtakTestKitchen I love how everything has a long name that gives it character. First boss, Godrick the grafted for example."
2,@0xHammond I reject your hypothesis sir. It's booming now more than ever imo
3,@steven_schill ill never forget the fiasco of this drop... One of my first mod jobs...
4,"People still look at me funny when I say "" I trade Jpegs"" or inform them of NFTs. Some people refuse to get a digital wallet. This confirms how early we are and how much progress needs to be made. The future is so bright!"
5,"NFTs act as a culture arm of art and creative. For the first time in histroy a person is able to showcase digital ownership. Artists are also in control of their art, able to take royalties and communicate directly with their fan base."
6,A lot of things happening with #Ethereum  and #NFTs  remind me of the .com boom. Heaps of people saying the internet will never take off. The power of Ethereum alone is a game changer and technical feat that helps so many organisations with decentralized apps and smart contracts.
7,"@GRRMspeaking Well done sir, heavily enjoying the game. The lore and your writing is one of the best parts :)"
8,I have had to do a lot of hard things in my life. Defeating Godrick the Grafted in #eldinring @Fromsoft_US was one of them!
9,@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN I like how you get the BR version. So hard to go back to dvds. Hope it was a treat!

96,20/ I cant fucking wait to see what else NFTs bring forward and really do think 2022-2023 will be the year of NFT. With film NFTs not far behind!
97,19/ As an arist that has been screwed over by distributors NFTs provide the smart contract to ensure we get paid our royalties.
98,18/ Innovation takes time and as NFTs has changed my life I am sure it will change many.
99,"17/ My research has found that the #diffusion of #innovation  takes time. And for NFTs as more and more people use it. Make money from it. Show its use cases in the form of community, digital asset, digital flex and smart collectable to name a few. Many more will come."
