Oh wait, you aped in during March of 2021?  Wow, you must be a sage by now.  Your infinite wisdom and experience know no bounds.

3,"Just because someone has a @BoredApeYC PFP doesn't automatically make them a Web 3 guru or crypto expert. 

As a general rule of thumb, you shouldn't endorse/subscribe to an anon because they own an expensive NFT.  Most of them simply got lucky.  

Please think for yourselves 🐑"
