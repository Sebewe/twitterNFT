98,@cathsimard_ @cathsimard_  apologies if this came off offensive-- I posted because I wanted people to start shouting out other top level female photographers. I myself was fatigued hearing only Justin and Drift considered at the top. Clearly this isn't the case and I'm glad it's being said

I myself was fatigued hearing only Justin and Drift. I'm glad the post is doing that; may be been unnecessary to sound objectively J + D at the top
