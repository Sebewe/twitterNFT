8,"@DiscoverXnft The growth of this account changed my perspective of Twitter completely. You proved high-quality meme / shitposting is more potent than lengthy, genuine alpha. We don’t all need to be so serious. A true man of the people. Congrats &amp; well done bro! ✊"

Only a few minting on RMRK it seems, but will be surely growing with time, I've heard good things about their psy art community."
19,"@GydravlikS Yes, I agree! And that's not to be confused with toxic positivity, as you shouldn't deny your negative feelings, but you shouldn't dwell on them for too long either, as it drains your energy. Challenging times are inevitable for anybody, but each person interprets it differently."
20,"Want to stay up-to-date on the awesome Psychedelic / Visionary artists of https://t.co/cEL8Cg8Re4 and how the initiative evolves?

21,"Gm. My heart goes out to everyone right now! ❤️

Declaring a war seems so insane to me... But with that being said, I'm confident younger generations will not make the same mistakes.

Even more than our tech, we need to evolve our worldviews - away from hate &amp; towards Love!! ☮️"

49,"PsyNFTxyz is a showcase of the incredible talent in the Visionary Art community.

With that being said, it's NOT a comprehensive list of psy-artists. There are still many skilled artists which have not been added (yet).

The site will continue to grow with time.

Made with love!!"
