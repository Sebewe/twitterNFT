2,"@peter Love it, have you considered career switch to marketing? We have a role open you know 🤪"
3,"Fun @sardineai fact of the day:

There's not 1 type of Sardine but 21 different types. That's a ""phishy"" fish.

Thanks @peter for that hat tip 🙌🐟

16,@sbyrnes @maiab @FlurryMobile Agree with you @maiab. It's also companies which didn't hit their ultimate potential and employees were hungry to start something and make it even bigger
17,"@packyM Your portco should just out execute the competition. In cases like this, I like to imagine that no one can steal ideas in your mind that you haven't shared yet. I am sure your portco has ideas and intangibles that are so innate that no one can steal"

👀 detected over 60% of ACH fraud at a neobank based on user behavior at time of onboarding, even before connecting to a bank account."
60,"7) Some stats and we’re just getting started:

🚀  50+ customers signed in Q4

💰 Protected $40B worth of transaction value from fraud - 80x increase over last year

📈 Increased card approval rates from 65% to 91% at a crypto exchange, while reducing fraud rates from &gt;2% to &lt;1%"

71,"@Mira404 Absolutely, was our pleasure with the insights we could offer cc @adityagoeleth Let us know if we could be of help anytime 🙌"
72,"11/ Don't let FinTech fraud derail your growth. Come talk to us @sardineai

If you liked this thread, follow me for more ""phishy stories""."
73,"10/ Stories like these are why at @sardineai we designed our fraud prevention platform from the ground up.

Our behavior-based platform detects fraudulent sign-ups: whether made by bots, data centers, emulators, virtual machines, and device farms — before they cause damage."
74,9/ Another way to achieve this level of unity could involve having both leaders of the Fraud and Growth teams report to the head of a business unit.
75,"8/ Place your organizational structures in alignment:

When I was at @coinbase, my Data Science team was  renamed to “Risk and Growth,” and we became responsible for both maximizing the metrics around the company’s referral programs as well as minimizing the fraud rates."
76,"7/ The answer is to align incentives by having company-wide metrics that balance both growth and fraud rates. 

Here’s one example: Reduce and maintain fraud rates at less than 20 basis points (BPS) while increasing the 90-day LTV from the current $80 to $100."
77,"6/ Align your internal stakeholders by using proper metrics:

if your fraud team only cares about reducing fraud rate, that’s just half the battle. If your growth team only cares about increasing sign-ups (w/o looking at quality of  sign-ups), that’s also half the battle."
78,"5/ Incentivize with premium features instead of cold cash:

Instead of offering both the referee and referral $5 for a sign-up, give them both some credits for using your product instead. eg $5 of free instant FX conversions, 5 free ATM withdrawals, or 5 fee-free crypto buys."
79,"4/ Add fraud rates to your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) to Lifetime Value (LTV) formula

No point in launching a growth program if you have a leaky funnel or if most of your CAC dollars are going straight into fraudsters’ pockets."
80,"3/ With @PayPal's challenges in mind, I thought I’d share a few thoughts about how FinTech and crypto founders can prevent their customer acquisition programs from getting derailed. 

Here are 4 ways for FinTech leaders to keep fraud out of the equation:"
81,"2/ The main lesson based on my years of experience fighting fraud at @coinbase, @RevolutApp  and now @sardineai, is the following: 

""If you are leading a FinTech or a crypto company, you can’t let fraud blindside you. It will be a costly oversight"""
82,"1/ During an earnings call this week, @PayPal  admitted that 4.5 million of its account sign-ups were fraudulent. If you ever needed proof that FinTech fraud is out of control, this was it. Following the call, PayPal’s stock dropped 25 percent.

83,"@Mira404 Thank you for sharing this. So true. Often the whole industry gets caught up in the media hype cycle that more $$ raised must imply success. 

Really impressed by what you have built at Mos!"
