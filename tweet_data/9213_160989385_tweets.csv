48,"Remember: WAGMI

Healthy people make better decisions. Rest, research, don't risk it.

20/🧵"
49,"IRL

IRL means In Real Life, otherwise known as the world beyond OpenSea, Twitter and Discord.

It is not recommended to spend too much time there.  IRL does not have sufficiently good JPGs.

19/🧵"
50,"Delist 

Delist your NFTs from Opensea (no longer offer them for sale) because prices are rising rapidly and they might get sold and market expectations of their value has changed.

""Golden Snail 5ETH floor.  Delist!""

Also related to: ""Hide your JPGs""

18/🧵"
51,"Roadmap

The set of activities an NFT project (usually PFP) will plan to do to add value to a community.   

Roadmaps are viewed as desirable in PFP projects and insulting to ask for in art projects.

Needs some care to not accidentally violate securities laws

17/🧵"
52,"Sweep the Floor

The act of sweeping all the floor (lowest) priced NFTs in a collection into your wallet.   Often the step before discovering your bags are too heavy.

""Just swept the floor on the Silver Snail!""

16/🧵"
53,"DAO

Decentralized Autonomous Organization.   Smart contracts with their own tokens and governance that own assets and take actions.    Endless potential, but  Eyesfor the SEC

""I am launching my hoodie nerd glasses DAO next week""

15/🧵"
54,"Floor Price

The lowest available asking price on OpenSea / Larvalabs/etc either for a collection as a whole or for a subset of the collection.

""Golden Snails have hit a 3ETH Floor, but Golden Snail Nerd Glasses are 12ETH floor this morning""

14/🧵"
55,"Right Click Save As

Every non-NFT person's first ""gotcha"" move when learning about NFTs - demonstrating their vast technical capacity to download an image from a web browser.

Civilian: ""I Right Click Saved 6375 and now it is my PFP""
6375: ""Go right ahead""

13/🧵"
56,"Liquidity

Available ETH to buy JPGs.   This is an impossible state of being.   Any available ETH converts into JPGs immediately so everyone is a state of perpetual illiquidity.

12/🧵"
57,"PFP

Profile Picture.   The punks, apes, cats, dogs, skeletons and so on, that we all use in our proto-metaverse of Twitter and Discord.

""That golden snail PFP is sick""

11/🧵"
58,"Mint

The act of initially issuing a piece of art on the blockchain, either by the artist or the collector.

""Wow, beautiful picture.  Mint it!""

10/🧵"
59,"Probably Nothing

""probably nothing"" means ""probably something"".  It is the polite way to FOMO, with just barely some plausible deniability.

""Visa bought a punk.   Probably nothing""

9/🧵"
60,"1:1 Art

Art where each piece is unique (1 of 1).   This can be thought in contract to PFP and Generative Art collections that range from 200 to 10,000 pieces typically.

""1:1 szn is coming soon""

8/🧵"
61,"Looks rare

Rarity is often a driver of value in this space.   Used ironically.

[posts picture of steak]
""Looks rare""

7/🧵"
62,"McDonald's

Our backup career plan in case the NGMI scenario comes true

""Sold a Fidenza for 5ETH.  Applying now to McDonald's""

6/🧵"
63,"Cope

The opposite of FOMO.

Failing to buy an NFT because one is coping with one's earlier error of not FOMOing at 1/10th the price.

""I know Golden Snails are up 50x and heading to Christie's, but I didn't like the launch so staying out""
""OK, LOL, cope""

5/🧵"
64,"FOMO

The Fear of Missing Out.

Buying an NFT because you are afraid of missing out on the next big thing.

4/🧵"
65,"NGMI

Not Going To Make It.

i.g He sold his meebit for less than what he bought it for- NGMI

3/🧵"
66,"Most important thing.

GMI / WAGMI

""Gonna Make It"" / ""We All Gonna Make It""
