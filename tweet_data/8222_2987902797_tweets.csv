You represent a core web3 protocol and your public statements…"
43,"RT @m1guelpf: ✨ Made a lil website where you can see who you're currently delegating your $ENS to.

Delegates hold power over the @ensdomai…"

53,"@PICT_ASX i live with 4 other people, each of whom uses a variety of latency sensitive applications (gaming, voip calls, ssh sessions, etc). any sort of dropout or ping spike, while maybe not an inconvenience for everyone, is almost always for someone."

59,@nicksdjohnson fibre runs to the the front of the house but there's copper going into the house
60,"@mattwood_dev in australia if you’re way out you need to pay literally $100k+ to get fibre, most people in the country are either on fixed wireless or satellite. maybe look into starlink?

71,"@gtmcknight anyone can set any ENS name as their twitter name. we were looking at using the twitter text records, but that would make the leaderboard less accessible (especially with gas prices recently). if twitter implements ENS name verification though, we’ll add that to the site."
