0,@AnthonyLeeZhang We all try our best to give our kids the tools to thrive based on our own life experiences. Unfortunately the world we grew up with no longer exists. And all the rules change so our advice is irrelevant.
1,"@AnthonyLeeZhang Many Asian immigrant parents went through trauma. Cultural Revolution, Korean War, Vietnam War. Many had wealth suddenly stripped away. No sense of security.

You’re in a foreign, potentially racist country. No matter what happens, at least they can’t take away your kid’s degree."

8,RT @llpresswell: .@DangerWillRobin keeps going on podcasts and talking about the founding of @d_fdao so i keep having to RT his web3 gaming…
9,"12/ Listen to the full episode where Will talks to us about:
- web3 gaming guilds
- how @darkforest_eth works
- forming @d_fdao
- @alliancedao accelerator for the top 1% Web3 founders

https://t.co/IUf6iVIin8"
10,"11/ Together, they achieve the unimaginable. https://t.co/2azkXliOV7"
11,"10/ Will discovers @zhayitong. Through his blog about captaining an empire in Dark Forest. Also ex-Coinbase - UX/UI.

Will enrolls @TheDavidZhou &amp; @cha0sg0d_. Straight out of college. With actual time to play the game. 

And @llpresswell who becomes their media arm. https://t.co/Oy6NPiFhIm"
12,"9/ Unable to break the top 30, Will finds @Manan19 ranked high on the Dark Forest leaderboards and DMs him on Twitter. Turns out Manan is a managing engineer at Coinbase. Manan joins and provides the plugins. https://t.co/lxKCjVnhq8"
13,"8/ With no coding abilities or time. No chance at winning the game. Will decides to recruit a top-tier guild.

His first recruit is @omarish. 100x engineer. ex-Coinbase, ex-EIR at Paradigm. He sets them up with AWS. https://t.co/GD8LEq4xmq"
14,"7/ What players do to win is to write scripts.

Better UX. Better UI. Faster Experience. The games are no longer played by humans. They're played by robots and the players are there to maintain them. https://t.co/1ePee6MywR"
15,"6/ @darkforest_eth is a Web3 game where you conquer planets to build empires. Since you can interact directly with the smart contract, hacking becomes part of the game. https://t.co/pMJiP98ceJ"
16,"5/ Guilds that Build.

Developer guilds that build alongside the creators of the game. 

Will's Dark Forest guild @d_fdao is one of those guilds."
17,"4/ Guilds that Show.

Guilds like @HoogaGaming @lorcan_gg create spectacle. Pro players who play tournaments as performers."
18,"3/ Guilds that Shill.

Guilds like @YieldGuild @ReadyPlayerDAO onboard new players by providing scholarships. The amount of players they have give them incredible leverage. 

They can point their players to any new IP and make it a hit. 
A marketing arm for Web3 games."
19,"2/ There are three types of guilds forming in Web3 games.

1. Guilds that Shill
2. Guilds that Show
3. Guilds that Build"
20,"1/ Gaming guilds are the kingmakers of Web3 games.

@DangerWillRobin (@alliancedao)  has built the most fascinating guild for the most fascinating Web3 game 🧵👇: https://t.co/EoMCo1Coal"
21,"@MelissaZhang13 @bonfire_tweets Melissa's Coinbase experience and @matt__alston's time building Uber's loyalty program makes them the ideal founders to tackle this problem. And a perfect company for @ljin18 and @VariantFund's thesis.

“It seems that Ukraine has gained the sincerity and attention of the entire normal and civilized world.

What is the practical result?

SWIFT.

To disconnect Russia from the international interbank network. This is billions and billions of losses for Russia.” https://t.co/OyRD6Ujygw"

“Thanked our friend Erdogan for the unwavering support. To our independence and territorial integrity. We agreed that today the ban on the passage of Russian warships in the Black Sea is extremely important.

They did it.” https://t.co/wIOoaAy4Zi"

“Ukraine’s readiness to defend its state. Our solidarity with each other and courage. Have disrupted the scenario of occupation of our country.

So it is not surprising that such people always have friends more powerful than enemies.” https://t.co/4BTguXls4C"

“We have withstood and successfully fended off the enemy’s attacks. 

We messed up their plans.

Anyone who can return to Ukraine, come back to defend Ukraine.

All friends of Ukraine who want to join the defense, come. We will give you arms.” https://t.co/ZezVAmHaYo"

“The head of government is here.
The head of the president’s office is here.
Prime Minister Shmyhal is here.

The President is here.

Our soldiers are here.
Our citizens are here.
We are all here defending our country. And it will stay that way.” https://t.co/hoqXVeKxfe"

“There is a lot of fake information on the Internet right now. Saying that I am calling our army to lay down its arms. And that evacuation is underway.

“I remain in the capital. My family is also in Ukraine. My children are in Ukraine. My family are not traitors, they are citizens of Ukraine.

49,"12/ More on Dark Forest:
https://t.co/aq61YT2D5E"
50,"11/ After an internal skirmish, a ceasefire has been declared. The situation ended peacefully, and the Death Star is no more. 

https://t.co/ja4rN6UOtr"
51,"10/ @modukon1 was in control of the Death Star and was using it to obliterate opponents like an interstellar machine gun. When asked by to deactivate due to its grotesque powers, Modukon went rogue and declared war on @d_fdao.

https://t.co/3h2011E1Xi"
52,"9/ But it was too overpowered and players were unhappy.
https://t.co/SVKohSHeo0"
53,"8/ @darkforest_eth announced that this crazy stat-boosted planet-turned machine gun, while not ideal, was fair game. It would be infeasible to fix this issue without putting the integrity of the rest of the game at risk. 

https://t.co/2m0fq1RtUZ"
54,"7/ Obviously not everyone was happy.

https://t.co/FA5FGi89jW"
55,"6/ @gubsheep, one of the founders of @darkforest_eth, marveled at the strategic and creative use of @d_fdao's community.

https://t.co/7fo5OV4MMF"
56,"5/ In order to beat the elite solo players, a group of self-defined ""scrappy losers"" had to coordinate together to find a different way. 

https://t.co/fu2e66j9qz"
57,"4/ Then out of nowhere, @d_fdao jumped ahead.
https://t.co/kfhEo2oeR1"
58,"3/ As always, the elite @orden_gg was way ahead. https://t.co/xDhvhiMT51"
59,"2/ First, what is Dark Forest?

Dark Forest is a Web3 game where you conquer plants and build empires. Since you can interact directly with the smart contract, hacking becomes part of the game.

80,"2/ Bitcoin was a reaction to the financial crisis. To the Patriot Act. To the draconian drug laws.

We brought on a friend to discuss the philosophy of Bitcoin. We discuss his days as a professional poker player. And his experience with Silk Road.

81,"1/ I've seen 3 waves of crypto onboarding. Each wave bringing in a new cohort with a different set of values.
