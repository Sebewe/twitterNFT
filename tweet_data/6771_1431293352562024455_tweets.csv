36,"An interesting, well written take on #NFTs which mirrors a lot of my thoughts on the subject. It's complex, it has myriad viewpoints, it's not simply right or wrong.  It's art ideating via technology, it's technology ideating via art.  It's immature and it's far from perfect. https://t.co/4Az8cjjBo1"

47,"@eldrone @andrewpprice @BurhamJason An alternative take is that I used over 30 years of creative experience to create something I liked to enjoy the zeitgeist of the emerging NFT art market.  Other people enjoyed them too and bought them.

I've also made no secret that I used those funds to support other artists."

I see them as an entry ticket to an artist or project's future work or community.  There's a lot of money grabs, it's about supporting the good guys."

94,@andrewpprice It's an immature technology but an important one.  I have been exposed to more digital art and artists in one year than the previous ten.  Copyright theft is disgusting but as the technology matures it will hopefully be the solution.
