10,"@boredape93 @alekschichkanov try hard-refreshing, might be cached from a version of the app yesterday that had an issue with this new profile page header. Let me know if the problem persists."
11,@chrisdevlin7700 Try hard-refreshing and let me know if the problem persists. Probably cached from a version of the app yesterday that had issues with the profile page.

17,@DMyouFirst @Jayhawk850 @Gee__Gazza @opensea I'm not sure where this is going. Are you asking me to replace a CryptoPunk with an OpenSea logo?
18,"@Jayhawk850 @DMyouFirst @Gee__Gazza @opensea This argument kind of falls apart when you dig into statements I've previously made about how remixes add value to the original. The only 'gatekeeping' we do is not verifying them, as if they get DMCA'd there are issues that arise from users perceiving it as a trust indicator."

20,@Gfunkera86 @OG_Kenobi_Hello @DanielitoG25 @punkscomic Please submit a support ticket (link in bio) and we'll take a look.
21,@jeffalomaniac @Formerly5019 @AndrewTrackzy There are ways to better expose this in our UI rather than eliminating the functionality entirely.
22,"@AndrewTrackzy @Formerly5019 The process you're describing in your proposal is what is in place, basically. We regularly send out forms to capture this information from projects eligible for verification and have a team reviewing these submissions."
23,"@AndrewTrackzy You're still not understanding the crux of the issue, which is that if we're verifying projects before they reach any threshold of volume, that dramatically increases the number of projects we verify and decreases the time we can spend evaluating each project."
24,@Formerly5019 @AndrewTrackzy Welcome your thoughts on counter-proposals
25,"@AndrewTrackzy No, this is not a good idea. 

That threshold enables us to spend the necessary time evaluating projects that cross it. If we 'pre-verify' projects (on what basis?) there are too many for us to spend time reviewing details from each project to determine their authenticity."
26,"@jlindley9 @opensea @jessew_art @BushidoApes It's very easy for these reports to get missed on Twitter, this is not the recommended way to report fraudulent assets. We have an in-app reporting tool as well as a Trust &amp; Safety form (link in bio) from which these are addressed."
27,"@MadYakK @BradThe3rd @SpaceTarzan @Gee__Gazza @opensea He specifically suggested 'none of' the fees go back to the creators, which was the point of the comment that I was addressing. This is semantics."
28,"@BradThe3rd @SpaceTarzan @Gee__Gazza @opensea We changed our private sale fee structure, yes. This is a pretty uninteresting hot take if you're suggesting that we are not in control of our fee structure."
29,@banterlytics Because the user was specifically asking about whether artists receive fees from private sales.
30,"@BradThe3rd @SpaceTarzan @Gee__Gazza @opensea No, I was comparing the previous private sale creator fee structure to what currently exists. 2.5% fee remains."
31,"@SpaceTarzan @Gee__Gazza @opensea Actually, not true. Private sales used to have a 0% fee, they now include an artist royalty. 

Issues with royalties are being resolved but have nothing to do with 'greed' - just building scalable processes."
32,"@belikewater893 If we provide a service where a 10% fee is taken out as a creator royalty, inevitably services emerge that will offer a cheaper or free transfer that doesn't respect that creator monetization, since the royalties are not baked into the token itself."
33,@WickedBoneClub @opensea Wicked Hound Bone Club is now verified on OpenSea ☑️
34,@MadYakK @yatsnotyachts @Gee__Gazza @batzdu @opensea Hi - Have you spoken with @Matt_OpenSea?
35,"@CoinzyCapital Yep, you can cancel it from the item page"
36,"@ShrewdCharlie @boredapebot We will continue evaluating this fee structure, but there are other ways to be the source of truth for this space. Had we added artist royalties alone to private sales, the same criticism / 'flight risk' would be leveled at us."
37,"@Gee__Gazza @opensea You're welcome to your opinion there, and we'll continue evaluating this fee structure. However, I sense the same backlash and 'flight risk' would have occurred had we included artist royalties alone in private sales, and we're not interested in enabling users to circumvent those"
38,"@SpaceTarzan @Gee__Gazza @opensea Laughable to claim they are the 'greediest people in the space' despite launching OS in 2018 when there was not an NFT market, as compared to 2021 opportunists who got into this space when there was profit to be made. Popular products sometimes have to make divisive decisions."

54,@goku_nft @opensea @TieDyeNinjas They submitted the verification form ~24h ago. We have to review each one of these forms. I'm not interested in hearing your criticisms of our team. Let's stay focused on the issues at hand.
55,"@BAYCBoshi @opensea If you submit a support ticket on this, happy to capture more info there and resolve. Not sure if I'm fully understanding the problem (new listing at lower price can have privacy setting turned off so it is a public listing)"
56,"@BAYCBoshi @opensea 'Lowering the price' on OpenSea is sort of an abstraction - what you're really doing is creating a lower-priced listing (and higher-priced remains intact). It costs gas to completely cancel/replace a listing, so it often makes sense to just create a lower-priced listing."
57,"@BAYCBoshi @opensea Your public listings remain intact in the event of a counter-offer, though. There is a separate listing that is a private counter-offer to that person (which can be set to expire after a certain period of time). Can you describe how you would ideally like to use counter-offers?"

89,"@nftHyena There is some complexity here. If you did want the 'lower price' button to actually remove the higher-priced listing, that would require gas. Once the lower-priced listing sells, the higher-priced listing is invalidated, so it's often not necessary to cancel the higher one."
