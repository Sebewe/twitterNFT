2,"@goooner79 @TomCantonMedia @EsuzorManikel7 @sachabrady @Football_LDN It’s genuinely the same system then as it is now, as it was last season. Btw we were missing half our squad. Also, Tuchel, a coach, didn’t buy him… this has been ‘Chelsea’s’ long-term target since Conte. https://t.co/ejfl3dLdZZ"
3,"@sachabrady @Yehowabigunner @goooner79 @TomCantonMedia @EsuzorManikel7 @Football_LDN You’re quite right. Lukaku, like Auba, wasn’t the coaches choosing."
4,"@Yehowabigunner @goooner79 @TomCantonMedia @EsuzorManikel7 @sachabrady @Football_LDN A coach is job is to bring out the best in players, it’s actually down to trial and error. Havertz didn’t quite work out at the beginning but now he’s starting to shine - he’s quite clearly the better fit. Tuchel system &gt; Lukaku"
5,@goooner79 @TomCantonMedia @EsuzorManikel7 @sachabrady @Football_LDN Is it Tuchel’s fault Lukaku doesn’t fit his system?

61,"@tablecup1 @kabaka94 @Soca77194544 @naphtrax The irony continues.... 

You made a sarcastic play at Arsenal with your comment ""almost like Arteta parking the bus every time the opposition might try an attack is much easier to keep a clean sheet"" but now want to play victim? 

https://t.co/qHqYwGrLST"
62,@tablecup1 @kabaka94 @Soca77194544 @naphtrax I don't think I said one insult? I also provided stats to back things up...
63,"@tablecup1 @kabaka94 @Soca77194544 @naphtrax No genuinely, I'm finding it sad. Really sorry that you're offended by that. I honestly didn't meant to hurt you. 

And to answer your question it's where the ball is."

65,"@tablecup1 @kabaka94 @Soca77194544 @naphtrax It's really sad that you're not getting this. Overall (Home/Away) 'Action Zones' mean a % in where the ball was during this season. You notice how Brentford below have a higher % in their own third in comparison to City? Look at City's opposition %

You’ve neither watched Real or France to even bother noticing his decline."

68,@kabaka94 @tablecup1 @Soca77194544 @naphtrax He’s genuinely confused and thinks structure = defensive. United fans are starving for stability 😂

We’re also second behind only City for hitting the woodwork this season. https://t.co/7vV75waL9E"
70,@tablecup1 @kabaka94 @Soca77194544 @naphtrax Varane hasn’t been good for Real Madrid or France for two seasons and he’s been arse for United. One player is on the decline and the other is heading straight to the top.
