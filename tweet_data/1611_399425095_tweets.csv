47,@Janks_NFT @liquiddensity @grelysian @WGMInterfaces @nifty_io I appreciate the feedback. Please understand this was not done with ill-intent. My goal was to see the project to fruition. As mentioned previously. I have removed any mention of the project and will not be pursuing. My goal was to help the current team and not to do any harm.
