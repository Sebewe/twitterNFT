46,@0xAAinsley we can’t wait to have you !weee
47,@Heatahhh literally thinking the same thing
48,"All this leads up to my final point 
👇

Invest in the people + the team."
49,"Ex @coolcatsnft 
Founders @cloncast @xtremetom @Lynqoid @evanluza (creatives + developers) decided to hire a CEO to hep bring their vision to life 

Being able to step out, see whats needed to scale &amp; be humble enough to hire into that, is a strength I value &amp; happily bet on."
50,"Are they able to

👉Identify what roles are needed and be willing to spend dollars for their salaries
👉Hire enough headcount to move quickly. 

is the game they're making going to take 1 year or are they willing to hire more talent to push it out in 6 months?"
51,"3. Team Expansion

To launch a project, you may need a developer/artist, but it doesn’t mean you have the skillset to turn it into a business, execute the roadmap/build a brand for the masses.

If they don’t, are they willing to invest in the talent to do so?"
52,"Ex: @psychedelic_nft  
@BAYC2745 IRL built a brand + marketing agency (working w/ IKEA,Sony,Mcdonalds)

One of the most incredibly powerful entries into the NFT space to date leveraging his IRL marketing exp

53,"🧁 Brownie points if they have a proven success record meaning you can have confidence in their

👉ability and know-how to execute
👉ability to integrate web2 experience into web3"
54,"2. Team Experience

Understand what the teams experience is whether thats through linkedin/socials or simply just ask the question. 

Then decide whether their skillset lends itself to the execution of their promised roadmap and plans they’ve shared."
55,"1. Undoxxed Team

In a world where being anon and using a cartoon pfp is celebrated, founders who are doxxed lends its legitimacy and confidence, and I would argue, a must-have for project founders who are pulling in huge sums of money."
