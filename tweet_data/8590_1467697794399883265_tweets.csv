True Names Limited is hiring a General Manager to help us build the best tool…"
1,@mynameisdimaz You can set your records using the current version of the manager at https://t.co/j0xREBNiSn. You can start using the redesign in read-only mode at https://t.co/G9mcwvVfbb — more functionality coming soon!
2,"Have you set your ENS name’s records, anon? https://t.co/LSCMEH1ZlU"
3,"Please reply or message with feedback, bugs, and so on! https://t.co/uV49iGNWFX"
4,Legendary work by @taytemss 🤝
5,We are building out the new manager in the open! Take the latest build for a spin at https://t.co/G9mcwvVfbb 🛹 https://t.co/CKluNkcq9J
6,"@chrismessina @signinwitheth This is just an idea, and is not yet finalized. We welcome your feedback!"
7,@AskSnehasish Lots of thought has gone into this! Here is an alternative we were considering… https://t.co/MEEAed7HFZ
8,@GlehenEth @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan This is just an example from a mockup! Please disregard the values shown.
9,"@0xWew @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Good point! And registration fees for names have always been dollar denominated, but we are now showing a gas fee estimate in USD as well."
10,What would it look like if you could extend registration for multiple @ensdomains names in just a couple taps? https://t.co/xeTV3fN7M6
11,@endofliquidity @ensdomains Coming soon! https://t.co/nPUIJCAxgK
12,"Try using the new interface for @ethleaderboard, and let us know how it goes! Lovely work by @gregskril and @taytemss 💫 https://t.co/tTK9F7x08Y"
13,@ogphysikal @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Yes! This is what the Notifications icon in the header hints at 😙
14,@antcab84 @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Not yet; coming soon!
15,@TedCChu @dbzdoteth @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Great point – it could be at both the top &amp; bottom for convenience!
16,@BrantlyMillegan @OldObiBenKenobi @khalidhamdi @ensdomains I think this would be possible to build on top of @ourZORA!
17,"@KJJKETH @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains Ah, got it. We will tweak the background &amp; shadow filters behind the text to help improve contrast for light avatar images! cc @tanrikuIu"
18,"@KJJKETH @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains Yes, we will look through all the screens carefully for color contrast issues before it goes live! We are overlooking some important details when sharing these designs early, which will be addressed before it goes live."
19,@garypalmerjr @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Yes! See discussion here: https://t.co/pfcy6kFlrz
20,@vvooter @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan cc’ing @_jefflau and @talbert_leon who might know more about any performance limitations here :-)
21,"@khalidhamdi @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan We do not want to focus on marketplace functionality with this iteration of the redesign. We hope other teams are focused on building the best buy &amp; sell experience for NFTs, including @ensdomains names!"
22,"@JoseLionelVelez @tennnistennis @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan @gnosisSafe Will defer to @validatoreth @_jefflau here — is our app compatible with Gnosis Safe, and if not, is this possible?"
23,"@dbzdoteth @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Here is the Details view for a name, while it is being filled out with information! https://t.co/Qaa2opcymd"
24,"@aoxborrow @0xWew @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Yes, this would be the perfect blend!"
25,@KJJKETH @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Thank *you* for the kind words!
26,@Brommhill @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Great feedback – will take this into consideration! cc'ing @BrantlyMillegan
27,"@KJJKETH @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Yes, of course! Will consider making adding / editing subdomains accessible from the top level (e.g. in this contextual menu shown)."
28,"@tennnistennis @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan We're thinking this will be the homepage, https://t.co/hdmlOCdqgL, if you hold names in the wallet you connect with."
29,"@0xWew @ensdomains @BrantlyMillegan Great question, we're considering adding a list view as well! We wanted to highlight the avatar-record-as-NFT-background feature, especially as it may help people quickly identify their name, but recognize it might not be as efficient as a list."
30,A sneak peek into a dashboard for managing your @ensdomains names ✨ https://t.co/WBh5I6c65j
31,"@clthorbe @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains Yes, it could be left aligned with the target here and keep the tagline in full view, good point!"
32,"@jakemoxey @markdalgleish Such an intuitive design, big { props } to you both!"
33,"@NicLazTweets Yes, it will remain accessible from both interfaces!"
34,"@SobaLoggy Great suggestion, thank you! 🧠"
35,"Have feedback, or want to contribute to the design &amp; development of the new manager? DMs open!"
36,Late night alpha leak 🌖 https://t.co/lPcT9cFnI6
37,RT @rainbowdotme: probably nothing? https://t.co/txCBOSimco
38,"@aoxborrow @enstools @ensdomains Killer work, thanks for building this!"
