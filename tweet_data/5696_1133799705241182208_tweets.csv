1,"@yossariian Interesting concept you have. I like the Utility aspect of getting more of your work in the future.

I’m going to keep an eye on it."
2,"These are just some of my initial thoughts as I minted and purchased my first NFTs.

#NFT #nftart #NFTMinting #blockchain #BillionaireNFTs #Ethereum 

Would be great to spread the word about this emerging industry for newcomers. Here is the original tweet to retweet and comment. https://t.co/cAFxO4TaLL"
3,"It is on the internet where thousands, even millions of people can look at your work and decide if they want it.

I believe this is an excellent opportunity for creators.

👇"
4,"Next, is if you are a creator. Yes, creator, not just an “artist”. T the NFT space can provide you with an income for doing what you love.

It is a quick way to get your work to a wide audience, and quickly.

No need to rent an art studio or try and get in a gallery.

👇"
5,"He also is an owner in the FlyFish NFT which is a membership to a soon to open restaurant in NYC.

(Yes, I plan on buying one when the right opportunity presents itself.)

So these are Utility NFTs. And can do more than just give you the pleasure of a picture.

👇"
6,"But 2 things to think about.

@garyvee has a great Utility to his NFTs that can have a benefit in the real world. His @veefriends  allows people to get airdrops and is a ticket to his upcoming VeeCon.

👇"
7,"I can’t say yet. Artwork NFTs does feel a little like the Beanie Baby craze a while back. 

But that doesn’t mean it is a bad thing.

If you got in early and sold early back then, you made a profit. 

👇"
8,"Just like investing in the public markets, it’s ok to pass on something. 

I personally will be going deeper into this NFT space.

Will it be here for the long run?

👇"
9,"Don’t jump in head first and buy a $100k NFT. There will be opportunities, you just have to look for them

Start small. You will make mistakes, and it will cost you real money.

Understand there are a lot of smart people that will try to scam you. Be on the lookout.

👇"
10,"I’m the end, spent way more in gas fees than I expected, but it’s a learning curve.

Easy to laugh at people and say this is stupid, but it’s an experience.

If you are looking to get into this space, start small.

👇"
11,"If the project sold out and you still minted and accepted the price in your wallet, you still paid the gas fee.

Got hit for that… twice!

From my understanding, that happens because you still have to pay the “toll” of the blockchain “recording” your transaction. 

👇"
12,"First, with $ETH, gas fees can be absolutely crazy. Especially when the blockchain becomes very active. 

Transaction went from ~$125 to over $400 in a few minutes. 

I am sure that is in part because there were multiple popular projects minting at the same time.

👇"
13,"Couple things on what I learned minting and buying my first NFT…

Thread.

🧵👇"
14,"Both #minted and bought my first #NFT today!

Thanks @billionairebnkr for the crazy experience and welcoming me to the club.

21,"Would love to hear a baseline of how much one should have to be in the #NFT space.

Seems like 5 $ETH is a good minimum to start. 

Thoughts?

#ETH #NFTGame #NFT #BAYC #CryptoPunk #Crypto #cryptocurrecy #blockchain #DAO"
22,"Who are some good people to follow in the #NFTCommunity as well as #Ethereum. 

(Not traders, but people who tweet good information as I get more into this space.)

23,".@themoviecoin This looks very interesting. 

I like the concept.

24,"Actively looking on #opensea for #NFT at reasonable price. 

Any #NewNFT designers that have something at a reasonable price I might enjoy?

Would be cool to buy my first piece from someone who is just getting into this space too.

#FirstNFT #newNFTs #newnftartist #newnftproject"
25,"Searching #NFT and $ETH, all you get are a million accounts trying to “give away” #crypto and #NFT projects if like/follow/retweet.

Any good accounts/projects I should follow as I venture into this space?"
26,"I’ve read up a little, but thought I would tweet about my journey and venture into this new world.

I participated in a DAO recently. The structure of that is what is getting me involved.

#Ethereum #NFT #Metaverse $ETH #NFTCommumity #blockchain #cryptocurrency #crypto #DAO"
27,So I’ve been picking up $ETH recently. I’ve decided to jump into the world of #crypto and #NFTs.

33,"@the_wildwoman @ROGUEWEALTH This is absolutely on point. I was recently in the market for a new CRM, and one of the benefits they said it offered was integration and automation through APIs. I completely ignored it because I didn't even know what it was. 

I have now spent a week learning about them."

36,"@think_katierass I'm surprised nobody is talking about the TIAA proprietary real estate contracts that TIAA put *every one* of their clients in. 

The ones that take 9-10 years to fully liquidate. 

How they claim it is suitable for a non-accredited investor, or even retires, is beyond me."
37,@UniverCurious This is an excellent image!
38,@FiSurgi Scream it from the rooftops to everyone!
39,"A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). 

Pronounced like ""smack"" - but ""SPAC"".

These are relatively new but have blown up recently in their offerings. They are IPO ""companies"" that are like a blank check to raise funds to finance a merger or acquisition."
40,"I have stopped tweeting for a while, but I have not gotten off twitter.
