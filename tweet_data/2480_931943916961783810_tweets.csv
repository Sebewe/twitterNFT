12,I'm on the same wave. I was looking more into the downtown Baltimore area. A few folks are selling properties with tenants still having 12+ months on the lease remaining. “Guaranteed” cash flow! https://t.co/se7l2HksU1

19,"Getting the debit card from @cryptocom  was probably one the best crypto decisions I ever made. With the current price of $CRO, I received an additional $7500+ than I would've Received if I just have used my “traditional” debit card!

22,I didn't need a mystical ball for that one 🎯 $LUNA https://t.co/cZreF2VbYH
23,@HunterWatt10 Sure I’m not saying that a person shouldn’t buy LUNA. I’m just saying that they should take caution in dumping $11000 in the Project at once. Maybe make multiple trades over time to ensure they have the best position.
24,"I’m not saying you shouldn’t buy $LUNA; the asset is one of my most significant holdings. I’m saying you should carefully plan each of your entries and exit’s because no one can see the future, or else everyone would’ve gone all in at $5!"
25,"With that being said, think about how many people saw the same thing and are waiting for the right moment to take profits?"
26,"There’s a lot of people who are going to wake up this morning and think that they should buy $LUNA. I’m going to be the first to tell you.

DO NOT FOMO IN!!! 

The $LUNA charts looked fucking fantastic yesterday, and the parabolic movement was pretty easy to recognize."

IMO, of course."

63,It means finding (creating) our place within society.
64,Living doesn’t always just mean fighting off threats from outside forces such as animals trying eat us alive or other humans out looking kill us (or both).
65,"Because of how routine everything has become over time, wanting something bigger gives us a new perspective on the situation, which may help turn things around if done correctly!"
66,"It is a common human impulse to want nothing more than simply survive in this world, but that isn't what life was made for. Getting by day after exhausting day can be tiring and lonely—and sometimes people even end up feeling like their lives are without meaning or purpose."
