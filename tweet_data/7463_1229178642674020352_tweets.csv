1,@craigallenbrill @lavote You can’t get signatures instead? 26k is insane.
2,@AndrewYang He barely touched on the struggles we’ve faced these last two years. He brushed over the fact that COVID is done. He announced another war. We can’t let him or anyone else slide. Not now. Not ever. Forward Party should take a stand against this admin as much as the last.

13,@JerryJDeitz Indeed.
14,@VaderEats Best new show in a while.
15,@VaderEats I’m on one still!
16,Okay I’m done. I can’t handle it anymore. FJB.
17,@VaderEats I’m watching Why Women Kill. This is one reason.
18,Did Fauci just get a standing ovation? 🤡
19,“Grow the economy. Lower the cost of families” y’all out here buying whole families? 👀
20,Did he say 50% tax rate for corporations? How are we going to buy American again?
21,It’s not a good thing if women left their kids with strangers to go to work. Moms don’t want to generate “economic growth” they want to take care of their kids. Your priorities are not ours.
22,Stop giving us tax credits. We don’t want to pay taxes period.
23,@BrianEskow No 😂 It’s not cheaper until the government pays for it. I think that’s what he means. We’ll subsidize them.
24,Now he’s talking about insulin costs but he doesn’t support universal healthcare so wtf?
25,His solution to inflation? Make cars in America. You can’t make this shit up.
26,Our economy is great! But so many are struggling bc of inflation. Which one is it???
27,Ford is investing in electric bc they are about to get stomped by Tesla.
28,@MurhpysInLaw Yes.
29,@daylon_eth Yes. He said we were separated bc of COVID but now we are together... and no one is masked.
30,@Tony240sx1 Yep. It was delayed for four years bc it was supposed to be Hillary.
31,Buy American? It's impossible to not buy from China now because of what you and your friends did.
32,@Tony240sx1 The real reason why we got out of Afghanistan. Free up the troops.
33,@MurhpysInLaw Right lmao. My thought exactly 💯
34,@JimFKing1 @Nicola_Telsa Only if we let it. He's sending us to war for NATO.
35,You gave us $1400 bro. Stop bragging that you did anything to help during COVID.
36,"""the pandemic punished all of us"" yeah because of your shitty policies."
37,RT @HeidiBriones: How the hell is this the state of our union? All I hear is Russia.
38,Suddenly Biden sounds like he has energy. Warmongers really get excited about sending people to die so they can profit.

47,"@shawna_burley @CDPHE Water, vitamins, sleep. Monitor fever. Same as any flu."
48,@SaucySaidIt It’s sick. It’s also ruined friendships and broken apart families.
49,@SaucySaidIt You’re telling me. The worst part is everyone acts like they like it.
50,@shawna_burley and masks don’t work.
51,@SaucySaidIt I haven’t been out in the last year without either having to show it or leaving because I didn’t want to show it. The funny thing is that they barely look at it. You could photoshop it.
52,@SaucySaidIt We still have to wear masks everywhere and most places require vaccine cards.
53,There’s no way Oregon would end the mask mandate if masks did a damn thing. Unless the pandemic is over. You have to concede at least one of those points or you’re illogical.
