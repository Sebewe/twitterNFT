21,"@justinkan I think ultimately the best way to address gamer skepticism around NFTs / web3 is just to ship great web3 games that innovate and are positive for players

There just aren’t enough good live web3 games that people can play today. So let’s build! 💪"

40,"3/ @SkyMavisHQ will be launching builder programs in the coming months. Incredibly excited to see a new generation of games and dapps built on Ronin

More thoughts from my partner @AriannaSimpson  👇
https://t.co/O8yatxperp"
41,"2/ Many of our top game platforms started off as single games that then commercialized their infrastructure:

Half-Life -&gt; @Steam 
Warcraft -&gt; Battle net
@FortniteGame -&gt; Epic Store / @UnrealEngine
&amp; now @AxieInfinity -&gt; @Ronin_Network 🔥"
42,"1/ Incredibly stoked about the launch of @Ronin_Network $RON today! 🚀

For game developers exploring web3, there are few chains more battle-tested: 4M wallets, ~500k DAU, and massive liquidity (15% of all 2021 NFT volume)

Ronin solves distribution &amp; scale for new games 👇 https://t.co/G77C2VDo8k"

46,@pixiekate13 @nigeleccles agree on the allergic reactions to pay-to-win and also the vocal minority
47,"@anirnair @RohithT historically a lot of the pushback came from the view that F2P changed the design of games to be overly focused on monetizing users (ads, popups, events, etc), vs in a traditional premium game you paid $50 upfront and could then just enjoy the game forever"
48,"Excited to share that @a16z is investing in @BreederDAO - an innovative DAO that lowers barriers to entry for web3 games by programmatically breeding and crafting in-game assets ⚒️

Thoughtful tweetstorm from my partner @WuCarra 👇 https://t.co/HhPgDAL2vn"
49,@tandavas @nigeleccles 🙏
50,@Fwiz @YouTube @0xPolygon congrats @Fwiz! you're going to crush it and so excited to see you lead the charge 🔥
51,@RohithT Yeah that’s a good point - there are lots of folks who haven’t fully accepted F2P yet and NFTs must seem like the next incarnation
52,@andreas I think part of the challenge is that if you’re a newbie you probably want to try a game that’s well known like @AxieInfinity or @ThetanArena for the first time and those tend to be more expensive via secondary markets
53,@inque54 Thank you builder! 🙏
54,@henriqueoelze @themlpx We need more!
55,@kurlancheek Yeah it’s unfortunate
56,"@dfiden Fair point, agree on accepting games &gt; tech"
57,@perelmanor Thank you builder! 🙏🚀
58,@kookoocryptotv Thank you builder! 🙏
59,"@themlpx totally. we need more web3-specific innovation - new gameplay mechanics, new genres, etc"
60,"@kurlancheek yep, i think this is just what happens when the debate is centered on reddit/twitter as opposed to grounded in live products people can play"
61,"@nigeleccles Yep I actually talk about that in this thread below - tldr is that the skins don't affect your ability to win (it's a tokenized ""input"" instead of a finished good)

https://t.co/B5qbyioC03"
62,@econosopher nice tom brady analogy =)
63,"5/ this is all stuff that builders today are already working on

the first player-focused F2P web3 game that reaches 100M users will be the thing that convinces people web3 games can be positive. not winning reddit debates or twitter beefs. so let's build! 🚀"
64,"4/ i really think the only long-term solution is to keep building 🧱

ship great games that are fun, have innovative on-chain mechanics, and enable player ownership and trading in a non-predatory way. also lower barriers to entry and make NFTs affordable, etc"
65,"3/ most importantly, there just aren't enough good web3 games live yet that players can experience firsthand to see what all the fuss is about. so most information comes secondhand or through polarizing channels like reddit or twitter"
66,"2/ a few things:
- NFTs are expensive and still not affordable by the average gamer who saves up and buys one $20-40 game every 3 months
- there are scams and the high $ amounts hurt (vs getting ""scammed"" in a mobile game just meant wasting $0.99 on a good you didn't use)"
67,"1/ it feels like the cultural war against NFTs in games is escalating

i used to think it was similar to the free-to-play backlash a decade ago, but it's worse today and some key differences are likely exacerbating it 👇"
68,@KatiaAmeri Need to do that next!

75,"4/ Long-term, Carry1st aspires to build the Garena of Africa - combining games, financial services, ecommerce, social, and web3 on/offramps in a convenient super app 🔥"
76,"3/ @Carry1st was founded by Cordel Robbin-Coker, Lucy Hoffman, and Tino M to address these challenges. They've aggregated Africa's disparate payment networks into a modern fintech platform serving over 1M players"
77,"2/ Payments is also a major barrier to game developers today - the African landscape is highly fragmented across 270+ wallets, 500+ banks, and multiple card networks in 55 countries 💳"
78,"1/ @Carry1st represents @a16z's first investment into an African-headquartered company!

We see a huge opportunity for a next-gen games platform and social network in Africa. Few games today target Africa and even fewer design or localize for the continent 🌍"
79,"Thrilled to share that @dhaber and I are leading the next round in @Carry1st - Africa's leading next-gen game platform building at the intersection of games, fintech, and web3. More 👇

- Acquire for IP (MSFT x @bethesda)
- Acquire for team (Tencent x @riotgames)
- Acquire for capabilities (TTWO x @zynga, FB x @oculus)

Mega-acquisitions like Atvi fall into multiple buckets: IP (Blizzard, COD) + capabilities (mobile)"
84,"2 record-breaking games M&amp;A deals in just the first month of this year! 🔥

88,@amytongwu @FTX_Official @SBF_FTX Congrats Amy!!! Big moves and FTX is lucky to have you! 🔥
89,@CryptoRam7 @discord @higinDAO agreed!
90,"Great retro on the early days of @discord. Similarly, I like to see start-ups focus on a narrow group of core users early on (ex. FF14 guilds for Discord). Be the best product solving those users' pain points

Once the flywheel gets going, can expand out but early on focus is 👑 https://t.co/4J6dHIRQaJ"
91,@WuCarra Lfg!
92,"Very much agree with @nikitabier. I tweeted last year on how the best product design = game design. Many shared principles between how the top modern games and consumer apps attract, engage, &amp; retain users

https://t.co/OW72OmeEzc"
93,"Great thread 👇 on building consumer apps. My favorite parts:
- don't be afraid to have a narrow target audience (don't build for ""everyone"")
- people download apps to solve core human needs (intrinsic motivation in game design)
- products shouldn't depend on partnerships to work https://t.co/6FFw15gnbP"
94,"Take-two + @zynga to join forces in one of the biggest M&amp;A deals in games history 💪
