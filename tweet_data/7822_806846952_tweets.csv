59,Most NFT teams will fade away in months for sure as they have earned enough money with a real small team and have no clue what to do next. Invest in those who have a clear roadmap and keep delivering what they have promised. @CBCreepz

73,I said don't look at the price of $loomi. $loomi you produced by your staked army is only for free-entering the rest of the story. It should have better tokenomics when we have the Creepz universe platform. But not for now. 1 $loomi =1 $loomi and Creepz flip Apes https://t.co/UiE41n9aLb

75,"I usually don’t get involved when a crypto project just hit 100x last week, because it usually means it will bore the brunt of the selling. But for Creepz, the floor price below 10E is just insane."
