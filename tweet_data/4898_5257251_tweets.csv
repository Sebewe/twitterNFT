1,"Thank you for contributing your time and creativity.

@kiiarens @zoewintersx @sabet @sarah_script @miriampaints @killercollectiv @ArmandSarlangue @RosadlosReyesSG @DmitriyKhaykin @hypemansionclub @pax_art @K_GRUNERT @theGANSmachine @knftworld @ErinAsmussen @maxximillian"
2,"Doing our small part to help support the cause in Ukraine. Buying a single NFT goes a long way. Thankful that so many artists contributed their artwork and their voices for peace. Campaign runs all of March, so additional artists can still join. https://t.co/4N8jn0l54i"
3,Our first listing was on https://t.co/RfxhW7z5Ik. Great to come full circle to bring $OGN to US Binance customers. Tweet at @BinanceUS to get $OUSD listed next! https://t.co/5bmtg4RfNW
4,"RT @JustinCBram: In direct competition with Terra’s $UST, Ruble single sided staking yield now matching anchor’s 20% APY. 

https://t.co/bg…"
5,"Congratulations to Ed and the @hack_vc team. They were one of the earliest @OriginProtocol investors, and they will kill it with their new $200M Crypto Seed Fund. @TechCrunch coverage: https://t.co/VX1wc0GeMn"
6,@chayqeubay @OriginProtocol Great will DM
7,@NFTAlphaBeta Looks like a rug growing in grass
8,@TheAvgJoeCrypto @theGANSmachine @OriginProtocol Wow that's really cool. @theGANSmachine let's connect via DM.
9,Who else thinks @telegram stickers should all become NFTs? I'm too addicted to random Pepes dancing around or making funny faces. Would pay ETH to own. https://t.co/bxOPwrtXdj
10,"Similar to what we did with @StJude @inspiration4x @DrSianProctor @subtractive last fall.

https://t.co/z8lFJGnSFg"
11,"Any NFT creators interested in linking up to do a 100% for charity drop for Ukraine relief? @OriginProtocol will waive all proceeds and market heavily.

Reply or DM."
12,"Probably shouldn't comment about the market nuking when people are getting bombed IRL, but just wanted to quickly mention that after major crisis events like 9/11, markets have usually rallied after an initial bloodletting. Strangely, uncertainty is worse than war and terrorism."
13,"I hope Xi doesn't take this opportunity to invade Taiwan. That would be additionally gut-wrenching. 

We need aliens to show up at the outer edge of the solar system for humanity to unite against a common foe."
14,What is the best way to short Putin? Some crypto native smart contract genius can figure this out right? Congrats on cementing your legacy as a madman. Wonder how Stalin and Hitler feel about how the world remembers them.
15,"RT @VitalikButerin: Reminder: Ethereum is neutral, but I am not."
16,My heart goes out to the Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. May the US and rest of the West show some damn conviction.
17,@Barthazian Trade you the ETH you lost as cost basis for all those worthless NFTs today?
18,@Kakuberry Where's my free NFT homey? LOL.
19,"TLDR token unlocks are highly bearish (increased supply and investors wanting to bank profits). We've experienced this first hand over and over again at @OriginProtocol. Thankfully, we finished the last $OGN investor unlock a few weeks ago. Ready for next bull cycle. https://t.co/09l8nXTIiX"
20,@0x_b1 @BoredApeYC @BoredAxelApe @FODLfi @mutant_cartel @officialboredAi LSD ape @BoredApeYC 🤯
21,@arcadedotinc 🤯
22,@AktoucheRacim95 DM @OriginProtocol. We will send you the free NFT.
23,@ericosiu Nothing. NFTs are a scam. 🤪🤪🤪
24,@Kakuberry Tell him about your ape that can pay for a luxury car now. 🦍 🦧
25,@seedphrase The madness is about to come back too. 😈
26,@farokh Maybe if your QB is @farokh. Sadly not if it’s Jimmy G.
27,@jamiequint It’s why I left
28,@jayyeh It should be in your free time AND you feel pressure (lots of it) hahah.
29,@JoeButtram @lightcrypto Someone is back on CT. 🤔
30,On the one hand crypto is unforgiving with insane drawdowns and volatility that can make even veterans feel queasy. On the other there are almost limitless bullets to fire in the next 5-10 years in the greatest wealth creation event mankind has ever seen.
31,"@mrjasonchoi Hate voice messages. So hard for recipient to follow along, especially if multitasking. If async should just be text haha."
32,First time that an Origin-powered drop went down ever. 😢. Such is the power of @ParisHilton in driving demand for NFTs. The amount of site load we saw was extreme. Glad we got it back up and running fast though. https://t.co/Ck6nv1PnPq
33,Gn. A solid 7-day work week. Until gm.
34,RT @paulg: NFTs can be used for so many different things that you're inviting history to make a fool of you if you dismiss them. Even if I…
35,"RT @EveryVowel: ""@ParisHilton is doing so much for the NFT community, empowering everyone in the space. I'm honored to be part of this jour…"
36,"When people tell me to diversify out of crypto into real estate and stocks, I tell them that diversification is for the weak. Then I tell them about stablecoins and yield generation against non-volatile (mostly safe) assets. Still early."
37,"RT @zhusu: Bankers too exhausted to cover crypto

News outlets too lazy to hire cryptonatives

Institutions still buying equity over coins…"
38,Cultivating your tribe/community is just as important as learning your craft. https://t.co/qj40JNwgkq
39,McDonald’s sees record shortage of staff. 🍟 https://t.co/SnII5qkbj2
40,"Join @crypto888crypto @ParisHilton and myself to learn more about the 888 Inner Circle and @OriginProtocol and Paris’s collaborations with the 888 community. 

 https://t.co/oHPSO7Tptl"
41,Evangelizing the NFT movement https://t.co/ZM4rmNJ4RN
42,"It's been amazing to work with @ParisHilton and her team on 'Past Lives, New Beginnings.' Paris designed a $11.11 NFT for all of her fans just getting into NFTs. Hundreds of bonus prizes including chances to meet Paris in the Metaverse and IRL.

https://t.co/cMm7XQtbZT https://t.co/eg6UKx58rX"
43,RT @florianpicasso: To the 🌙 🚀 @niftygateway @OriginProtocol https://t.co/gjDMaYbIJ0 https://t.co/ZDyDvYWWyx
44,Did I mention that you can use it for free if you are an $OGN stakeholder? Look out for a couple sweet drops coming shortly. https://t.co/PbaD5VLgsD
45,"Anyone can now use @OriginProtocol Story to launch their own NFT sales. Same tech that top NFT artists and celebs are using. Now that the foundation is finally set with public launch today, we’re going to build a ton of new features. LFG. 

https://t.co/yLSfqdGhrJ"
46,Well put. One of the advantages of non-bull markets is the signal can be separated from the noise. https://t.co/rghTis6o0F
47,Ease of leverage in crypto through perp trading and DeFi loans means the lows are violent but the short squeezes are beautiful. Hoping the brilliant @Rewkang is right with this call. https://t.co/uLycdfUwnn
48,"I was wrong. @parishlton is Queen of the Metaverse (and not just NFTs) according to @nightline. Thanks for the first on air demo of our Story NFT platform and the shoutout to @OriginProtocol and what we're doing @abcnews. $OGN to the masses.

https://t.co/mtDgwMxT1S"
49,Who thinks @justinbieber should buy one of my floor mutants for 100 ETH next? 🤡🤡🤡 https://t.co/pH7eomIimL
50,"Yesterday I thought my $1.5k jacket was stolen, and I was furious. Yet I have fewer complaints about getting rugged in DeFi or dropping a few ETH on an NFT mint knowing it might go south. Mental accounting diff between fiat and crypto is weird. Price everything in ETH you all."
51,@sobylife Been doing that my whole adult life. I’m the first test user. Dammit.
52,"In light of today's crazy bumps with $MIM and $UST, yield farmers should consider $OUSD. Fully backed by $USDT, $USDC, and $DAI. Not risk-less, but way less susceptible to systemic shock than newer algo or fractional reserve stables. https://t.co/9wMuBHawy5"
53,@trevorjonesart Ser you are too successful for the system to handle your giant cheque sizes.
54,RT @davidbianchi: @ParisHilton really pushing the boundaries and making this very real on masse! Amazing work for my brother and OP team!!…
55,"The queen of NFTs @ParisHilton is giving away free NFTs to everyone that attended @jimmyfallon tonight. Tease of what we're working with her and @superplastic  on at @originprotocol and a @BoredApeYC reveal on top. 
https://t.co/RWHYCzLOQW"
56,@seedphrase @farokh Looking for roommates for my new 3-section cardboard box. Double corrugated. Want in?
57,RT @jackbutcher: I am once again asking you to zoom out https://t.co/zjL8KG2wL7
58,"@farokh Stabilizing ETH at these (or slightly lower) prices will help. Allows more holders to get in at this level and create a new base for moving up into the future. However, LOW LOW ETH will make many newcomers lose faith (e.g. 2018). The truth is somewhere in the middle."
59,@joshfraser @David4Luke https://t.co/HzVMC2agEc
60,"Gratitude above all else. 5 years ago we would have been ecstatic to play our idealistic, counter-culture, degen games at these levels. Do not lose that appreciation because you have habituated to our previous new normal. The best is yet to come even as we stare into the abyss."
61,"In times of max fear and pain, it is important to telescope out. On a multi-year time horizon #wagmi. Keep BUIDLing the web3 future we want frens. Short-term volatility becomes a blip as our industry continues to grow and begins to mature."
62,@theseansneed @gama_nft Wow that’s awesome
63,Crunchtime. Sprint sprint sprint. Working all this weekend and next but super amped about it. Crypto never sleeps. #cryptolife
64,Let's go @kevinlin @adambao22. Glad to be an investor. More NFT + gaming will drive our entire industry forward in a huge way. https://t.co/SJJsScVegl https://t.co/pMnDKY94xS
65,"Thanks to @business @BloombergTV for giving me my 15 seconds of fame to talk about web3. 11:50. Feel blessed to be included in this TV airing that also features some of the earliest pioneers in the blockchain/crypto ecosystem.

https://t.co/rm6YAQvIUC"
66,"🦍 strong together. @crypto888crypto, holder of the #1 rarest @BoredApeYC ape, is breaking new ground with @OriginProtocol and other great partners.  Now let's expand the number of NFT apes and build more community across our 8 circles and even more. https://t.co/fpKwTChQyg"
67,"Triple digit APYs on stablecoin farming using $OUSD and @ArchimedesFi coming in the next few months. Here's how.

https://t.co/JxkFAs9TDo

Excited for more DeFi protocols to build on top of @OriginProtocol technology."
68,Solution is to have a long time horizon and a diversified basket of high-quality cryptos. Then a lot of the “scams” play out as generationally important protocols that create the largest wealth generation event in the history of humanity. 💎 🙌 https://t.co/152XTeteMk
69,"Admittedly, this was a great experience. Web3 'Connect Wallet' will be the 2025 Xmas winner. Self-custody of funds and universal acceptance of stablecoins by merchants incoming. LFG. https://t.co/X4KSAKTzRl"

71,@crypto888crypto Money amplifies peoples' true personalities. The good become better and are grateful. The assholes become more painful to deal with.
72,@AriDavidPaul Thanks. Always appreciate your insights.
73,@AriDavidPaul Why now vs any other time
74,@jayyeh Not great at both. Need to get better. Please help me say no.
75,@burg_fisher I haven't sold any OGN and the company has bought OGN back on multiple occasions.
76,"Got a few of these gifted to me by the @lum_xyz team.  Reply to this thread, shoot them a follow, &amp; join their Discord https://t.co/oDGoyXNE2O and I'll give away a few of the passes to people on this thread. https://t.co/nG9gx8wH4v"
77,@0xSamHarrison 2x a week but who's counting.
78,Crypto is not a zero sum game. Global penetration ~0.5%. A rising tide raises all ships (even if it also brings turbulence). We can win together by growing the pie. #wagmi https://t.co/KTb2kyYC02
79,@mrjasonchoi Guilty as charged
80,"RT @balajis: People forget just how completely non-obvious the entire digital revolution was every step of the way.

81,"It’s easy to fall back to bad paradigms because they made you successful in the past.

Note to self: assume past performance is not indicative of future success, especially in the 24/7 frenetic constantly changing world of crypto. 

What early web3 practices need to be evolved? https://t.co/mssEtkGH5Z"
82,"What's the coolest utility unlock that you've recently seen for an NFT (not counting WL, Discord access, and all the cookie cutter stuff)?"
83,@StaniKulechov @0xFrame Favorite features?
84,@ArsalaanHairaan @OriginProtocol @joshfraser Happy to have you use the platform and give us feedback if you think it'll make us launch faster.
85,@hunterwalk Happy new year Hunter. Want to get on a zoom? :)
86,@farokh No doubt but more handsome
87,@jayyeh More GM and hello fren will take you far. 🤡
88,"Web3 founders, what are you using for your ATS? Applicant tracking system? Looking to hire several key roles at @OriginProtocol."
89,@Rewkang @nftgerry OMG this is ridiculous. You are the alpha in the jungle. Looks so sick.

93,🔥 https://t.co/fYkbRzpigO
94,Thrilled to partner with the legend @crypto888crypto. Exciting things to come for both the 888 and @OriginProtocol communities. https://t.co/kOjxe3jzD9
95,Exciting to see more web2 apps with real users (significant DAU and MAU) cross over to web3. Excited to be advising @lum_xyz on their blockchain strategy. Let's go! https://t.co/qJVQhy9Sd4
96,Congratulations to my great friends @evantana and @ajhit406 on the launch of their new fund. It's been a pleasure working with them the last couple of years. https://t.co/8J7YDVeRsd
97,@farokh @RTFKTstudios That is a SICK looking one.
98,Pick up your @DrSianProctor NFT. It's epic. https://t.co/kOv8EW6lOD
99,Bear sell off got you down. Rotate into stables and put it into $OUSD. Earning ~30% APY with no currency volatility. https://t.co/0G8lqX7TRD
