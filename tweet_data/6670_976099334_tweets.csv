53,"@crysyphus @boredgentleman Find the transaction where you called setApprovalForAll in the BAYC contract (and/or others) with the address of the OwnerDelegateProxy contract created by opensea immediately beforehand, then call the same function (setApprovalForAll) with the same addresses but this time false."
54,@boredapebot People need to remove the approval for the OwnerDelegateProxy contract created by opensea to control their tokens in the BAYC contract. I have seen people saying the have used the rovoke site and it has not worked. DM me for more info.
