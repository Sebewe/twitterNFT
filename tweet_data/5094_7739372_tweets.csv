6,"@jessicahische This is very true. The project that me and @Mikevtee created is a LOT more consuming than I initially expected. So much so that my wife, @gardenmartinis is now helping as well. But the space _is_ fun, you just have to always be the paranoid person with all things."

I'd love to use tokens for concerts. Imagine they send all token holders full size digital tour poster print for you.

Or they give anyone with 5 show tokens a vip access to their next who. 

just a simple example here."

Contract has a fun extra that may reward you with an extra token or two on mint.

84,"@midniteumbrella @secondfret @pbyrne To me, it’s just like that. I used to collect vinyl figures. The fun let was the reveal.And with nfts I love that part. 

Yes the environmental impact sucks, but they’ll fix that"
85,"@secondfret I paid an artist for their goods and I have it now. Ten years is too far out tbh. They might be seen as “lol remember that” or they’ll be like the first phase. Some I have with thoughts of selling, some I’ll keep. I’ve already made all the money I’ve spent on flipping some."
86,"@secondfret Most of them are on ipfs which is made to be on the internet forever so I’m not too worried about that. I think half of not more are worth nothing now, and I’m okay with that."
87,"@midniteumbrella @secondfret @pbyrne I own a good amount (40) of nfts. Most of them I bought strictly because of the art, I highly doubt I’ll get one of these mooning projects. If I do, cool. 

I’m also making one as well cause the tech is high stakes. 

Deploy the contract and leave a bug? TOUGH. Can’t alter."
