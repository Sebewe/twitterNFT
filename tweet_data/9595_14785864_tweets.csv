1,"This is so very true. But whilst those building will likely get it wrong right now, few will be more qualified when the dust settles…this is true of all areas of #web3 at present. Frontier stuff... https://t.co/kzXv5ZyPSH"
2,"RT @Haatch: We are backing @reflow247 as they continue on their growth journey!🚀

@simonpenson, Partner at @Haatch said: “We are delighted…"

4,@nftkal Worth further investment.
5,@RugRadio Hey. What happens if you claim via Coinbase Wallet? I see no option to import the tokens but they are 'claimed'?
6,@cryptobilbo1 @osf_nft @farokh @RugRadio My question too…?!
7,Who do I know any devs with #web3 experience at all? Looking for someone who can create a wallet connection to something I’m thinking about… #Developers #DeFi
8,@jamesagate Also the main move was down to the Russian news.
9,@jamesagate Yes.
10,@jamesagate Same is true of the stock market!
11,"Are any of my #journalist or #writers followers interested in chatting about, &amp; partnering on, a super interesting newsletter project I’m looking to launch? Would love to explain more so please do RT and drop a note in my DMs if it’s something you would be interested in pursuing."

15,@CirrusNFT Great steal! Manual process or any tools involved? I’m super keen to join the #MAYC clan…
16,@CirrusNFT Wow awesome! Someone accepted your weth offer?
17,"Today we had a fundraising #startup cancel their pitch as they were going to a big celeb awards event. This is the very signal I look for to say no early. I back #founders that are in the mine, pick axe in hand. Not those wanting to live amongst the ✨#startuptips"
18,RT @DDish123: The #lazyhat crew is more than excited to launch their own website…https://t.co/P0XwRleldk #lhdp making moves

20,@CigarLoungeNFT @Crypto__Chicks Surely fair and open access to free flowing information is the only way this scales however?!
21,@chrisbennett @RugRadio @farokh @Twitter 💪
22,@CigarLoungeNFT @Crypto__Chicks They simply can’t be aware of the roadmap. Difficult to create cut through in this noisy marketplace. This is something I’ve been thinking deeply about as a marketer. We need to find a better way of surfacing and distilling key info outside of Discord and Twitter…
23,@chrisbennett @RugRadio @farokh @Twitter How many does that make it?! 😂
24,@alexisgrant love the @TheyGotAcquired concept Alexis. Rich and valuable niche l. All too often overlooked!

31,@2xufNft @LooksRareNFT When did you start staking and at what LOOKS price did you buy in? And how often do you collect ETH rewards and swap for more LOOKS?

33,Hey @Crypto__Chicks - excited for your Time Machine Potion drop but what happens if you are away from computer access between February 16th at 9 AM PT through February 23rd at 9 AM PT?

44,@aidanhornsby @mineCityCoins 🔥🚀☝️
45,(P.S) - the communities that have made me realise this are @LazyLionsNFT @RugRadio and @AdamBombSquad so 🙏
46,(4/4) it has reminded me precisely of 2007/08 when #web2 was about to take off. This is that moment again and it’s exhilarating to see. If you’re in #web3 and building reach out as I’m ready to dive in &amp; build again..! #herestothebuilders
47,(3/4) transcend every business and life it touched. It’s where my follower base came from &amp; it built quickly. Sadly that ended several years ago as #web2 became mainstream. In short I thought Twitter was dead but in the last few weeks of diving deeper down the #web3 rabbit hole..
48,"(2/4) - for the #NFTCommunity space. Let me explain… you see, I was here in 2007 when a small bunch of zealots saw what web1 could become and how #content &amp; #social changed everything. In those days those few of us became a group that grew into an army that would eventually…"
49,"(1/4) 🧵- One more follower and I’m at 8,000. That is not a brag. It’s important for reasons that are not obvious but are important for those in #web3. Why? Because Ive seen what is happening right here &amp; now  on Twitter only once before &amp; it’s why I now have such conviction…"
50,@NFT2PRINTCOM @cryptosheep_eth @LazyLionsNFT Great job!
51,@cryptosheep_eth @LazyLionsNFT Looking forward to the transformation! #LazyLionsNFT https://t.co/eR2kgCwYDj
52,"@matthewbarby @RugRadio @osf_nft explains it better than I! - https://t.co/VNdgQzUr1T

But it (will be a) DAO media ‘company' with some groundbreaking tokenomics and a world class team…?!"
53,@alexwain Sorry I meant is the business raising money?
54,@alexwain Like this. Is it funded?
55,@matthewbarby Agreed. Have you taken a look at @RugRadio ?
56,This is only the beginning... https://t.co/lmeFWmxVHb

58,I’m interested to hear from followers new and old with deep experience in #Web3 marketing and growth and/or #Web2 senior leadership consulting where you can demonstrate that you have helped steer founders/CEOs/Exec teams on growth strategy…DMs are open!
59,@osf_nft @RugRadio Me too. The model is different in a sense but similar in other ways as that initial cash will have to be spent quickly on growth to feed further investment in the concept…
60,@ryancarson The first is an ideas DAO!:)
61,@ryancarson You’re not wrong. So. Many. Ideas 💡
62,@RugRadio 🔥🚀
63,This. https://t.co/IXcVKylQJX
64,(3/3) - will follow. I could talk all day about why I think this is the case but few have captured it more eloquently than @osf_nft - so i'll leave this here - https://t.co/VNdgQzUr1T #NFT #NFTs
65,(2/3) - it can be challenging to unravel the plethora of roadmaps. Having done that a few stand out amongst the rest (at this early stage) but the one I'm most excited about is @RugRadio - the brilliant team has spent a LOT of time building out a model DAO that I'm sure many...
66,"(1/3) 🧵- Having spent a lot of time now in the #NFTCommmunity wearing both my personal &amp; VC caps I’ve come across a lot of great ideas, people &amp; communities. For me @LazyLionsNFT has the best community out there. period. But for those looking harder for what #Web3 will become..."
67,@RandomlyLondon @ryangibsonuk @nick_eubanks oh they’ll monetise alright.
68,"@iamrofe @searchbrat @nick_eubanks ""Wordle will “initially remain free to new and existing players”” - so no:)"
69,@searchbrat Just having this exact conversation with @nick_eubanks - left soo much on the table with that level of audience growth and engagement. So much that could be done to add rev lines in there and multiply exit val.
70,"@nick_eubanks @ryangibsonuk huge audience, scaling quickly and engagement is off the charts..."
71,@ryangibsonuk @nick_eubanks Understand that and everything is relative but that’s a £100m opportunity every day of the week.

73,@CoinedPrince @LazyLionsNFT @AshurNFT Welcome 🧢
74,I love the head of steam that #WomenInCrypto led projects are building right now. It’s why I continue to back their visions. Another top 500 @Crypto__Chicks joined the vault today because of it. This is just the beginning… #girlpower #Cryptochicks https://t.co/jdB9Cg0K1F

93,@webinsane @noncoducks @CryptoDadsNFT Dads is new to me. Thanks
94,"I keep getting asked how best to explain #web3. Whilst you can talk about blockchain, DAOs etc most are still lost. The best way I have managed to get cut through is to explain the differences between 1, 2, 3 as ‘We saw, we shared and now we own’ what is your best explanation?"
95,@Jasonfaithbowen @def_leopard0 @LazyLionsNFT @loudmouthlion @DDish123 ☝️🤙
96,@crypto_rick123 ✊
97,@crypto_rick123 😊 validation for many. Celebration for one. Although I suspect it will be relative. To HODL to here suggests a fat wallet.
98,He he. And there are still doubters https://t.co/11SBqKhJgL
