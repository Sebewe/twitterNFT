75,It’s only been 6 weeks since the Space Pod was introduced. What do you think about the Space Pods and the PodX system? Let me know or gimme a gm with your clones 🔥 https://t.co/vSRtscOFFn
76,"9. ❤️Massive inclusivity

Floor price of a Clone is 15.65 ETH ($45,800). Not everyone can afford that. But the team confirmed that you don’t need a Clone to enjoy the experience.  

Space/Loot Pods/MNLTH are great entry points. That includes more people into the metaverse. 

9/9"
77,"8. 🤩 Building the metaverse, one Space Pod at a time

Instead of launching a token to raise funds to build an open metaverse, RTFKT has taken the approach to build from the ground up. Start from a small room, get the community involved, and move on to larger things. 

8/X"
78,"7. 🥵Nike’s involvement in Loot Pods

Not much has been revealed about Nike’s roadmap with RTFKT and #CloneX but having Nike’s logos in Loot Pods and the #MNLTH is a sure sign that the sporting giant is 100% on board for an epic adventure. No messy NFT sale, no cash grab. 

7/X"
79,"6. 👋🏻 Interactivity between members 

Multiplayer mode is going to be epic as members will be able to organize events (more Zen sessions, anyone?), parties, and chat rooms for the community. Foundation for a fantastic metaverse. 

6/X"
80,"5. 🤯 More extensions?!?!!

Loot pods are only the first extension of many teased by the PodX system video. One can only wonder what other extensions members are going to get and how avatars can interact with the structure.

5/X"
81,"4. 🌐 Not restricted to existing metaverses 

Instead of building directly on Sandbox or Decentraland, the team has chosen to designed beautiful space pods. This gives an awesome user experience and maximum flexibility. 

Would @RTFKTstudios acquire @oncyber_io one day??? 

4/X"
82,"3. 🔥 Burning Space Pods for upgrades

It’s confirmed that we are going to get pod upgrades in Q1 2022. 20,000 Space Pods isn’t a small number, but supply could be short if everyone buys more pods to upgrade.

83,"2. 🤝 Community collaboration

The Space Pods are open to community creations, so members can create interior designs, furnitures, decor etc. to trade &amp; exchange among each other.  

@RTFKTstudios tapping on the collective creativity. Check this out: https://t.co/5F6lttPq3t

2/X"
84,"1. 🎁 Great value

The Space Pods were airdropped to all #CloneX owners, given 1:1. The airdrops went smoothly and the value of a Space Pod went as high as 3 ETH each earlier this month (now at 1.7 ETH, almost $5,000). Holders also got Loot Pods airdrops.
