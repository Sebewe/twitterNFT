I intend to fill a smart contracts education gap by targeting a skilled audience, and introduce design patterns that worked for me."

59,"At the same time, thinking about token amounts makes irrelevant how many decimals the tokens have. If you have worked with USDC or WBTC you know the headache that decimals are."
60,@yield We all think about token prices in our contracts. Thinking about token amounts instead reduces complexity by giving an immediate meaning to our variables.
