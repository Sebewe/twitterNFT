9,@ohDotss @KaijuKingz Digging the PFP. I sense the equivalent of Smash Bros coming to the NFT space with all these blue chip communities coming together.
10,@OzarkNFT @c_oc3an How many peeps we talking? I think war FUD is definitely driving people to secure profits.
11,"@dimitrieco @NFTLlama @Syberer When @TomBilyeu @impact_theory couldn’t deliver on their execution of a 3eth mint, they did the right thing and refunded 100s of Eth to people who wanted a graceful exit. It’s definitely possible. Hats off to Tom for taking extreme ownership, @Syberer no excuses."
12,Do support organic projects from doxxed teams/founders that have a good track record and built their community from the ground up by providing value right out of the gates. Ie. @Llamaverse_ @rugburners @DarkEchelonNFT @RooTroopNFT
13,"What did we learn this week?

Don’t support hyped cash grabs from undoxxed teams/founders that have no track record and haven’t provided any value on the front-end to earn trust. Ie. @Pixelmon, @HOWLERZNFT"

89,"@Crypt0casio @FakeBusiness5 There are plenty of qualified experts who believe in vaccines that are very concerned with the rollout of this recent pharmaceutical product. They are being called “anti-vaxxers”, and their voices are not met half-way which is a true concern."
90,@Crypt0casio @FakeBusiness5 The term “anti-vaxxer” is a psy-op designed to divide people who probably have more in common than not. Who will profit from divide and conquer? Not us.
91,"@Crypt0casio @FakeBusiness5 Follow the money first, then ask questions. Anyone in any position can be bought and paid for and there is substantial evidence that they have been. So the information from captured “experts” is actually misinformation. And qualified experts that go against the grain and canceled"
