1,I don’t think ppl grok what an enormous haul 70MM USD is for *any project* let alone the epitome of low effort grift - this should make peoples blood boil - and yet ppl are doubling down buying into the Kevin meme for the lulz?! Nah fuck that. Give the money back Syberer

Let’s be real for a moment.

I love all the jokes but the fact that people are buying Kevin’s 8-9 ETH from a project that…"
4,@ColeThereum gotcha. Must have misunderstood.
5,@ColeThereum No shade but the fact you’re defending this as a dyor situation is 🤡 I mean ppl shouldn’t have to literally expect their 10k dollar investment to be a Unity asset from Upwork with zero plan for development- wtf
6,"@ColeThereum at the scale of deception (3 ETH Dutch auction with literally no product) that’s just straight scam territory. I did not buy, I don’t buy the big hype overpriced ones bc they reliably turn south (Meka, Hape, Pixelmon etc) and sure ppl should “know better” and “dyor” but cmon"
7,Shit like Pixelmon is not funny. Anyone who was around for ICO season knows this type of situation and behavior leads to at best damaged industry perception and at worst short term collapse or outright death by regulation. GET IT TOGETHER 🤯💩

11,Someone tweeted a bet ETH would hit 3200 by tomorrow and seemed awfully certain of themselves. It was at 2600 when they posted it and now (2900) Anyone else see that tweet? Do they ahh... know something I don't know? Or winging it? 🤣🎱🎲

21,"All of my @CryptoMories were listed at like 1 ETH. Well not anymore. 10 ETH floor or bust. Fuck that. This is a real project, blacklist at your peril!!!"
22,"Yes I am publicly defending @CryptoMories and the reason is they are an obvious non-threat to the world of IP theft (which I understand and empathize with) the Mories are not the problem - sorry strong guys, you got the wrong one"
23,What a fucking ironic project to target right? There are sooooo many scammy fucks out there and you go for a real one? 🤡
24,@barnrattt @opensea Trust. It’s a close friend
25,"@yachtlifebayc @CryptoMories The third option is acknowledged it was a miserable mistake and we take him back. That would be my ideal honestly, good story arc"
26,@adultarts @pr00fofsnake This reminds me of why I always advise (when asked) to long hodl projects based on the original devs. You really just never know what could happen 😉

I was trying to reach you about your cars extended warranty if that’s something you’re interested in then wtfwtfwtfwtfwtf"
28,"@2D_eth @opensea I agree with this. I think we're saying the same thing. Basically arbitrarily assuming it's Opensea's fault is like taking the most east red herring bait - don't do that - look at the situation, not the result"
29,"@SoloXioL @opensea I mean, that's just discretionary -- especially now with 
@LooksRareNFT LooksRare and @the_x2y2 x2Y2 its like, not really something to be pissy at OS about -- it's the individual issue at hand that needs addressing"
30,RT @adultarts: everyone should follow @metastash. this is life advice
31,A lot of ppl need to realize @opensea isn't at fault or the  problem if there's a DMCA -- that's an *us* problem. They're just playing by the rules. The contract is perfectly safe and fine. Nobody is getting stolen from. Whoever does the DMCA is the character you need to look at

35,@dundermifflun Because there isn't a public confirmation and I'm not in the business of slandering ppl - it looks pretty certain but not my place to confirm
36,@punk9059 @CryptoMories That ain't it tho ;)
37,"Ppl blunder from time to time, too much time spent hyper analyzing something from their own perspective. It is most definitely forgive-able. As long as responsibility is accepted and action is taken to reverse course. This situation is not fucked yet. https://t.co/GK95fLDLoX"
38,RT @cryptorso: This is web3
39,LETS BE EXTRA SUPER CLEAR: THERE IS NO CONFIRMATION OR CONCRETE REASON TO BELIEVE ITS ANY PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL AT THIS TIME. Don't cast stones before you know who you're even casting at (and probably just don't cast stones)
40,"It is not too late to see reason, internally acknowledge it was a bad idea, and be accepted back into the good graces of web3 - bc we love redemption stories - so if you're reading this, *just rescind the DMCA* and rejoin the fold as a valued collaborator where you belong"

42,"RT @Cooopahtroopa: There are more than 3 million artists on Spotify.

There are less than 500 artists minting Music NFTs.

43,Send @CryptoMories to 10 ETH floor - legit team legit Art absolutely do not deserve to be railroaded - let’s not let them wither on the vine!
44,@CryptoMories I was planning to sell one or two a while ago but F that!!! I’m keepin em all now!
45,@KrayTrain @CryptoMories I mean there’s no way to determine from parsing my wallets I have a little bit of everything - but the truth will out soon enough

51,"Open message to the individual who DMCA’ed @CryptoMories:

Whether you feel this is legitimate or are acting from a place of scarcity and greed, it is a transparently bad move that will have severe repercussions on your own web3 legacy. Plz. See reason. Rescind the DMCA"
52,RT @R0MANIAKK: you have no idea how bad we need this guy's voice to be heard loud and clear in this space at this time and always... #LFG @…
53,Asking for a DMCA on @CryptoMories is getting pretty petty. You have to be in a real scarcity mentality to be a successful project trying to shut THOSE folks down — they’re creative and unique and additive — go after some actual scam! Kind of a bad look for whoever initiated that
54,"@R0MANIAKK @Clubhouse Means a lot. The shift from Clubhouse to Spaces did not take for me, I just couldn’t adapt to that way of doing things. It was a tighter knit and more pioneering vibe in the clubhouse days. I’d love to get back into it tho 🤷 feels like NFTs need more voices of reason again 🤣"
55,This tweet is def working tho - I will make a list of good feedback and links after the conversation moves on
56,@Cooopahtroopa
57,@LoBo_301 I guess I’m referring more to a platform that leverages the music NFT concept better than just shoehorning it into the Opensea model. Think distributes web3 Spotify or something
58,@xedraism catalog .works and sound .xyz are new to me. I’m a little bent about u can’t be serious tho - do you think these are obvious and easy to find by comparison w the amount of music NFT buzzword use on twit? I assure you they’re not evenly matched. Looking to see what evolves
59,Everyone is talking about music NFTs. Where are these music NFTs? Wtf are you talking about?! Is there a platform I don’t know about for music NFTs? I’m hype about it too but I don’t honestly see WHERE THEY ARE
60,Pixelmon amirite 🙄🤣🤷‍♂️
61,"@Coinbase_NFT This is a real no brainer. Polygon has long term viability. Solana is fun for sure but brass tacks, it’s just not it on an extended time horizon. Alt L1s are awesome don’t get me wrong, but Polygon is an actual important player"

63,@OrganicStonez Very sorry to hear. Is your wallet compromised or was it another vector? Reason I ask is I don’t want to buy anything from Opensea etc that would send money to a compromised wallet and not make it to you!
64,@the_x2y2 Listen I appreciate the sentiment but the fact that a brand new platform is indicating interest in building a *different platform* is a bad look. Focus on doing what you're doing and doing it well. You start spreading yourself thin and x2y2 goes straight to shit
65,With all the $WOOL value on the line I'd be surprised to find that @wolfdotgame and the surrounding A8's and OGs haven't put together a large reserve of liquid to buy the price back up from these unspeakable levels... right? RIGHT?
66,So what did I have to do to be on the invisible friends mint list? I didn't look into that. Kind of regretting it now bc there's not a sliver of a chance that you'll catch me buying on secondary unrevealed unproven projects at 10 ETH out the gate 😬😂🤷‍♂️

80,"@crypto_corgis @fragosti Corgis are a relatively early work of NFT art, the minting experience was totally unique — I have a dozen or so and I’m guessing at some point in the future ppl will finally come to their senses and the market will price them appropriately"
