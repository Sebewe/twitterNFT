21,@HermanIngram9 @BluesyCrypto Hmm. You have a point. No one said it has to be 1 on 1 though. 😅
22,"@BluesyCrypto Idk, I saw someone suggest we just put the world leaders in a ring and they can fight it out with each other instead of getting innocent people involved and I thought it was a pretty decent take."

The point is that the violence of war is mostly senseless and unnecessary and we hate it, not that it’s perpetrated by people of a certain gender."
33,"@NFTsAnonymous @skyrooster303 We’re all feeling very strong emotions, to be sure. Let that not make us quick to lash out at people of like mind who detest war and violence. My statement was a somber reflection on all of history and the senselessness of war. Please don’t color my words as anything but."
