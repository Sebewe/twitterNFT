0,@orange__ape I got one because it saved my friend's mom's life. It detected that she had an irregular heart beat and doctors were able to take action much earlier than they would've otherwise.
1,"@void__runners My grandfather was an aerospace engineer and I loved hearing him talk about space, technology, and exploration as a kid. He encouraged me to always remain curious."
2,@tropoFarmer Let's keep prices where they are for a minute. I need to add another to the collection. https://t.co/OnvC9OhryT
3,@BENCHUCHUU GM Ben!
4,@Zeneca_33 I considered buying one a couple days ago for .67. Kicking myself for not going with my gut.

He's 100% good vibes, generous, humble, and would definitely add value to our ZenAcademy community."
15,"@opensea Was sending an email to BAYC owners a while back, with everyone’s emails exposed on CC a vector of attack?"
16,@k8be24ever_rcf @JunicsETH Or upgrade to a Grid+ and use a seaparate smart card as your vault. You’ll actually be able to read what you’re signing too.
17,@sherjan @flyosity Almost https://t.co/RnX90Mk2if
18,@degensad @BoredApeYC Definitely. That beautiful multi used to be mine. He's still looking sharp.
19,Just finished revoking access from OpenSea on all NFTs. Done using them. I'll stick to @LooksRareNFT 100% from now on.
20,@OGDfarmer @gridplus My @gridplus stopped working on OpenSea as of yesterday for listing. Guessing something to do with their new contract.
21,"@Zeneca_33 @ZenAcademy_ I’m already in, but would love to see @DamnGee3 or @yoman301 with a 🔮"
22,@Leontin77301014 Piss off.
23,Attempting to list something for sale on @opensea is no longer working with my @gridplus Lattice1. I sign the transaction w/ MM but it doesn't go to HW wallet for signing. This started after the migration. Anyone else having this problem?
24,@BlueBadger2600 I'm skipping it. Feels like an amateur project and I have no trust in them.
25,I'll stick with @LooksRareNFT and @opensea. Zero trust for @the_x2y2. https://t.co/zVE6jdTTAQ
26,"@the_x2y2 People aren't complaining about the rules. They're complaining that you had them do one thing, at a cost, then said that cost was for nothing. Now do something else at a cost. You're NGMI with that kind of view of people you want as customers."
27,@NftCelestials @the_x2y2 Not planning on using @the_x2y2 after this. Blatantly shitty right out the gate.
28,@nolantherealtor @the_x2y2 Same question @the_x2y2. I listed 3 the other day and now I don’t qualify? That’s $50 in gas wasted.
29,@steven_schill I like to put ponzu schemes on top of my food pyramid schemes.
30,@evanodette @supergremplin I bought a Bort Sampson one night after drinking too much. https://t.co/HjGcIjn2G2
31,@arcadedotinc 👀
32,@Feld4014 Cheetah + Holo + Merch = 🔥
33,@NonFungibleNoah Yes please
34,@HOWLERZNFT @NonFungibleNoah @supergremplin Hoping it doesn't drop while I'm asleep.
35,@TheeHustleHouse @ensdomains raves.eth
36,@budlight $399 is so expensive. I wish they were 0.13eth.
37,"@blkck I say this as someone who has a large collection of rave/club flyers spanning decades. I have poly NFTs that I love, but I've also been handed a ton that go straight in the bin."
38,Receiving a Polygon NFT is like getting handed a flyer when leaving a club.
39,@HollanderAdam I'm just loading up on more. LR &gt; OS.
40,"@Ledger Then he plugs it in, gets an overheating error message, contacts support and gets no response for weeks. Ends up buying a @gridplus Lattice1 instead and is better off."
41,@_v3gapunk @BoredApeYC Tweed + holo + grin = 🔥
42,@NFTRambo90 I’ve got to try this next time. Well played. 👏
43,Hopped out of bed to mint a couple @polysart https://t.co/Kc0UFlN2Ts
44,@PltTiger @renegademasterr @Cryptilt @BoredApeYC @punkscomic @coolcatsnft @GutterCatGang @RumbleKongs @jenkinsthevalet @Deadfellaz @ThePixelmon RTFKT also had a history of delivering on projects.
45,@NFTBuffet I'd be more disappointed if they wasted money on a Superbowl ad.
46,"@bp22 On 10k projects, absolutely. I can support up to 10% royalty for 1 of 1 art though."
47,@Loopifyyy That video is the real crime.
48,@cityapez I’d go with Looks.

52,@Benadryll_ Heard OS is moving to no rewards at all and higher fees. Oh wait...
53,@PuffYatty RIP the people who minted for 3ETH.
54,"@SlamDiegoZoo @LooksRareNFT OpenSea benefits are zero. I’ll take the still very high halved benefits. Even if the benefits were going to zero, I’d still choose LooksRare for the lower fees, decentralization, and responsive team."
55,@LagunitasIQ @jenkinsthevalet 💯
56,@apehammer Zombie is best choice for mutant mouths.
57,@azfnft This non-🐳 remains bullish and will continue staking and reaping what's still a great return at 50%.
58,@cryptostout The rewards at 50% of what they are now are still pretty incredible. Rewards are 100% less at OpenSea. Most people are terrible at financial decisions.
59,@NateNFT @LooksRareNFT Both
60,Love this sneak peek (right) that @BENCHUCHUU shared the other day for @DreamlandGEN. https://t.co/RHxaXRDCv2
61,@Daedalus_Mutant @BoredApeYC Nice ape!
62,"@sadsigns_ @LooksRareNFT I go out of my way to try getting a seller to put their listing up on LR now when I’m buying something. Makes no sense to only list on OS, unless you hate money and decentralization."
63,@zerobeta https://t.co/henNy6ysCr
64,@Investors_Keep @DreamlandGEN I have offers pending on a bunch more. 😉

68,@boredgentleman @LooksRareNFT I harvested my weth and staked more looks last night. I checked LR just now I already have $45 in weth in just 16 hours. If I checked OS right now the site would probably be down.
