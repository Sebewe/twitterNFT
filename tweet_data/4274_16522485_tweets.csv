7,"We cannot let our friends and communities down by enabling their laziness. Helping them ride the crypto train means helping them learn to help themselves. To learn how the mechanisms work and to know that ultimately, their buck stops with them."
8,"Many will lose out along the way. They will be hacked. They will lose their keys. They will lose life savings. They will yell and scream at the world for having it out for them. Yet all the while, they were let down by best intentions."
9,In true crypto form - it's the financial incentives that will help them overcome inertia and get them started on their journey. The stories abound of financial freedom people have reached will encourage them to push through the immense learning curves ahead of them.
10,And it's this exact behavior we need to try to eradicate in our peers as they struggle to learn this space that we are now dominating. Why? Because if they don't learn to be resourceful in an adversarial environment they will ultimately become a victim.
11,"It's this exact shortcut, performed time and again, which enables those who aren't good at being resourceful to continue to do so. They aren't forced to take ownership of their learnings and thus lean on others who have invested the time."
12,The difficultly is that nearly everyone I know is overwhelmed with their online demands for their time - chat threads in numerous platforms for instance - and struggles to keep up. A common shortcut employed is to ask the group rather than do the homework yourself.
13,"Living and practicing radical self reliance however is a cornerstone of crypto and web3. It rewards those who have the privilege of time to invest in learning how it works, and of taking responsibility of their choices."
14,"This is stressful for those who've grown up in the web2 world which enables us continually with those seemingly benign ""Forgot username or password"" links."
15,I then pepper them with stories about the power your private key (basically the password behind every crypto wallet) holds over your funds: it is everything. Someone gets it - everything is gone. You lose it? Gone. You forget it? Gone. You die or become incapacitated? Gone.
16,"When teaching friends and family about crypto, the first thing I always start with is OpSec: do you have a password manager? No - get one. Stop using the same password and relying on memory or custom algorithms. 2FA all the things via an app, not SMS. No more numerical PINs. Etc."
17,While speaking to some friends interested in web3 today it became apparent to me just how much crypto has influenced my beliefs. Not just on self sovereignty but also on radical self reliance (a term I've lifted from the 10 Principles of Burning Man). 🧶

25,"6. Comfort. Hosts should really be reminded that a small investment in bed linen and towels will go a long way. For a frequent traveler in a foreign home, a comfortable bed is an absolute must."
26,"5. Kitchens. Plenty of nomads are now very much into cooking post pandemic. A detailed list of kitchen supplies, along with a commitment from hosts to keep their kitchen in good working order is imperative. Things like a working oven and a blender are essential."
27,4. Water. A water filter is a must in all homes. In particular for developing countries this prevents an obscene amount of plastic bottle usage.
28,"3. Ratings. Guests should not feel afraid of harsh ratings when let down. If a host receives a bad rating, they can drop their rates until such time as a rating is smoothed out. Potentially allow future guests to rate more extreme reviews to allow hosts to iron these out"
29,"2. Beyond WiFi. Hosts should also use solid routers. I now travel with a Google Home WiFi as some homes have routers that fail after 4+ devices are attached. Hosts should also report on cellular coverage at their property, with the best providers and associated speed tests."
30,"1. WiFi. Speed test are useful, but a) can be faked via a different network, b) only shows the speed at the time of test, c) doesn't show up speeds. To fix this, hosts should be encouraged to update the results regularly and guests should be able to post verifications."

42,"5/ The path forward hasn't been easy for @optimismPBC, but the decisions they've made demonstrate that they deeply understand their role in this. Instead of storming ahead full of hubris, they've re-evaluated their path and have chosen simplicity for us, despite the cost to them."
43,"4/ Beyond tooling and security, by integrating successfully, you reduce the overhead on engineers - there are less idiosyncrasies for them to learn and recall - allowing them to focus on their job of simply creating."
44,3/ It's not about creating the best possible technical solution to a problem - which is often the domain of academics - but rather developing one that leverages the best part of an existing system and infrastructure; especially when the existing system *works* - as the EVM does.
45,"2/ Ever since we first worked with them in 2019, it's been incredibly obvious to @kaiynne and I that they simply ""get it"". They understand intuitively how creating a successful technology works:"
46,"1/ People often ask ""Why Optimism?"" for @synthetix_io. I've always been very explicit - they are the closest thing to the existing EVM. This means less surface area to maintain, improving security but even more critically reducing cognitive overhead for the team.

53,"@andyteecf Right but that’s still dependent on fetching state for you. I’m thinking about situations when you know exactly the payload you want to submit, you just need to get it signed."
54,Qu: are there any hosted crypto services with h/w wallet support that allows you to sign any transaction payload you give it? Useful in cases where someone has a h/w wallet and a stuck transaction and they need to cancel or replace it by hand when tools like MM fail.
