78,also labeling your sexuality is not “using pronouns” y’all sound dumb as hell
79,"yeah not a huge fan of everyone hating on people for having pronouns in their bio. please, literally everyone uses pronouns. grow up"
80,the ape pfp ain’t doing too bad tho
81,if I posted a pic of myself I could get followers just because I look really feminine and that’s hilarious

97,Also y’all make it painfully obvious you haven’t felt the touch of a woman in a while. like imagine thinking you’d need to spend 250k to meet a woman at a NFT meet and greet. maybe just try being a decent human instead lmaooo
98,assuming there is something inherently racist about a monkey…. says a lot about you
