63,"@GitKnocked @sparktwain_eth I think we all hear one side of story and do not know what the discussion about. I rather the outcome is both of them can collaborate in a project, it will be win win for this space. For me we need to protect Mories brand value as well and it’s not just define by the logo."
64,"@GitKnocked @sparktwain_eth I get what u trying say. IMO, The innocent comment is oso becos of the brand value of Mories and not becos of the logo. Nevertheless, I hope middle ground can be reached."
