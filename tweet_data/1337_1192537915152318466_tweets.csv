13,@mcfresh85 @tranquil_fi @0xMightyM I’ll say it again. If you’re making money I’m happy for you. Stop getting butt hurt because people are expressing their opinions. That’s what Twitter is for.

26,"@birdcallprrr_ @CasualKIBA @tranquil_fi @0xMightyM It ain’t cancel culture dude, it’s just common sense.
