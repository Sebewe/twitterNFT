1,"Peer verification systems also only work in a truly one-person one-vote system. Until we can prove uniqueness and set examples of DAOs that are Sybil resistant, any peer verification system is useless."
2,"The more money it takes to verify someone (the more rewards given), the stronger the counter signal should be to the community about the quality of that verification. Having both the requester and verifiers data and rewards on-chain makes this all public."
3,"The weaker a professional or social relationship is, the more material that needs to be introduced to compensate for the “opportunity cost”. In a peer verification system, if I have a weak relationship with someone, but want their verification, I will send more rewards."
4,"For some reason, we value the time of people we care about most the least. Ex: people are more afraid to waste 10 minutes of a strangers time over their moms. When we value time more, we feel a sense of “guilt” when we take it away and provide gifts to make up for it."
5,"If we introduce rewards for peer verification of off-chain tasks to build reputation, it should be clear that there is an inverse relationship between the verifiers rewards and quality of the verification.

8,"to fund paradigm shifting work often means funding risky ideas which are less favored by consensus based models. small, aggressive, centralized, fast deployers of capital are far more efficient for high-risk high-reward projects."

10,@CharlieSandor 100% agree. My framing was more so apriori decentralization that we do not need to unnecessarily design for this composability yet.

31,"No, the relationship with my mother does not need to be put on-chain."
32,"Top 5% of engineering talent doesn't need LinkedIn or a personal website today to get a job.

We will do the same in Web3. Our identity will not be put on-chain to ""unlock bounties"". 

The best teams will the find best talent and pay for it regardless of what is put on-chain."

35,5. These results oracles and retroactive funding models do not need to be exclusively used for public good funding but can also be used to change investment behavior in DAOs that focus on early stage investment.
36,4. Contributors should be made aware of a “results oracle” that protocols have created to reward projects retroactively for their utility. Individuals become more risk tolerant as the expected return changes dramatically with the results protocol in place.
37,3. Low-risk projects are often in the best interest of the public to contribute to for individual expected return. Quadratic funding models favor low-risk proposals as matched donations are dependent on consensus from the most number of people. https://t.co/oxN67PEhyu
38,"2. To push the frontiers of human progress, ARPA styled agencies understand the importance of funding high-risk high-reward projects. The decisions are made in a centralized manner, making it easier to support risk and expedite time to fund."
39,"1. Current decentralized funding models don't favor high-risk high-reward proposals. To solve human coordination failures, we need to fund risky projects. A results oracle for retroactive funding will change contribution behavior to enable this.
