24,"@SlowSteady10 As an investor, if you turn this into a rule then you will inevitably miss out on great opportunities. I haven’t found what you’re describing to be worthy of turning into a rule. Some of the best founders I know do not rock their own PFP, and vice versa."

32,"@SlowSteady10 Yup. I advocate for preventing burnout on an individual basis. I have seen too many founders and teams think burnout is a global issue within their organization, when it isn’t. People experience burnout for very different reasons. One-size-fit-all solutions aren’t very effective."
33,@OzarkNFT @EthaliensNFT 🚀
34,@SlowSteady10 Expectations with customers need to be managed (in this case investors/community members). This is where experience or great advice helps founders a ton. Burnout is an individual problem that shouldn’t be treated as a symptom though which is what you have been implying afaik.
35,"@SlowSteady10 @JaduHologram Hah, I’m not suggesting a 1-2 person show. We’re clearly texting past each other here. I am a founder, investor and advisor. My perspective encompasses all of those seats, so to speak. Burnout is a very particular problem in organizations. It’s a result not a symptom."
36,@SlowSteady10 @JaduHologram Burnout is preventable without breaks. That’s the nicer way to put it.
37,"@CateTV @Edenhorde @OruJoy Yup, a friend clued me in so I have one. Joining the journey :)"
38,@SlowSteady10 Burnout is what happens when you don’t know what you are doing.
39,"@SlowSteady10 The biggest risk is that founders are in over their heads and had no idea whatsoever what they were getting into when they decided to start a NFT project. This is not a burnout issue, it’s ignorance and naïveté. Let’s not spread that idea that burnout and breaks are the path."

54,"@SirWilliamEth @nftworldsNFT Pressure is strong, just about every project is now thinking about creating on NFT Worlds versus Sandbox. I think the market sentiment has already shifted with early adopters. Once play to earn experiences are used, very likely that Sandbox will be a secondary option for most."
55,@karrisaarinen @TrustVanta We use Vanta at Nira. But this is quite a bold statement from you without more context.

58,"@NFTLlama @psychedelic_nft @RooTroopNFT @MetaMooseNFT @SappySealsNFT @EthaliensNFT Web 2.0 started out transparent too. Open source really took off during that era. Web3 has taken the exact same path so far, the biggest consideration is the financial motivations clouding a lot of people’s judgements about how to run a project AND how to invest in them too."
