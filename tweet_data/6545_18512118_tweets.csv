87,"@Bamboozii_AS @InternetLurker_ @xMooneyToken I’m going to push for consolidation into 99% BNB, BTC or USD. Especially until this market proves otherwise. We can always revisit this down the line. Also price impact on transactions will be consistent and higher price impacts will be mitigated to an extent."
88,@Bamboozii_AS @InternetLurker_ @xMooneyToken The flash loan/arbitrage opportunities are negatively affecting the total liquidity. Consistent $1-$150 opportunities for flash loans are not benefiting the bottom line which is to continually grow liquidity. On top of having to balance LP which isn’t free.

92,@papacthulu That’s a great hash per dollar deal not counting electric. $1700 per unit is insane.
93,"@xMooneyToken, soon I will be opening a proposal for us to vote on as a community. It will be regarding our current liquidity pairs. Currently BNB, BTC, ETH, BUSD, &amp; XUSD are paired to xM. I believe we should consolidate into one LP. I would love to get a community pulse on this."

95,@Jennifa_Crypto @papacthulu Last AAPE to leave your wallet was 31 days ago and doesn’t look like the hack which occurred today. Looks like your wallet sold it for .4 eth.
96,@Jennifa_Crypto @papacthulu You got Tx hash?
97,"And to the neigh sayer’s, @papacthulu knows his way around blockchain. I learned a few things today."
98,"To sum it up, be careful what you sign or approve of acting on your behalf."
99,There were some pretty cool @opensea pages we landed on related to the account. Also looked like the hacker tested the ability to successfully perform the heist on a crappy frog NFT. Which also led us to a page that had Mr. Robot as the PFP.
