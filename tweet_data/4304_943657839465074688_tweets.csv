16,"@flurnft Genuine sleeper project, the amount of utility being made is ridiculous"
17,@CreepyClubNFT My body is ready
18,"4) Lastly decided to unlist however Binance hasn't enabled a feature to withdrawn NFT's from their marketplace. Apparently it is coming sometime in Oct. 
Overall, @TheBinanceNFT has a long way to go before being viable, @opensea seems to be the viable choice for listing NFT's atm"
19,"3) once in your wallet I decided to place a listing, listing take Binanace 8-12hrs to approve, however in my case took roughly 20hrs. Once listed it didnt appear on the approving corgi marketplace, instead the system thinks i've minted it myself..."
20,"2) to list a nft there you have to transfer and pay gas much like Opensea, difference is you have transfer to binance Marketplace which will take 15-20min's before it shows up in your wallet..."
21,"My thoughts/experience with @TheBinanceNFT a thread:
1) Decided to list 1 nft of @approvingcorgis as they just partnered with Binance as to test the functionality compared to Opensea."
22,@ShmooNFT Good Morning/Night
23,@dogefan69 @approvingcorgis Probably nothing
24,"@flurnft @approvingcorgis is hugely focused on building a strong community, and providing the best utility they can for holders. Super Underrated!
The transparency of this group is nothing to be joked about #nft #Underrated"

72,"@officialmcafee Do i also believe everything I read, not a chance.
U.S. is 100% lying about their figures as would other countries, some are even ""asking"" people to use a gov app to track their movement. Look at Australia for instance. Pretty much say they will reduce restrictions if you use it."
73,"@officialmcafee What about New Zealand? Some of the lowest death per a capita. Been stage 4 restrictions for a month, higher lock down measures than the US by far. People still going to the beach in America, can only have 1 person go to supermarkets in NZ."
