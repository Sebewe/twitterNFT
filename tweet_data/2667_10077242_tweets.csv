61,"When I shared these thoughts with an NFT trader friend, he laughed at me and my naive notion that there is *any* smart money in the market.

Well, what can I say, I'm an optimist. I think there are smart ppl making smart investments into viable projects even in this market."
62,"By this, btw, I don't mean that *everything* is going to zero. At least I don't think so. But I do suspect that we still have some very severe market corrections to come before all the dumb money is flushed out of the market and some semblance of rationality returns."
63,"At the time, I also selfishly wished for one last good pump to unload at least some of my bags. Feels like we got it in January. I hope you too did a bit of risk management in that period, and got out of projects where you could and moved the money into longer term value."

72,"Just how low are we talking? Well, looking at the stacked bar charts 45d report... The last 6 hours has seen the lowest amount of sales in 45 days.

I think not."
75,"The market health index has duly responded by forming a new all time low.

Can we go lower? Yes ser, we sure can, we could have volumes entirely drop off. If no one lowers their prices, that is, imho, what will happen. https://t.co/vG5sUVXZRH"
76,"Right so... yeah. I mean, so much for that hope that the volumes would flatten or start going up again. This time we didn't even manage three higher bars... The top ten projects made about 10 sales total in the last 6 hours. Across all ten projects. https://t.co/wXbbluNQRZ"
