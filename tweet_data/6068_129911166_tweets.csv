10,@djboothEIC It’s really hard to believe empire doesn’t know? I don’t want anyone losing their jobs but it’s a sucky practice.
11,@djboothEIC What sucks about this is. I know legit A&amp;Rs at labels that charge people to listen to “review” their music. It’s really sad to be honest.

29,@DomGiavonni @djofresh @djboothEIC I’ve been with AWAL for a while. They have responsive support and can hurry releases if you request. But I feel like they only deliver the label aspect to a particular looking and sounding artist.

Ngl I’d almost re-enroll in school just to be apart of this program like they did in the internship. Being in industry adjacent places like indianapolis and jersey this would have been perfect"
47,@cburgereth @CosmosKidzNFT Yo that’s crazy. This looks like artwork from an Uzi album

68,@Nicholai_INC @opensea @opensea_support Wait what?
69,Wow https://t.co/cN4954pZ5a
70,@NFTloverman That’s fair. Long term I think it’ll do super well. Imo it’s the number 2 alternative to openseas. Especially once people stop listing sales a crazy amount above what it’s listed for on OS
71,"@NFTloverman That is also true. I just don’t have a lot of looks invested and it’s almost at a loss from when I got in 😂 
I should run the math to see if it makes sense. 
Everyone I see talk extra positive about looks has like 10x more invested than I do"
72,"@JackieMoooon Most of my followers aren’t nft fans yet so I’m always on the defensive lol 

If it’s a good project for the most part it’s a solid investment. 
If you take a loss I always view it as a cost of networking. I got to meet new people in a new space. And a win is a win lol."
73,@JackieMoooon If this is sarcasm sorry lol
74,@JackieMoooon I’ve already pulled out enough profits to have made money on my initial investment so this is all house money at this point. But I for sure think eth is hitting the 22k that it’s projected to this year. Especially after it’s integrated into Apple Pay &amp; eth 2.0 drop this year
75,Am I crazy for thinking I should sell some $looks to eth right now? And then buy back in when eth goes back up?
76,"Just seen a nft say the public mint was .2 eth 
Yeah no"
77,@ItsPaigeElisse Yo this shit keep getting wilder and wilder and wilder
