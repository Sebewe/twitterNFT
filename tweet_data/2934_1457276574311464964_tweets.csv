I'm thrilled to have found my forever Dood. 

Team, community, aesthetics, conviction, and joy - all represented in my favourite PFP ever.

11,"@AndyTheNguyen @BoredApeYC I think time will tell for all of us.

Spending thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars on NFTs could mean either that were incredibly smart, or incredibly stupid.

That outcome hasn't been determined yet."

60,"@metazord_eth @PJETCH @mrmakerbot This week will be a testing time of price discovery for IF. Listings are currently outnumbering sales by around 50:1. 

They'll need to hold firm collectively to maintain the floor and be able to sustain without day 1 hype and volume.

Breaking ranks could start a downtrend."
61,"@LMA_nftcocktail @FlurETH Thanks, Fren! I'm rooting for you. I think they're dope.

Nice work on the sweet pull."
62,@SkiddilyNFT @TodorSrbinovski Brilliant thread.
63,"@Gee__Gazza Seems like at the light-speed we operate, Karafuru is 'very January 2022'.

It is no longer - it seems - 'the best community by far' &amp; 'my new favourite PFP'.

Perhaps that's what happens with the masses in the unforgiving NFT market right now. It's not a 'bluechip', so move on."
64,@DoodleBotOS An absolute steal! Well done.
65,"5. Accumulating pre-reveals hoping for a rare is obviously risky. Although better odds that most high-value rewards, you're still looking a 1:'000's odds.

6. We're all Degen's, even the whales."
66,"2. When trading at such magnitudes, dollar/eth losses and gains are significant.

3. Exiting a big position is obviously going to be difficult.

4. Selling in pumps is an obvious strategy, but if you're stuck below your cost price average - you're taking Ls."
67,"...a lowest possible value of 375 ETH (12.5 ETH x 30) or $992,516.25. A $300,000 profit. Higher floor price obviously increases his profit margins significantly.

So, what do we learn?

1. NFT trading is inherently and obviously high-risk."
68,"If the floor trends downward, Flur is looking at serious loss. Imagine 3-5 ETH, which would equate to somewhere around $350,000 loss.

However, the upside risk is obviously phenomenal. If IF matched #Doodles in some reasonably quick timeframe, Flur's bag would have.."
69,"If price did trend downward, Flur may need to exit strategically (without tanking the market). However, we all know that this is difficult when competing with motivated buyers. 

Ultimately, Flur operates at a different level to most people, but parallels can be drawn."
70,"2. Offload the more aesthetically valuable/rarer IFs at higher prices to offset the current deficit.

A more difficult position for Flur would be if the price discovery trends downward. Flur may have an exit strategy in place, a stop-loss of sorts."
71,"Flur is a professional trader who lives &amp; dies based upon the trades he executes. I presume he read's the room well on what will perform long-term.

Flur has a few viable options;

1. HODL untill the floor price surpasses his purchase cost average."
72,"1) Trying to bag a rare (which was a stated aim of Flur).

2) Having long-term belief in the project (Flur does).

3) Trading pre-reveal/post-reveal volatility (which Flur has not done - traded none so far)."
73,"At current 6.75 ETH floor Flur has a bag with a lowest possible value of 202.50 ETH ($533,994.53), which if realised would be a 61.03 ETH ($161,530.04) loss.

How did Flur get into this position? Flur knows well that projects will dip post-reveal. So the 3 possible reasons are;"
74,"I wanted to quickly run the numbers on @FlurETH's trade. Not to be in any way disrespectful, but to see if there anything mere mortals can learn.

Flur has been super transparent. 263.755 ETH ($695,524.57) on 30 Invisible Friends at a cost average of 8.79 ETH per unit. https://t.co/CoDb8ZB1eW"

77,@ArcanicNFT 💪
78,"@QDub_7 A thoughtful post.

Undoubtedly some overestimate their NFT prowess due to getting exceptionally lucky in the very recent past.

Given the fickle nature of this space, there is probably a parallel universe where #BAYC is an obscure, valueless, forgotten NFT in a bunch of wallets."

82,"@PuffYatty My honest opinion, I like them a lot. I think they're novel and fun. Future will strongly depend on what the team do in the next 3, 6, 12 months.

However, I don't think they're great as a PFP (yet), they're still deep in price discovery.

I would (and will) buy at 3ETH."
83,@papastubs @doodles @burnttoast It is! Welcome. Great #Doodle.

My best guess, 4-5E."

93,@RossHeadroom This is an exceptionally sensible policy.
94,"@0xwinky @InvsbleFriends @doodles And I should add, I'm sincerely hoping that they are. I'm also standing poised to snatch one if they dip into budget range."
95,"@0xwinky @InvsbleFriends @doodles Agreed. I've seen a few peeps today questioning if the whole project is animated - I thought that was a given.

It'll be an absolute bloodbath if they're not.

Will you go back and look at what your IF pulled? I can't help myself. 😂"
96,@0xwinky @InvsbleFriends @doodles I think that was a really good call.
97,"@CryptoCam03 @tommyk_eth @InvsbleFriends Is there even a chance that they're not animated? I thought that was a given.

I'd imagine a bit of a bloodbath of the floor if they're static."
