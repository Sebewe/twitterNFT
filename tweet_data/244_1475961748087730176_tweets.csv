21,"It was tough to see my sad suit ape go today, but I'm excited to welcome this aesthetic pizza ape and his mutant, as well as these two insane red Azuki brothers 🔥

We're just getting started @AzukiZen 🚀 https://t.co/p8LrxTo3nE"
22,@ron1ndoteth @AzukiZen @SA1NT99 Congrats on the purchase! 🔥🪨⚡️
23,"@ron1ndoteth I believe this Azuki would also qualify as an unofficial 1/1, as the only triple elemental 😉 https://t.co/7hDSAECYEa"
24,"@Ape7068 @AzukiZen @OGDfarmer @steamboy33 Yea, I noticed this one too! Definitely a 1/1 as it's the only non spirit with spirit hair, like you mentioned. Also blue on blue which adds to the rarity factor. Really cool how you can see the earphones through her hair."
25,@SterfryGalli @netflame @AzukiFable Tbh I dont really care too much about rarity. Aesthetics rules all and our Azukis are some of the best looking imo
26,@netflame @SterfryGalli @AzukiFable Ah I see. Yea I found him pretty late when floor for fire hairs was around 40. Glad to have gotten in or I would've missed the train 😅
27,"@SterfryGalli @netflame @AzukiFable Hey we're all next level here ✊️
Our Azukis look like theyre going super saiyan haha"
28,@netflame @SterfryGalli @AzukiFable Yea I got extremely lucky finding him at 30. Idk why but seems like seller was in a rush
29,@SterfryGalli @netflame @AzukiFable Y'all got some handsome Azukis 🔥 https://t.co/pCJPH8NSMG
30,@RosebudRevival @AzukiZen It's from the main @AzukiZen account :)

33,@RedAzuki @AzukiZen Making me blush 😊
34,@CrytpoToad @AzukiZen Glad to have helped! Thanks a bunch and I'm sure @kentabeanfarmer appreciates it as well :)
35,@Atulipfarmer He's definitely in good 💎🙌
36,@Atulipfarmer Wow congrats on the golden spirit! Definitely hit the jackpot there. I'm glad that I'm not the only one who noticed how unique this bean was :)
37,"@metawuhuama @ron1ndoteth @docmonnfriends @AzukiZen @ZZZAGABOND Agreed, and I strongly believe community comes first. It's just fun to explore the possibilities as well 😉"
38,@QueensGambit01 @AzukiZen Yea he immediately caught my eye cuz of how red he was lol
39,"@sadaf_eth @AzukiZen Thanks, yea that was one idea in particular I wanted to explore with this Azuki. I feel like the possibility of giving your Azuki a personality and life is such a fun idea :)

And yea definitely see you in the garden !ikz"
40,@ron1ndoteth @Archiveus__ I love theorycrafting like this. So much fun to explore the possibilities
41,@ron1ndoteth @AzukiZen @ZZZAGABOND Dang I didn't notice this! That'd be so dope if the golden ticket played some role in the future 👀
42,@RedAzuki @AzukiZen Wow love how clean your Azuki is! We're on the same wavelength haha
43,@otter_eth @AzukiZen Haha I'll let you know if I find any more ;)
44,@Arthur_0x @ChipNFT @SA1NT99 Yea the twin sisters are amazing! 4 animal traits were my first discovery haha
45,@docmonnfriends @AzukiZen Hey! Sorry if it came off like I was saying my Azuki is better than others. I was moreso speaking in terms of symbolism due to the significance of the red bean. Completely agree that all Azukis are equally great! Love your spirit and it's also the only spirit with a skateboard!
46,@BasedStoic @AzukiZen Welcome to the fire hair gang! https://t.co/9oBuVp0sbK
47,@BlkChnShinobi @AzukiZen Really appreciate the kind words! Love your cowboy Azuki btw :) !ikz
48,"@FUBZAR @AzukiZen @ZZZAGABOND @steamboy33 Oh wow, that's super exciting to hear!

Also, yea I can definitely see the resemblance. Dang this might be one of the cleanest beans I've seen recently"
49,"@FUBZAR @AzukiZen Exactly! That's been one of my favorite parts of browsing through countless Azukis. Also, a huge +1 to the story point. It's still up in the air whether these 1/1s are just easter eggs, but it would be amazing if they incorporated them into the lore somehow."
50,@Thilexlol @AzukiZen Thanks! I still have much to learn as well. Let's all grow in the garden as beans :)
51,@li_cool @AzukiZen Same! Perfect for Lunar New Year :)
52,"@MikiPixel @pizookie1 @AzukiZen On second thought, I have a feeling they won't get along 🤔"
53,@MikiPixel @pizookie1 @AzukiZen Haha that would be the dream
54,@Paranoidbeauty2 @AzukiZen Our beans can practically be brothers!
55,"@Paranoidbeauty2 @AzukiZen I may be a red bean, but I also love my blue beans as well ;) https://t.co/Np5gevF4Nt"
56,@He_lior @AzukiZen Thanks a bunch! Love meeting such amazing ppl in the garden 🙌
57,@He_lior @AzukiZen Thanks! Appreciate the kind words 🙏
58,@ape4007 @AzukiZen Thanks 🙏
59,@Phurinut13 @AzukiZen Thanks 🤗
60,@JuV1789 @AzukiZen Thanks! I love your azuki as well. So serene with the butterflies 😌
61,@Madagraye @SA1NT99 @AzukiZen I'm liking the sound of that 👀
62,@SA1NT99 @Madagraye @AzukiZen Yea seriously. We need an ongoing list of these findings haha
63,@Madagraye @AzukiZen @SA1NT99 Exactly haha. I'll let you know if I find any additional 1/1s tho!
64,"@Madagraye @AzukiZen Hmm that's a tough one, but @SA1NT99's Avatar Azuki is definitely up there. Not so ""hidden"" anymore since he's tweeted about it haha"
65,@Madagraye @AzukiZen Yea I've been discovering new easter eggs even after more than a week of just browsing Azukis. Really is the best collection out there
66,"@chogunna @AzukiZen Exactly, the community is my favorite part about this all. The price is just the cherry on top. Will definitely see you around in the garden :)"
67,@chogunna @AzukiZen Thanks a lot! You have an amazing collection as well and one of my favorite spirits
68,"@KeithLNFT @AzukiZen Nice, that's awesome! Yep definitely see you around :)"
69,"@KeithLNFT @AzukiZen Thanks! Don't worry, I felt the same way about BAYC back when I sold one for too cheap. I've learned there's always new opportunities that present themselves. Keep your head up and !ikz"
70,"@chogunna @AzukiZen Thanks, glad you enjoyed it!"

75,"I've taken the red bean, now will you?

Also, would appreciate it if you guys showed Mr. Azuki or @kentabeanmaster some love!

13/13"
76,"Taking all of these factors into account, this was an obvious bet I had to make on the Azuki team.

This is my ultimate conviction bet on the Azuki team's creativity, their thoughtfulness and their passion for this space.

12/13"
77,"It's obvious that the Azuki team has put in a ton of thought into each decision, from the 1/1 easter eggs in the collection to the red bean references. I have the utmost confidence that they'll continue to do a great job building out the lore and brand.

79,"#3 Conviction in the Azuki Team

I don't think I need to touch on this topic too much since there's already been tons of great threads about why the Azuki team is so awesome, but here's a great thread by @alexhughsam that highlights the thoughtfulness of the team.

10/13"
80,"This again speaks to how detail-oriented the team is and how much thought they put into this collection. It's rare to find a collection where you're constantly finding new discoveries every day.

9/13"
81,"This Azuki would qualify as an unofficial 1/1 due to being the only Azuki with 3 red bean references (offhand, earring, clothing), along with the red background and type.

8/13"
82,"After countless hours of browsing the collection, I noticed that some looked special, but not as highly ranked, such as @ChipNFT's Fire Queen or @SA1NT99's Avatar Azuki.

This led me down a rabbit hole of discovering unique 1/1s throughout the collection.

Examples below:

7/13 https://t.co/A8C7ijXodG"
83,"They're a bit more difficult to locate compared to obvious rares in the collection, like spirits and golds, since you have to filter for the right combinations.

6/13"
84,"#2 Unofficial 1/1s and Rarity

Contrary to most other collections where it may be easy to identify the rarest items by filtering for 1/1s or using a rarity ranking like Rarity Sniffer, Azuki has hidden several ""unofficial"" 1/1s throughout the collection.

5/13"
85,"I believe that we've just scratched the surface for this concept of ""taking the red bean"" and that the Azuki team will continue to incorporate the red bean into future lore and branding.

4/13"
86,"From a more symbolic perspective, as @ZZZAGABOND best put it from yesterday's spaces, ""taking the red bean"" is a reference to the Matrix, but also a reference to the ethos of DeFi, which is community ownership over the platforms you use and constantly pushing the boundaries

3/13"
87,"#1 The Significance of the Red Bean

The red bean is arguably the single most important object in the entire Azuki lore. In terms of the lore, it grants you access to The Garden.

2/13"
88,"I recently picked up my grail Azuki, aka Mr. Azuki, for 110 ETH, my largest @AzukiZen purchase to date.

Here's a short thread on why I believe this smol red bean, amongst the many great beans, may be the single most important Azuki in the entire collection 🧵
