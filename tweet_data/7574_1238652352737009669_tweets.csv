3,@MindFreedom6 Ouch
4,@WHISPERZNFT Don’t scam us - art first - tweet after
5,@TikTokInvestors $10 shorts
6,@strangersxyz Another opinion: imagine a project that has the first tweet as - projects live - buy if you like - this is what the space needs - the opposite of the hype madness we have now
7,@strangersxyz Opinion: give the people who found you early on a higher chance to support your work before all the hype comes

20,@TakeoffTone @HOWLERZNFT So much fud it’s hard to tell what’s a joke or not
21,@Apollo4Teen @HOWLERZNFT I feel like we are there now - .8 is probably close to what it would have cost with gas
22,@PizzaSteve5000 @HOWLERZNFT !awoo
23,@nathanielwise_ @HOWLERZNFT They forget than public sale of 3landers was .75 Dutch and sold out - they complaining cause they thought they could get in cheap - 1 eth is cheap for this
24,@coldgogurt @HOWLERZNFT When the art comes out - itll be fire and 1eth will feel cheap
25,@HOWLERZNFT !awoo
26,"@baggins_fomo @HOWLERZNFT The fud crazy in here - I was prepared to crank the Gwei to 15,000 - these fudders wouldn’t have got one anyways"
27,@baggins_fomo @HOWLERZNFT !awoo
28,@TakeoffTone @HOWLERZNFT You know even if there were no bots that gas war alone would be close to where the floor is now at .8
29,@yourboytwall @nq The allowlist minted egg for .5 I think can 10x but the secondary for 2.0 I think less likely but still possible if game is as fun as I think it will be
30,@Jumpin13060 @ShotChewie @HOWLERZNFT Art gunna be lit tho
31,@ShotChewie @WAGMI_Miyagi @theWinterDojer @ETHETHETH000 @HOWLERZNFT You a big ol degen - congrats 🍾🎉
32,@HOWLERZNFT Imagine not owning a howler NFT and being in a locked discord with the guy who botted the launch - that’s an alpha channel

38,@MindFreedom6 @Sh0ckw4vePuls4r @HOWLERZNFT Sorry I must have been dreaming of a decentralized system - my bad
39,@Sh0ckw4vePuls4r @HOWLERZNFT Just part of the game - make a bot - no handholding here
40,@Sh0ckw4vePuls4r @HOWLERZNFT But isn’t a whitelist essentially a botted launch by default? Grind for months in a discord - no thanks. Raffle whitelist ? Sure but low chance of winning. Either way buying on secondary is typically option
