1,"@SierraLost @HTownRojo @jamieloftusHELP I know you said ""there are too many people"" which tells me you're passionately wrong. My village has 200 people and 10,000 cows. Good and smart people deciding to leave the breeding to the stupid and evil is not a great sacrifice they've made for all of us, it is the opposite."
2,@SierraLost @HTownRojo @jamieloftusHELP You may be now. Lets see how glad you are about it in 30 years. You're not a saint for letting your bloodline die off when we need good people more than ever.
3,@HTownRojo @SierraLost @jamieloftusHELP The biological imperative honed over hundreds of thousands of years is not selfish. Having no kids so you can be a shell of a person projecting feelings onto animals is probably selfish.
