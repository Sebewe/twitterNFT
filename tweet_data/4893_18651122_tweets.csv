45,@LaughAndBelly But in good faith i can’t let you keep using the name I’m sorry
46,"@LaughAndBelly I never received your DM but if this is in regards to your project the Huemans thats so unfortunate as it is literally my artist name for over a decade, I have the name trademarked (for many years) and I am doing a lot in the NFT space. I do appreciate you reaching out"

68,@KMaruve @NFT_ish @AshirasArt Not attacking you—moreso defending her and soo many artists I know that this happens to all the time. There’s a thin line between inspiration and copying. But that’s my own opinion and you be have every right to disagree with it 🤷🏻‍♀️

75,This is why I advocate for established artists to get their asses in the NFT space already — people are plagiarizing their work and many people support them without knowing any better. I’m seeing straight up *tracing* of artists’ work I’ve already seen years ago
