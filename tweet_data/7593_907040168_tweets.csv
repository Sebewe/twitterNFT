0,"3.) Me: “Fuck it, this thing could go to zero. Might as well get some ETH out of it.”  

4.) Convert half to ETH on the Binance chain. Send it to Coinbase wallet which is an ERC wallet. Am dumb. 

5.) Lose all ETH. Total loss about $7.5k."
1,"My crypto fuck up of the year (so far):

1.) Invested about $15k in a DeFi project that I didn’t fully understand. It dropped by 80% in 2 months.

2.) Now I have $3k left and a lottttt of tokens. Feels bad."
2,First of the month and we already have 15 episodes of the New Wave podcast in the can for March. You're welcome or...I'm sorry.
3,"Nobody is as successful as IG would have you think. Nobody is as happy as they'd seem. Everybody is on social media because we are searching for something. If we were truly happy, we probably wouldn't need to consume so much content. This feed is a distraction. But from what?"
4,Bitcoin sentiment is tied to the bigger market. That's bad bc it doesn't hedge inflation as we'd like. Safe to say that's something the crypto community has gotten wrong. Myself included! Crypto has many benefits + the biggest upside potential of all — but it's not invincible.
5,"The New Wave Podcast is officially in 92 countries! Here are the top 10 countries by listeners (excluding US, Canada, UK, Australia...because, duh):

1. Ireland

6,@TomasBeing Umm…wut?
7,Woke up this morning believing in myself and my vision 🌊
8,"Have you ever had a near death experience? If so, I’d like to interview you on my podcast. Leave a comment below and we’ll have the team reach out. Thank you!"
9,The fact that Canada has frozen the personal bank accounts of truckers who are protesting is scary as fuck.  And it proves the need for crypto and DeFi.
10,@thisismarkc That strange feeling of missing a man you never knew.
11,"I was just talking to my wife on the phone and she said, “we can debrief when you come home.” I’ve never been prouder."
12,I fucking hate LA so much. I’m happy to be back 😆
13,"4 things Millennials invented or have normalized in our culture:

1.) Making content as a career via the creator economy. 

2.) Location-independence and/or digital nomadism. 

3.) Instantaneous service: Uber, DoorDash, etc

4.) Cryptocurrency and the metaverse"
14,"Topics we will discuss this year on The New Wave podcast: extraterrestrials, federal regulation / legalization of plant medicines, vax passports, martial arts, firearms, personal finance and crypto. A lot of business strategy. And probably some really good trip stories."
15,"Just added 5 pages of updated information to my New Wave guide on crypto, web3 and the evolution of business/technology. 31 pages in total, it’ll give you the foundation for everything you need to know. Hit the link in my bio to get it for free."
16,"If you want help setting good habits, getting focused in life/biz, and creating a plan for success — do NOT miss The Peak Performance Workshop. Only 100 tickets. Presales open Feb 16.

To get on the early bird list for notifications, DM me ""VIP""  — we will sell out by design."
17,"Performing at your best doesn't always mean working harder. Learn to work smoother. Usually, success in life or business comes down to:

1. Getting brutally honest about what you want.
2. Cutting out any bullshit standing in the way.
3. Working your ass off according to a plan."
18,Black history is in Feb. Women’s history in March. Like damn y’all really trying to get this over with early in the year huh?
19,"Addictions feed the ego. 
Obsessions feed the soul."
20,"Friends and family get invoiced, too. 

How? Repeat after me: “I love you, but I’ve taken years to develop my skills. This work has hard costs and you won’t value the product nearly as much if you don’t have some ‘skin in the game.’ I accept Visa, AmEx, Paypal or Venmo.”"
21,@ashish_fagna @naval @MrBeast Me too!
22,"I hate that everything has become a “lifestyle.” It’s not enough to just drink green juice. You need pictures of you drinking it and they have to be aesthetically perfect, yet completely candid. It’s not about the juice, but what drinking the juice implies about your character."
23,"I am dramatically stepping up the amount of content we are producing on the New Wave podcast and I need your help finding guests. I'm looking for exceptional people doing interesting work in: tech, creative, biz, psychology or psychedelics. Who should I reach out to?"
24,"I never let negative self-talk or impostor syndrome dominate my mind. Whenever it arises, I meet it with an even louder voice that enthusiastically lists all my personal wins, professional accomplishments and future prospects. I ain’t taking shit from anybody. Even myself."
25,"Writing code or creating content are two of the best ways to get leverage in the new economy because they are “permissionless” and they have no marginal costs of replication. 

That means you can multiply your efforts (and your money) with your mind, not your time."
26,I’m considering doing a (free) in-person meetup for New Wave podcast listeners in Los Angeles Thursday Feb 17th. Limited seats tho. Would you be interested in hanging to chat business and life? LMK
27,"My most powerful belief that has led to much success in my life is the following: “I am the exception to the norm.”

You may not think that I am exceptional, but since I believe it, I create new possibilities by shutting down doubt &amp; opening the window to let confidence creep in."
28,@Mr_Decrypto 😆
29,@doncarter_co Right now @cordae. Going through the last 5 years. Listen to the newest album.
30,@Mr_Decrypto It would be surreal
31,"Confession: I think about slavery/racism every day. Not bc I’m angry. Often it’s an observation like: “wow look at all the blk people here. That wouldn’t have happened X years ago.” White ppl don’t have this constant awareness, which is why they are surprised blk people do."
32,"Since you contain the totality of the universe in the fabric of your being, you are also a direct owner. You are a shareholder in an infinite company. It’s a spiritual DAO."
33,"In your creation, the DNA of the Universe is intrinsically encoded. Since the code of the Universe is a hologram, every piece of it contains an undiminished replica of whole."
34,"I’m such a huge goddamn music fan. Whenever I find an artist I like, I go through their entire discography song-by-song and obsess over them like I just found a new food that I can’t get enough of. I’ll be on their Wiki/watching hours of YouTube interviews to understand them."
35,@YouDntKnoMyLife For real!
36,I actively avoid saying “nigga” around my white friends because I don’t want to let them get comfortable saying it around me. But when them niggas leave…
37,"Sitting on a plane all day yesterday. Time to think about life and decisions. Realized that 100% of the negative thoughts/criticisms I have of peers in my industry are reflections of my own internal insecurities. Still some fear, jealousy and impostor syndrome in me. Purge it."
38,"I'm spending the next 3-5 years preparing myself and the family for everything that's changing economically, culturally and spiritually.

There's no downside to being prepared. The #NewWave is coming, whether you like it or not. Better learn how to surf while you still can 🏄🏽‍♂️"

40,"If we do enter into a true depression or even an all out war, the lowest low will likely be short-lived. A few years, tops. It will be how we deal with that period — and the rebound — that makes all the difference."
41,"Things will continue to feel a bit more expensive each year, but significantly more expensive in 5-10.

The cost of goods and services will continue to rise, widening the gap between economic classes and continuing to cut out much of the previously middle class."
42,"It’s entirely possible that the United States may be on the verge of a steep and extended downturn, with many obstacles ahead.

My guess: we’re most likely to experience a gradual but steady ride down the economic ladder in terms of purchasing power of the dollar."
43,"While economists may debate which numbers signify high versus “hyper” inflation, I think these distinctions are irrelevant. 

Imagine the doctor tells you that you have high inflation in your heart, but it’s probably not ""hyper"" inflation. Would you feel comfortable?"
44,Just took a small amount of psilocybin to kick my week off. How you doing?
45,"Mental health tips for the crypto dip: 

#1: don't invest more than you can afford to lose

#2: keep long term focus on the projects you support (tech, team, use case)

#3: Stop looking at ur wallet. Buy what you can of the big ones (BTC, ETH, etc), don't focus as much on trading"

48,"The main thing you need to remember through all this is that the government doesn’t care about your health. They never have. They care exclusively about maintaining power and authority. They are essentially the largest corporation in the country, with a monopoly on violence."
49,"My focus this year is on habits, not outcomes. In 2022, I'm installing and reinforcing the following daily habits:

Meditation, hydration, reading, writing, training, nutrition prep, financial review, content publishing, family time &amp; high-quality sleep.

How about you?"

53,Do you think China will surpass the United States as the world’s biggest superpower in the next 10 years? Why or why not?
54,"FB (Meta) and Square are both becoming blockchain companies. Those tremendous investments of resources and marketing will propel the space forward and prop it up, paving the way for even more mass adoption. This will make the crypto tech much more valuable. Follow the money."
55,"Life isn’t always linear or binary. You can go through a dark period where you feel very down/depressed, while still continuing to move in a generally positive, upward trajectory. Stay focused on the big picture. Don’t be afraid to keep going or start over again if you have to."

61,“Life’s not knights on horseback. It’s a number on a piece of paper. It’s a fight for a knife in the mud.”
62,“Don’t open Pandora’s Box. There’s just more dicks in there.”
63,I hope everyone in Succession dies. I love this show.
64,IG Livestream at 11am PST today. Going to discuss the things you should consider buying during this dip AKA flash sale. #buythedip
65,5.) This is actually a good time to get in if you’ve been sitting on the sidelines. It’s not tolerable for things to keep going up and up indefinitely without dipping. This is still a growing asset class. We need corrections.
66,"4.) The biggest companies in the world are becoming blockchain companies (FB to Meta, Square to Block). The day-to-day is scary but if you believe in the future that these billionaires do, the industry will be fine. Follow the money."
67,"3.) Remember the difference between risk and volatility. What we are seeing now is the extreme volatility of crypto. This is part of the game. That’s why it is a marathon, not a sprint. Where is the capital going long term? Do you see the dollar being a truly safer bet? I don’t."
68,"2.) Most of the big cap stuff is still doing fairly well. Top 10 stuff, all things considered. ETH stayed pretty solid IMO. Let’s not forget it was $500 in January. Don’t freak out about it being $4k (down from $4.7k ATH) now. Crazy gains."
69,"Crypto market is taking a huge correction. A few things to notice: 

1.) BTC hit an ATH last month at $69k. It’s now down in the mid-40’s. This is still up nearly 3X on the year (Jan was $17k). It may dip more. Maintain perspective. What other assets are doing these numbers?"
70,@KaraboMilazi Thanks for listening!
71,@StartupBros @Spotify What do you think? 🥲
72,"Thank you Nipsey Hussle for spending 4,965 minutes with me this year on @Spotify. You are my #1. #SpotifyWrapped https://t.co/KI2e0sZBlw"
73,"Just dropped EP10 of The New Wave Entrepreneur Podcast. It’s a deep dive on my personal experiences with DMT. If you wanna know what it feels like to die and come back in 20 minutes with the complete knowledge of the Universe, check it out. It’s pretty rad."
74,Is Solana a cute name for a girl?
75,@_Trustwalldesks the problem was that none of the payment processors would accept any of my 10 debit or credit cards. This was actually better. Kinda.
76,"You've never felt pain until you've had to send ETH from your MetaMask, to KuCoin, move it from the main wallet to the trading wallet, do a ETH/BTC flip, then a BTC/BNB flip, then send it to trust wallet, convert to BSC, then send back to Meta, all to buy a super early coin."
77,"I tapped a brown belt yesterday and thought, this is stupid. I should just quit. Nobody cares. I’m just gonna get a gun."
78,@JamesJMurray14 appreciate you!
79,I’m about 50 pages into Ray Dalio’s new book and I’m already having a panic attack. An awesome read so far!
80,"Second: the next month of the show is STACKED. We’ll be moving to 3x/week. We have new episodes coming on everything from DMT to NFTs, the metaverse, mental health + peak performance. I’m having so much fun. Thanks for every minute of your time that you give me 🖖🏽"
81,"First: thank you for 4,000 downloads on our first month of The New Wave Entrepreneur. I wasn’t even going to do another podcast because the negative voice in my head said that you didn’t want to hear it. Thank you for proving me wrong. Sometimes I need to be reminded."
82,"That way, you're betting on the future on the industry as a whole, not just one platform you hope wins.

A strong portfolio would have BTC, ETH and 3-5 strong competitors of ETH + some ""small caps"" in an area like gaming.

HODL and take profits when necessary.

You're set."
83,"These are all platforms which can power dapps, NFTs + other projects important to the development of Web3 biz.

Therefore, a strong portfolio would not be maximalist on any specific platform. It would look at ETH, then look at all the strong competitors and bet on ALL of them."
84,"But the ETH platform has issues: slow, expensive in $$ and energy. It will continue to maintain ""first mover"" advantage unless they fuck up royally. But there's so much potential in the market, competitors creep in.

Among them: SOL, AVAX, DOT, ALGO, FTM and many more."
85,"My crypto portfolio strategy / logic:

Web3 means that blockchain technology takes center stage. Just like the growth of social media apps across mobile devices, dapps will become the center of this boom.

ETH is the current leader in this race to build dapps."
86,Crypto isn’t tanking. It’s a Black Friday sale 🌊
87,"The New Wave Workshop is Dec 17-18. We'll cover: blockchain tech, crypto, NFTs, DAOs, the Metaverse and more.

91,"I completely stopped trying to do anything that resembles hustle culture. I take naps in the middle of the day whenever I can and have no problem waking up later in the morning. I'm still getting my work done. If my body says ""rest,"" I'm going to do so. It's smarter than I am."

95,"I’m doing a mass unfollow and I just wanted to put it out there so that there are no hard feelings. I’m happy to share, create &amp; communicate with you via comments / DMs when I can, but my consumption is way too high. The only way to remedy that is to reduce input I’m receiving."
96,"Do you think time travel exists at some point in the future? If so, why don't we see a mass influx of travelers every day coming from the future to visit us in the past (which is our present)?"
97,"There's SO much info to digest. I know. I put together a 26 page ""for dummies"" guide on web3/crypto to get you started. It has articles, essays, videos and podcasts you need to digest. It's a google doc I'll continue to update. Download it free in my bio and surf the New Wave 🌊"
