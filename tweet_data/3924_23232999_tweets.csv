14,"@LooksRareNFT Does this create the same issue OS has been hammered on?  i.e. if an NFT is transferred out and then back into original wallet later on, will the stale price, which may now be much lower than market, be hidden for the seller, allowing someone to snipe it for well below market?"

17,"@mrjosco @farokh exactly. this is a key point. 

not to say someone shouldn't sell because of taxes (better to have taxable gains vs no gains), but tax consequences need to be considered."

42,@cryptoadpunks @BTCBob100k @andreitr @toadpunksbot Maybe a separate bot for only listings?

44,@cryptoadpunks @andreitr @toadpunksbot Glad it’s set up tho seems to be too busy by also showing new listings. Personally prefer that it only shows sales (like all other bots).

58,"@CryptoGodfatha @machibigbrother @BoredApeYC Sure, but Axie hasn't been able to sustain SLP value since everyone is trying to achieve passive income, same as most other NFT projects with tokens. It's very hard to keep sustained value when everyone is trying to cash out."
59,@garyvee Well articulated! Thx for all that you do to educate the masses.
60,@se7enty5ive https://t.co/e71NOm9kxd
61,"@machibigbrother @BoredApeYC Unpopular take: I hope they postpone $APE indefinitely. Tokens make holders salivate at “passive income”. Holders then want to continually cash out = constant sell pressure. Project then gets rekt with declining token value (see Axie/$SLP, Creepz/$LOOMI)."
62,"@jmt_nft Congrats to you and your Mrs JMT! Been there so I feel you. Was a 7 year battle for us (including 3 miscarriages). Ultimately, it was based on God’s timing and we couldn’t have been more thrilled with our 2nd daughter in 2011."

I was trying to figure out how to look for them to see if any have expired but the website (https://t.co/2HCsx5lIIo) has changed. Not sure how to look for them (besides the emblem vault collection on os). Do you happen to know how we can search on the old namecoin site?
72,@flan5412 @skuxxverse @nftworldsNFT @grayboysdao @iamarkdev @Temptranquil Is your pfp a blockhead from namecoin?
73,"@ColinLieb @fcflio I’m starting to think BAYC would be much better off without $ape token. As soon as a token is released, owners see it as “passive income”, however, there needs to be sustained demand for that token. That’s very hard to pull off. See what’s happening to Creepz as an example."

84,"@brycent_ @NFT_Clydesdale As I'm sure you've seen, many projects have run hard over last month w/ a bit of a pullback over last few days.

93,"@_legit_biscuit @olive_livart @BoardApes @W1ll1amEth @opensea @BoredApeYC Ok. Just hoping that this is the safest approach. (Since I’m not seeing posts about the front-running bot issue occurring after the revoke of os permissions &amp; listing cancellations, it seems like this is the best approach.) 

Thx for your input!"
94,"@_legit_biscuit @olive_livart @BoardApes @W1ll1amEth @opensea @BoredApeYC Ok. Some of these technicalities are beyond me but I guess makes sense

So if you don’t revoke os/don’t cancel old listing after transferring NFT to orig wallet w/ old listing, someone can snipe on a site like rarible &amp; when this happens, it’s actually os that makes the transfer?"
95,"@olive_livart @_legit_biscuit @BoardApes @W1ll1amEth @opensea @BoredApeYC If you revoke OS permissions, isn’t the inactive listing still on chain for someone to snipe on other platforms (eg. Rarible, someone’s dapp)?  If so, then even after revoking os, doesn’t the act of cancelling the inactive listing potentially create the front-running bot issue?"
