77,"@mrbettershiller @thebeepos Oh no doubt, I am not fudding this project at all and think it could go on to be successful - my only gripe is the absolute laziness that went into the launch. I'm sick of seeing these ""apologies"" when we are handing them millions of dollars."
78,@TebachETH @thebeepos My lord - this is just absolutely ridiculous. So not even the bandaid fix worked.
79,@thebeepos ALSO your dev may have made the front end mint access set to whitelist holders only but your dev forgot to set publicMint to false. If they had set the mint function to false and presaleMint to true this all could have been averted. Come on people 🙄🙄
80,"@thebeepos Full disclosure - I was not on WL and saw something weird in the contract 5 minutes into launch, to test my theory I minted one from contract, it was successful and proved my hunch was correct. I still hold that one."
81,"Yo what? This is pure laziness, as a web2 dev this sort of bandaid fix CANNOT migrate into web3, we need to be much more diligent than this. Should have delayed the mint, the people who grinded for WL may not have understood at the time but would be much happier today. @thebeepos https://t.co/b9lRr4K3Ek"

87,"If I have to sit and read another long ass apology as to why the contract developers didn't do a thorough enough job I am going to puke. People minting your project are handing over millions of dollars collectively, the least you could do is spend enough time on the contract."
