13,"@ShrewdCharlie @ChampionsP2E Definite panic. 
And I’d also agree with the remainder of your comment."
14,"@ShrewdCharlie @ChampionsP2E They’ve made multiple changes during the drop. Including the decision to reveal all, instead of the planned reveal in March. The number of “off the cuff” decisions had me exit it. 
Admittedly, the art is pretty dang cool."
15,@cb1crypto @3landersNFT Looked at this one for a while. Didn’t see another under 3ETH that came close to its aesthetics. Nice pickup!

The P2E model with scholars is sooo simple with it!
Right now it's RNG. 3D this week. User controlled coming very soon.
Reach out if there are any questions.
@PegaxyOfficial"

75,"@AirWalk_NFT Definitely better than most. 
But, Yeti &gt; Hapes. 
🔥"
76,@WavexPirate I prefer the yeti.
77,@MauriceShalam @HAPEBEASTGANG @super_yeti They are horrible- never understood this one. And you’ve zoomed in on the head. The normal jpeg- the head is so small.
78,"@baue_ I always wonder, what if the Pixel Vault team was running their drops...I can only imagine it would be sooooo much better.
I just don't understand how they continue to underdeliver with their drop mechanics."
79,"@heartbeats_eth @AzukiZen Such good taste!
I need to ape in at some point as well!"

88,@billyshipp @JoesDaily @NiftySlabs @RealSupDucks Haha - I ordered a couple as well!
89,"I have a collector score of 1.3k, and with the bonuses for pack drop - it's usually around 8k (not 10k like the picture shows).

What's the easiest way to boost my collector score so that it does hit 10k?
I only want to collect rares.
Buy RIB? Or another strategy?
