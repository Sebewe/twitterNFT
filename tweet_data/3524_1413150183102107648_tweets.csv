30,Ukraine using Ukraine.eth not only going to bring publicity to ENS Domains but also could bring more trust and less confusion for people that don’t understand crypto! This could be a massive turning point

76,@danielgothits it is kinda nice not hearing a million different complaints a day
77,@12yearoldwithcc without a doubt Elon isn’t close to being the richest man. there’s new money &amp; then there is old money. families that literally pay to keep their names out of the spot light &amp; have been in wealth for generations. visit parts of New England and you’ll see what I mean by old money
