51,"Goals:
A project's goals are specific targets and outcomes the team seeks so it can achieve its mission. The most useful and achievable goals are those that are SMART:

- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Timely"
52,"Values:
Values are guiding principles that direct and prioritise goals. They should support the project's mission by setting guidelines for the team's conduct and the founder's management and leadership philosophy."
53,"Mission:
The mission should capture the fundamental purpose of the project and explains how the project will achieve its vision. A project's mission and vision should complement each other."
54,"Vision:
A project's vision is a guiding concept that contains aspirations. It describes where the project wants to be in the future and offers a set of priorities and ideals."

71,"The argument is that staking rewards are taxpayer-created property and should not be taxed until sold or exchanged. However, a settlement offer from the IRS is not the same as a binding precedent, it’d be interesting to see how it will unfold. https://t.co/21US6DXEF1"
72,"Finally, super fund can be a powerful tool for your wealth generation strategy. If you are considering investing in crypto using your super fund, it is best for you to consult with a qualified professional."
73,"5/5 Costs 
The cost of running an SMSF can be disadvantageous when the assets held within the SMSF are relatively low in value.
But it can be cost-competitive with public offer funds when the asset balance is around $200k; and become cost-effective as the asset balance grows."
74,"4/5 The Fund also needs to prepare and lodge financial statements and tax return each year, and have these audited.  A qualified tax professional can assist you with these compliance and administration requirements."
75,"3/5 This means you need to:
- understand how investment markets work, including both share and crypto markets
- keep record of your investments and transactions
- ensure your fund is adequately diversified to help manage risk."
76,"2/5 The Funds’ investments must also pass the Sole Purpose Test, which ensures that all investments choices are made for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefits to their members."
77,"1/5 Cons - Duties &amp; Responsibilities
As a trustee, you’re responsible for the compliance of your SMSF, including creating and implementing the Fund’s investment strategy — one that will need to deliver enough returns to adequately fund your retirement."
78,"4/4 Having control means trustees can quickly adjust the Fund’s portfolio following market changes, taking advantage of investment opportunities."
79,"3/4 Pros - Flexibility and control compared to normal Super fund

Trustees have ability to invest directly in a wider range of assets classes, and the flexibility to tailor the rules of the SMSF to suit the members specific needs and circumstances."
80,"2/4 And if you are in retirement phase when you sell, all income maybe tax exempt – meaning you will 0% tax on any capital gains (assuming your fund is 100% in retirement phase)."
81,"Pros and Cons 

1/4 Pros - Tax benefits
Income in your SMSF is generally taxed at the concessional rate of 15%, and capital assets held for longer than 12 months at only 10% (after the 1/3 discount) rather than 50% of your marginal tax rate (which could be as high as 47%)"
82,"7/7 and to articulate how investing in crypto assets meets the goals of the members, and that consideration is given to diversification, risk, returns and liquidity – and that these considerations are well documented in the Fund’s investment strategy."
83,"6/7 If SMSF trustees do wish to invest in crypto in their SMSF, there are some important factors that need to be considered in order to meet the ATO’s requirements. It is important to ensure the trust deed allows for investment in cryptocurrency;"
84,5/7 One of the big advantages of SMSFs is the ability for trustees to invest directly in a wider range of asset classes – such as crypto.  They have the flexibility and control to tailor their investment portfolio based on the specific needs and circumstances of the members
85,"4/7 For some, the investment decision making process is made with the help of a financial advisor, however with crypto assets SMSF trustees are on their own - with advisors in Australia typically unable to offer advice on digital assets (at least to retail clients)."
86,"3/7 With #BTC as low as $14k on 13 Sep 20, and $61k on 12 Sep 21 (335% return across 12 months), in this same period, #Eth grew 767%. It’s easy to see the appeal for investors with the appetite for risk. Given the recent dip, investors might find this could be a good entry point"
87,"2/7 The distribution of cryptocurrency assets in SMSF is also biased towards smaller, and one could assume, funds with younger members in accumulation phase: https://t.co/IuyLiDPEHe"
88,"1/7 - Background 
According to the latest ATO statistics report, Australians held approximately $228M in crypto assets as at 30 Sep 2021 in their super fund - only 0.028% of total assets (less than a statistical anomaly)."
