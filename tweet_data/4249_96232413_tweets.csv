8,"The @HardhatHQ plugin system is really neat. The latest pleasant surprise was finding hardhat-etherscan and being able to verify my contract with one command.

Still figuring a lot of this out, and I find it quite difficult. Hardhat makes thins easier."
9,"It's so difficult to find a good @Airbnb with a proper desk and chair for working. With so many digital nomads nowadays, I thought it would be easier. Where are all the great apartments to work from?"

12,"@useWeb3 I've been hacking away on my own, but wish I had more like minded people to shot ideas with."
13,@Haezurath Hey mate!
14,@RescueMe13 Likewise Megan :) Thank you!
15,"@vaynernft @OGAlphaClub I'm so fortunate to be part of this small and closer community. Sharing alpha, and making plays together in NFT space."

18,GM. Waking up at 8:30am today. Jet lag is finally receding? Let's hope so. Have a great week frens!
19,"@Mothers__child @SuhailKakar So true. After over 10 years of developing, I still google a ton of these things in my day to day work. Knowing the answers to these questions by heart does not make you a good software engineer."
20,"@SuhailKakar I really hope one day we stop asking these kinds of questions in interviews, and find more interesting and fun ways to, perhaps even better, estimate if a candidate is suitable for a job."
21,"@bahester Aah yes, this makes sense."
22,"@bahester How did you stop at 3? Once I start eating oreos, I usually don't stop until there are no more oreos around."
23,@0xgp1 @evernote Awesome! I'll check it out. Thank you
24,"@ar2pi_eth @evernote Nice! I've been considering just going to VS Code and markdown, but haven't made the switch. Thanks for sharing!"
25,I've been on @evernote forever. Looking for some new alternatives for taking notes. Any tips?
26,"@steveb_crypto Guilty! I still have lots to explore around DeFi, but NFTs keep pulling me in. It's just too much fun, and everyone I know in crypto space is in NFTs."
27,"Jet lag starting to reside, and I feel I can focus again.

Interesting thoughts on crypto and web3. I especially like the points around ""We're early. Things are complicated. They're expected to break. Everyone is experimenting."" Makes me want to build.

28,"@jillrgunter This is so true. The way to learn in this space is total immersion. Once done, you can compliment with articles, tutorials, etc."
29,"@Kevvy_Tom I have no clue where I'll be in a few months time haha, but probably Europe. Let me know :)"
30,"@Kevvy_Tom Haha! I haven't been in a long time, but it's nice."
31,@Kevvy_Tom Do it! You're in Spain?

75,"@HDDNELF That first item would be tricky, and probably require yet another API call for every single transaction. But including the gas in the price would be simple I think. Should already have that data in the tx.

Thank you for sharing!"

82,"@Jclineshow I fell down the rabbit hole early November last year. My mind was blown 🤯, and I've since then quit my job and completely re-purposed and re-focused my life. I've never been more excited about tech and my career in general. Onwards!"
83,"Holy moly! Just found the video library for an online #web3 conference I had no idea took place a few days ago. I know what I'll be watching tonight!

Thank you @ETHGlobal for making this available.

94,"Another epic day building for #OGAC. Blockchain development and web3 is so addictive.

Today I set up a backend that runs a regular cron job fetching all kinds of interesting OGAC #NFT data, saving it in our own database for faster access. Website update coming soon 🚀 https://t.co/QIv3Y7Vtjz"
95,@OGAlphaClub @catbricksnft Well done #OGAC! 👏 Another community win!
96,@pacopistolas jajaja. Cashing in!
97,@dravine @ReeseW It's interesting how really smart and technical people still get this so wrong. Makes me even more bullish.
98,"@ReeseW It's already happening, and it wont stop at this point. As this space matures and gets easier to use it'll go mainstream. It's just a matter of time."
99,"@RDM_41 Very much so. Oh, and also, congratz on the promotion 🚀"
