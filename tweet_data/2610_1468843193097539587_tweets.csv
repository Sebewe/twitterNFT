3,"Whenever I see “DONT LIST BELOW X ETH!” it reeks of desperation.

The market decides what stuff is worth, for better or worse."
4,"RT @meemosworld: our first holder snapshot has been taken, long-term holders will be rewarded 🌻

9,"@Serdugeth @Frens_For_Life @farokh @Hodlthelines @CryptoMories @opensea I heard somewhere that Wonderpals was first, but Moshi minted before them? 

The creator of Wonderpals Mina is a branding expert and all around awesome operator - I’d be very surprised if she took anyone else’s work…"

11,"@AztecWhaleGod Oh for sure. Real estate is my background as well and I certainly wouldn’t replace it with NFTs.

The closest thing to NFTs at this point is gambling on penny stocks, which you don’t generally do unless you have a stable underlying portfolio 😁"
12,"@AztecWhaleGod 2/2

Imo if you take a value investing mindset, find good communities and don’t over extend yourself NFTs can be awesome.

Yes you’ll get rugged and you’ll take losses, but if you learn from it and don’t make the same mistake twice - you’ll grow as an investor and person."
13,"@AztecWhaleGod Aside from the last point I’d disagree with almost all of the above.

I’ve never had trouble moving NFTs if you pay attention to the market, my risk reward has been great and the ETH they have generated has been leveraged into IRL assets.

26,@nftgirllindy @LegacyAlienNFTs More than fair enough 🙏
27,"@nftgirllindy @LegacyAlienNFTs To offer a counter point - do you think big companies will stop their advertising? Will you not turn up to work?

What is happening is a tragedy, but people still need to feed families etc…"
28,@ATOK_mind @CoolmanUniverse
29,"@itsmechase People instantly flipping stuff for insane profit, with a high chance it then bottoms out and loses a lot of people a lot of money.

Wish you and anyone else the best, but this is the exact kind of mania, bubble stuff that will be used to compare NFTs to beanie babies etc."
30,@SnoweyMM @OttoSuwenNFT FUD or facts from someone who's been in the space long enough to know better?
31,"@itsmechase Absolute insanity. This is the kind of thing that gives the community a terrible name (particularly if it then plummets, which is likely)."
32,"@stonemaceTH @fishyfamNFT Yeah, all in the first few days before the stuff about the art, the busted contract they didn't bother to QC and them fighting with the community on twitter happened.

Pump your bags all you want, but this is not a healthy chart. https://t.co/VvePwro3oA"

59,"A lot of people feeling burnout &amp; losing faith in the NFT space with all these rugs &amp; exploits.

It’s important to remember it’s not all pfps and profit - NFTs can be a force for good.
