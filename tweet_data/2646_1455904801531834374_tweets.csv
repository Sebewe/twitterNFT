20,@ArtSoulShalini All love. Your work is beautiful my friend. 🙏♥️
21,"NFT Community, PLEASE remember to support your peers. I’m loving the investment opportunities we’ve been blessed with, but sometimes it just feels right to procure a beautiful piece and pay respect to the artists. Thank you @ArtSoulShalini for creating Kaleidogyn &amp; Senora Series https://t.co/XYHAawI2Ip"

52,"@NFTsAreNice First thing I look for is if they have Ape # in BIO. I know some don’t post, but so many people taking Apes they don’t own for this it’s bad."
53,@stavianafam @NFTsAreNice You are GMI. Far better investment vs IRL property at this point. Take advantage of this opportunity.
54,"So I did a thing. Fully committing to Bored NYC Events &amp; Entertainment I aped in and sniped THE Hugh Hefner of MAYC/ BAYC. He will be the official spokesAPE and legend behind the brand!!! LFG, feeling super BULLISH

59,@dripbitsnft Thank you 🙏
60,@dripbitsnft I understand completely. Web3 as great as it is is burning a lot of us out and quick. That is the reason I’m focused on bridging the gap between Web3 &amp; IRL as it’s incredibly important to disconnect and take time to be together IRL and get that social aspect in tact. 🙏
61,@CR3ATIV3_type Hey Pinar! Love your pfp. My girl just got one too. I really like them
62,@dripbitsnft gm friend that was beautifully said and could not agree more. Thank you for sharing
