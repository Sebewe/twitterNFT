59,"We long for connexion and a sense of belonging. That's why #web3 is a paradigm shift. People in #NFT feel connected to a community and they belong to a group. No matter where or who they are.

We're not all rich in ETH yet, but the above is quite priceless and a win in my book"

91,"@HumanKindArt @WonderPals Because art is all of us. The young, the old, the freil, the strong. For wanderers and storytellers. For introverts and extroverts and everyone in between.
