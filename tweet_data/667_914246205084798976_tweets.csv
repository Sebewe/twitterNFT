67,"@realjaypelle @nftworldsNFT 2/2 I think if sandbox can live up to their reputation when their full P2E environment is in play, that has the most upside at the moment. Their build tools are amazing but they’re slower to release things so it’ll be interesting to see if that’s a benefit in the long run 🧠"
68,"@realjaypelle Decentraland definitely has the first mover advantage but most people are priced out due to that atm. 

Next best would probably be Sandbox since they’re still relatively low priced compared to DCL and @nftworldsNFT and have a ton of partnerships w/ a AAA team in place."
