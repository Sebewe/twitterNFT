49,@Foobazzler @iamDCinvestor I disagree on this one. But either way there’s a free market. Where somebody like me will sell and never buy again there’s somebody new who will.
50,@iamDCinvestor @Foobazzler Punks have history. They have that. I remember when I first heard about NFTs it was because punks were selling for a lot even back in 2017 they made headlines.
51,"Lmao. Somebody said I had a web2 mindset. Is this crypto twitter’s version of trumptard/libtard

#NFT #NFTs #Crypto https://t.co/PIkdudxeNw"
52,@Foobazzler @iamDCinvestor Who’s talking about stocks? It’s still a brand and the creator’s actions reflect on the assets. If they turned out to be pedos who were chummy with Epstein then pretty sure punk market would dump. This isn’t some collection whos ceators are gone.
53,@iamDCinvestor @Foobazzler Thank god. I don’t think they’ll overtake BAYC. I’m not saying there’s bo market or that it’s dead. Just saying they don’t build community or care to.
54,"@Foobazzler @iamDCinvestor I know quite a few who also sold their punks because of recent events. If you like them, like them. For me, I lost confidence in their future. Market seems to think so too."
55,@1centWhale @rogerballen I feel like Rob Zombie would own one of these.
56,@iamDCinvestor bearish on larva labs in general. Their recent behavior and attitudes made me want to get rid of all LL holdings.  They don't build community. They dont care about community.

80,2. @larvalabs should refund everyone they sold their V1's to. How are you going to sell something to somebody and then try to make it worthless and fud it? You literally gave it VALUE when you entered the sale price on your V1s.
