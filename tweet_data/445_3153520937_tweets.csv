11,@farokh @iwwon_official @CryptoMories @opensea A few thoughts. https://t.co/pHiDdiFEwB
12,And FWIW – I’m not a lawyer but I have studied the situation and stand with @iwwon_official. I know a shakedown when I see it….
13,Join us. Join the “we” movement. We will upend “I” together. Upend evil. Upend destiny. Upend everything and rise higher! We are web3 and we are legion.
14,But we have chosen “we” over “I”. We do not fight because we care about ourselves. None of us have the power to stop the battle axe from falling. But together we are more. Together we are heroes. Together we are a league.
15,There’s a villain in our midst. And the villain wields the letter “I” like a sharpened battle axe. For him there is only “I”. He wants to exist like the letter itself. Every action is for “I” and nothing else. An “I” floating on its own needs. A life connected to nothing but “I”.
16,The speech would sound something like this:
17,"The whole situation feels like a dramatic movie is unfolding in front of our eyes.

I can picture a General standing in front of his/her troops and delivering a truly motivational speech. The energy would be palpable and the masses would feel like they’ve already won."
18,"To be clear, the process still needs time to play out because copyright infringement claims are serious matters and there are governing bodies that will be ultimate arbiter of “right and wrong”. 

But it’s pretty clear where the court of public opinion stands…."
19,"Why would they do this?  The simple answer is that the attack is not just on the CryptoMories project, but also an open assault on the web3 ethos and the community is not going to let this stand without a fight."
20,"The entire NFT community has shown support for the Mories family by buying Mories on the platforms that they’re still listed on and taking to Twitter and other social media platforms to share their kind words.
https://t.co/rZoXssgH8H"
21,"In the words of @iwwon_official (the creative genius behind the Mories project):

“In a space where we pretend to share, support and collaborate, attacking another collection, team, and community this way is in my opinion not only counterproductive, but extremely sad.”"
22,"Someone from the NFT world claimed that one of the Mories traits was a copyright infringement and he asked for an absurd amount of money to go away.
 
DMCA cases need to be taken seriously, and OpenSea did just that with their “act first, ask questions later” delisting action."
23,"The power of the collective in web3 is truly astounding.

This week, @CryptoMories was delisted from OpenSea due to a DMCA takedown request. The project is beloved in the space, and as the facts came out, the community threw their weight behind the Mories family. 🧵👇"

35,"@JohnHenryStyle And in case you didn't get a chance to see it, I wrote a few thoughts on some other aspects of the asset class yesterday: https://t.co/bf6p9p5QdR"
36,"@JohnHenryStyle Yes - Both are true. Professionalization doesn't mean all the money goes to the top. Where I wouldn't want to be is caught in the middle. One day I'll write about this but there's a ""strategic dead zone"" that's quickly emerging in the space."
37,"Yawn. Nothing to see here. Another sign that the VC asset class is professionalizing. 2Xing their fund means LP dry powder is being concentrated in their hands vs. spread across other fund managers.

It's happening at 10+ other funds....I'm just saying.

43,"@zachcoelius @micahjay1 Complex topic. You’re right and wrong. For instance, there will likely be a return to smaller funds chasing non-consensus alpha and bigger firms chasing consensus alpha. 

But it’s not simple to articulate. Worthy of a good 45 min podcast or white paper."
44,It’s great to see two amazing companies work together to deliver value to their customers! https://t.co/6nme8e12xC
45,"@micahjay1 Not necessarily true. There’s a professionalization of the asset class beginning that will put 80%+ of VCs in a strategically disadvantaged box. 

It happened in consulting and I-Banking. It’s happening in VC.

50,"I'm a pragmatic skeptic, but I've been amazed by the all positive power that can be generated by solid NFT communities.

More than once I've watched someone buy their first NFT, join a solid community, participate in Discord conversations, and end up optimistic and energized."
51,RT @Ryan_Falvey: Twitter should create a button that automatically retweets all of Frank’s threads. Just Frank’s though.
52,"@SahilBloom The best investments are non-consensus but turn consensus based on very specific learnings.

If ""one thing"" can turn a non-consensus investment into a consensus then the risk can be massively rewarded once the company is de-risked."
53,The losing strategy during the pandemic was to be a VC firm paying-up for consensus deals because they were losing to Top Tier VCs but felt the need to deploy capital. I wouldn’t want to be an LP in one of these funds because the results will probably make you cry.
54,And great VC firms that looked for non-consensus alpha during the pandemic should also do well. Their “opportunity” was to find investments where their view of value was greater than the consensus perception of value.
55,But Top Tier VC firms that chased consensus investments during the pandemic should do well. The “opportunity” wasn’t generated by pricing deals carefully. It was generated by winning as much “right hand tail alpha” as possible.
56,"For the “pandemic vintage” as a whole, returns are likely to come in worse than the vintages generated in the 2010s. Entry valuations are up as are the probabilities of success. Capital efficiency is good but getting worse. Exit valuations are good but getting worse."
57,"With this framework in mind, the question about whether the “pandemic vintage” will underperform can be diagnosed.

We need to ask and answer the question: 

Is the “Opportunity = Value – Perception” equation stable, improving or declining?"
58,"Impact to early investors: Disciplined investors are paying up for businesses that have reduced odds of failure and truly massive potential outcomes

And investors who are willing to do the work to find fantastic non-consensus opportunities should outperform the market handily."
59,"But non-consensus companies are risky because raising downstream capital can be tricky until they de-risk the business. 

And first time Founders are risky because they don’t have the same access to resources, capital and talent that will follow them to the ends of the Earth."
60,"But if Opportunity = Value – Perception, then the way to produce outsized returns is to find non-consensus opportunities where the odds of success are greater than what the broad investor community believes."
61,"Getting this right is important because paying up for the wrong type of startup can crush returns.

Entry valuations for “consensus” oriented investments have mooned in the past few years. 

And entry valuations for “serial Founders” reflect the belief that “winners win”."
62,Great investors know when to pay up for opportunities that are near-certain winners or opportunities that have outsized “if everything goes right” outcomes. Mediocre investors aren’t as discerning. Poor investors pay up for everything because it’s how they win deals.
63,"ENTRY VALUATIONS

Since the magnitude of right-hand tail outcomes have increased dramatically, it’s logical that entry prices have also increased. But not all startups have the same potential which is where investor skill and insight come into play."
64,"Late-stage multiples

Early investors benefit from cheap downstream capital. Multiples have been high (cheap capital) but there are signs that this is changing as we speak given public market comps.

Impact to early investors: Positive relative to historical norms but changing"
65,"Talent war

The available talent pool hasn’t kept pace with the Cambrian explosion of well-funded startups. Hiring and retaining talent dilutes investor returns because it consumes cash and equity.

Impact to early investors: Negative"
66,"Startup tools

It’s easier than ever to leverage existing infrastructure players to launch functionality. The impact is profound because most tech heavy startups live and die by how quickly they can ship code

Impact to early investors: Positive"
67,"CAPITAL EFFICIENCY

There are many forces at play that impact how capital efficient a startup is. Generic trends can be examined, but dilution is more a function of “business model specific forces” than the other drivers.

With this said, a few macro forces at work include:"
68,"Public investors have internalized how good well-run tech companies can be relative to the incumbents they’re attacking.

Even with the recent correction in the public markets, exit valuations are very healthy from a historical standpoint.

Impact to early investors: Positive"
69,"EXIT VALUATION

VC backed companies are staying private longer than they did in the past which means that more enterprise value is accruing in the private markets.

The best are staying private long enough to “price” at multi, deca and even centi-billion dollar valuations."
70,"What is true is that shipping code on time and budget is easier than it’s been in the past.

What is true is that there are established “go to market” strategies that can help scale startups faster and with more certainty than in the past.

Impact to early investors: Positive"
71,"What is true is that launching a startup is easier and less expensive than it’s been in the past.

What is true is that capital availability has given startups more time to crack the code on their businesses than they’ve had in the past."
72,"PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS

Startups aren’t uniform beasts. Unseating an incumbent or creating a market the world hasn’t seen before isn’t easy, but the reality is that some spaces are easier to disrupt than others. Startups chances of success span the entire risk spectrum."
73,"An oversimplified value formula: 

Return = (Exit Valuation/Entry Valuation - Dilution From New Shares Issued For Employees and Investors Between the Entry and Exit Period) * (Probability of Success)

So what do we know about how the key drivers are changing?"
74,"The next step is to lay out the main drivers of returns and how they’re changing.

A simple framework that I like to use collapses the drivers into four major categories:

Entry valuation, Capital Efficiency, Exit Valuation and Probability of Success"
75,"Individual investments will follow their own paths but a “vintage” will succumb to the forces of the mega-trends.

And because “Opportunity = Value – Perception”, top quartile managers will always outperform the “vintage” definitionally."
76,"So when answering the question: “How will a vintage of investments perform”, a good place to start is to examine the key drivers of return and how they’re moving.

10-year VC returns have been fantastic so another 10-year period of similar performance would be welcomed!"
77,"Buying one lottery ticket with your own money can be fun but assembling an investment portfolio with other people’s money is different.

It kind-of-sort-of feels like you should know what the risk/return profile is of your investments. Your LPs probably care about this."
78,"Only looking at a theoretical exit valuation is the equivalent to buying a lottery ticket without understanding the odds of winning. 

Many factors influence returns including a variety of exogenous factors. “Returns math” isn’t based on set-it-and-forget-it formulas."
79,"If you want to be a top decile investor, it’s important to do the work to understand the potential return of any investment. And potential returns aren’t only a function of the “exit valuation in a success scenario”."
80,"Observation #4:

Buying a winning lottery ticket isn’t the same as being a great investor. Both produce fantastic economic returns but only one is repeatable.

Repeatability requires skill and discipline. Repeatability requires feedback and learning. Repeatability requires work."
81,"Observation #3:

The power law is used to justify lofty valuations. “You can’t pay too much for the best companies” is mostly true.

It’s also true that building a portfolio made exclusively of “best companies” is a fantasy because they’re difficult to spot before they break out."
82,This isn’t a new phenomenon. The “power law” can be trusted as a fundamental force of the universe with the same level of certainty that every morning the sun will rise in the East and every evening it will set in the West.
83,"Observation #2:

Even with the correction in the public markets, the best VC backed companies have produced amazing outcomes for early stage Investors. Any early stage Investor who found at least one “right hand tail company” returned their fund many times over."
84,"This leads to a critical VC truism that’s often overlooked:

Opportunity = Value – Perception

If every investor saw every investment opportunity the same way then returns would collapse to the risk adjusted cost of capital. There wouldn’t be “top quartile” managers anymore."
85,"Investor interest varies because each investor evaluates the risk/return profile using its own methods.

Consensus startups attract capital at higher prices than non-consensus startups because the investor community believes these startups will succeed with high probability."
86,"Observation #1:

VC returns are driven by investing in companies that aren’t fully de-risked that ultimately succeed because the risks never materialize.

A lot of things can skink a startup, but the best dodge bullets, avoid landmines and ultimately create enterprise value."
87,"People are curious how the “pandemic vintage” of startups is going to perform. 

Are returns going to collapse because entry points are 3-5X what they were years ago?

Will the public markets correction crush returns?
