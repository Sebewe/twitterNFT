3,@TheDrMAWZ 👀 noted. @TheDrMAWZ just a heads up to you and crew - gonna take a break from twitter. Focus on my mental health and the work. 🙏🏻 so I won’t be checking my DMs or @‘s
4,@diorginyard His iPad is more legit than my laptop
5,@xbox360nft Not weaponizing mental health. I take that very seriously. We haven’t performed well. I’m working on it. We are working on it. I’m very serious about mental health. I can take the backlash about performance.

9,@topshotmoments @hellodapper 2/2 Hell or high water we will get there. Love to you all. If you’re at the highest high or lowest low right now - we struggle together. And with that I shall sign off to finish up work and then go be a mom
10,@topshotmoments @hellodapper 1/2 Everyone is amazing. &amp; the ones hurting right now - this is what drives me to work even harder. Growth is supposed to support &amp; contribute to a thriving community &amp; economy. We haven’t done that well the last few months and we are doing things differently going forward.
11,@Grand_Ma_Ma_ @nbatopshot @WolfPackWW Ha should I?! Not if I’m gonna get skewered - my heart can’t take anymore today. Let me build up my strength
12,@birdPersonNFTs @xbox360nft @AG_NBA_ @nbatopshot I can absolutely see how it can be taken that way. That’s totally fair
13,@mbl267_NFT @wholesomename @nbatopshot And I’m serious too. DM me and we’ll set it up. Ill ship you one
14,@xbox360nft @birdPersonNFTs @AG_NBA_ @nbatopshot Ya pretty much. I’ve been at my desk 14hrs a day. I needed to sit somewhere and really think about the problems to solve and how. I don’t know if we are gonna see eye on eye on this so all I can say is im sorry I offended you. Working really hard. I will show you w the results
15,@birdPersonNFTs @xbox360nft @AG_NBA_ @nbatopshot I guess I don’t see it that way. Cigars represent the only time I was able to hang out w my dad. My dad worked a lot on weekends and he would smoke a cigar on the patio. So when I smoke one. I think of him and remember to try to make him proud. I got into it to hang out with him
16,"Also - if anyone wants to do a virtual cigar chat to tell me:
1. How shitty I am
2. Your ideas for TS
3. Having a hard mental health period in your life and want to hug it out

DMs are open. I’ll send you one. We smoke and chat. https://t.co/6VV4GOXfLT"
17,@wholesomename @nbatopshot I’m being really no bullshit when I say this - can I send you a cigar and we can do a virtual cigar chat?
18,@retroblockchain @nbatopshot The Y’s are best 😆
19,@xbox360nft @AG_NBA_ @nbatopshot Oh I’m not the poster child for the brand. I’m a lame mom. There’s way better people who are driving the brand. Thanks for calling me on my shit. I’ll be more sensitive next time. I know it’s been a hard month. I don’t want more. It’s impacting everyone on diff levels. ❤️
20,@xbox360nft @AG_NBA_ @nbatopshot You’re right. I didn’t mean it that way. I tried to say “I am working on growth and marketing for TopShot”. Not trying to project wealth of any kind. I work really hard and am proud of what I’ve accomplished in my career and wish nothing but the same for anyone. I’m truly sorry.
21,"@xbox360nft @AG_NBA_ @nbatopshot Absolutely. Everyone is having a hard week. I know I’m nothing special. Just trying to take care of myself and be a good mom, wife, and worker. I hope you have a great weekend and I will do my best to try to keep your weeks from being hard going forward ❤️"

25,@BermanatorNFT @nbatopshot Wouldn’t day chillin. Having a cigar before I have all three of my kids by myself for the weekend. I also get a lot of ideas smoking a cigar. It helps w my anxiety.

30,@jonboybeats @TheDrMAWZ Hi from my backyard. Ya that’s a fair point. A missing piece - when we put out our POVs and roadmaps to have Econ &amp; marketing strategies together so it gives more context for you and also keep calling me out on my shit. My wife just said I look like an asshole w these sunglasses https://t.co/7nIhE6tTzA
31,@jonboybeats https://t.co/3K19vYy8Zp
32,@jonboybeats Not holding back on marketing. If you want the context @jonboybeats - I said it’s not a good time to do new user acq at the end of seasons and went into the CAC implications of why. Not that we won’t grow or have any. But we will focus a lot of efforts at beginning of seasons.
