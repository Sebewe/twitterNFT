1,@DheerajShah_ I gotta see what a $3 haircut looks like 😂
2,@LumberJackBoars Fancy bears
3,Shilling my fancy bears bag hard today. I paper handed creepz so I’m fucking holding this one.
4,@MRMILLI0NAIRE Get you some $honey bro under 1 eth atm @FancyBearsMeta
5,@LordOfTheBAYC @BartekSibiga @FancyBearsMeta Not yet but I definitely will be. Floor price seems insanely low right now if honey can stick at .01
6,@AlienBoyGlowBro Man that’s tough. But I always value simplicity so I’d take the right.
7,.@FancyBearsMeta https://t.co/J2O4GFfeKn
8,People on here acting like genius traders for tweeting to sell IF above 10 eth. Fuck man you really went out on a limb there no one else had that info.
9,@jaybirdNFT GM #GangGang
10,GM. Big weeks coming in this space. $gang $ape $honey pack your bags accordingly
11,So this is the first time opensea has locked one of my items. Are they just gonna hold it hostage forever or do they give it back. They’ve already fucked me on the flip the floor doubled and is no closing in on zero.
12,Well this is the top https://t.co/2DCw7cJubb
13,It sucks to see some of the people you followed early on in this space who were “for the people” turn into shill artist that pump and dump everything. If NFTs die it’s because every newcomer got fucking scammed.
14,Fancy Bears basically paying for themselves with $honey in the next couple weeks DYOR
15,That mutant floor had some fight in it after all.
16,RT @BAYC2745: PRO TIP: Asking a whale or someone specific to ‘buy your NFT for XETH’ or ‘sweep the floor’ has a 95% chance of making them N…
17,@MikeBou50116376 8 am. Just waiting for the impending crash ser
18,So are we still gmi or..
19,@DocMundi @NORML I live in the south these guys are all pure entertainment. In my state instead of getting the tax dollars we desperately need we just let everyone drive 10 minutes across the state line to gamble and buy weed.
20,When people start getting up today it’s gonna be a fucking blood bath. In all seriousness if you think you’re gonna need some irl liquidity anytime soon get what you can. Be smart be safe.
21,Fuck man even $ape can’t save us now
22,Really liking what I’m seeing from this project. https://t.co/ZtRUIq1ibF
23,Is worlds gonna flip mutants. https://t.co/cMvivoCDSE
24,@Cj_does_crypto @skuxxverse @nftworldsNFT Thanks I’ll check it out
25,Man wrld may single handedly start the next bull run. I sadly own 0
26,X2Y2be like https://t.co/YIfRaTjZQH
27,Does the amount of mints and items pixel vault has dilute the brand or make it more desirable
28,@the_x2y2 https://t.co/MP0LsDn1KG
29,Worst “airdrop” ever https://t.co/dB34CzSfoQ
30,If rewards tokens are based on the amount you spent on opensea isn’t using opensea rewarding us?
31,@andr3wtl @GutterCatGang @KeepinItGutta https://t.co/kjWk5ksLvd
32,Never been much of a cat person but wasn’t passing on this dapper dog #GangGang https://t.co/8lvMPRrZvK
33,Never seen this before. Anyone? https://t.co/ITs4FP2hKF
34,If I didn’t buy a cool pet fucking milk would be $8 and the game would be rolling. Instead I have no milk and the floors just tanking 👍🏻
35,@beaniemaxi https://t.co/2vThb6pYyj
36,@halina_eth None just comparing current floor prices.
37,@food_pyramid Yes and no half we’re minted. But still 20k of the 30k total membership tokens are a quarter million cheaper than the other 10k.
38,Apes offering 250k dollars more utility than mutants??
39,Did X2Y2 legit build a marketplace that couldn’t even get through its own airdrop without going down.
40,@griillz_eth @TeamBloot @beaniemaxi https://t.co/cRtdSwBSR8
41,@Gee__Gazza I see no one’s updated you in almost an hour. I got you bro. Thirty seven
42,I want a kick ass cannabis P2E so badly.
43,https://t.co/tY84DRe0Ry
44,You playing on Twitter too much somebody gonna be airdropping some dick to your bitch.
45,Did anyone actually get any milk today
46,@daniel100eth If he’s getting $1500 I’ll just plan on never claiming.
47,@RegularRuben https://t.co/9OIkoTvOlr
48,@jpegplug I’d like to tell you all I learned my lesson and keep some liquidity so this will never happen again. But I’m a fucking degen so I have .03 to my name. Don’t be like me always keep some eth on deck for stealth drops.
49,@jpegplug Most painful moment of my life. I was right there saw the alert early right place right time. Didn’t have the eth to mint 1.
50,@mugatu_eth https://t.co/I3PKxe4GnM
51,I’m really starting to question is it coinbase that’s out of touch with the nft world or is it me??
52,@MRMILLI0NAIRE https://t.co/Sui6ixWz2b
53,That $3.60 going to $4.20 by morning. Fuck your 9-5.
54,Quick undercut everyone before it’s too late. https://t.co/xVY7pcqcvs
55,@0xSkaggnetti @MetaHero_ @pixelvault_ How much you earn a month with current staking rewards?
56,"Simpleton here 👋🏻. Would this open the price of $milk at 300,000 milk equal to 1 ETH ? https://t.co/l3ojAlmSDI"
57,Anybody getting that free kong club mint?
58,https://t.co/kMHNChkABw
59,RT @GoTrillaGorilla: Everyone send eth to that address
60,COINBASE
61,@MRMILLI0NAIRE I’m glad you said that I keep seeing posts about investing big in one project is how you’re gonna get generational wealth. People are gonna get rekt.
62,Mutants out here looking like a clearance special 18.99
63,@TheShamdoo https://t.co/NAItpDHNyI
64,My start into NFTs. What was yours?

67,@BoredAxis @LooksRareNFT https://t.co/cBsyiTJNvy
68,Is there any legit sites to help learn smart contracts. Most of them look like an absolute scam the way they’re advertised.
69,@elevatedape1458 @BoredApeYC I’m holding out even though it’s been hard too. People are starting to say $ape is priced in but any widely known project I’ve seen pumps on actual release even if utility was widely known beforehand. The potential for staking could equal a massively different payout than today.

74,@FQLT_ @fishyfamNFT I saw two posts back to back posting the exact same shill worldly slightly different and knew it was gonna shit the bed.
75,@MikeBou50116376 Left all day
76,@nogoodlogan @MetaJoey Yeah ever heard of a Ponzi scheme? Basically same thing.
77,@nogoodlogan Nah don’t do it I heard they’re a scam
78,@mooncat2878 @MetaHero_ @NFTprophet https://t.co/W5PnKzAFeq
79,Some of y’all dick ride too hard. They could send out an ape keychain and I swear somebody would have a 12 page thread about how great it is and that it’s possibly the key to the city of Atlantis. It’s ok to be happy and excited but it’s also ok to be critical and down to earth.
80,Cool pets reminds me of having a tamagotchi pet and I’m fucking pumped. Surprised to see so many negative post lately.
81,Come on guys let’s not go down the political and religious road. All of these things are starting to divide us. If WAGMI we gotta make it together.
82,"What’s the absolute best tool you guys have found to research NFTs (rarity, price, sales, listings, etc) ??"
83,@BoredAxis @nogoodlogan https://t.co/q86eXfvVyA
84,Why y’all wallet watching so hard
85,@wenmilk_eth Bro you wait a whole day ngmi. 10x in 30 minutes or dump that shit.
86,This how dudes picture themselves saying “(insert blue chip project) holder here” in a new projects discord. https://t.co/61mRFWY4wE
87,@rube_zilla Top right is speaking to me
88,@GoTrillaGorilla Fuck it’s Andy Milonakis
89,@rexwub Nah. They never buy shit just sit around posting I’m gonna sweep the floor with the 1 they have in their wallet hoping to make .03
90,Bro half of western Kentucky running around with meth mouth and they out here arresting folks for half a gram of weed.
91,Instead of everyone posting “sell before reveal” why do we all just say fuck you to non instant reveal mints.

93,"RT @OGDfarmer: Two things that do my head in and keep popping every time I log into this godforsaken platform: 

“Who’s still staking $LOOK…"
94,How many bullshit staking tokens we gonna make this month
95,First time ever minting a rare and it was a 1/1. Rugged. Fuck me can’t win for losing
96,@studioventures @Ape2047 https://t.co/SqcoD3qwcD
