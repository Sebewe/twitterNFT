8,"When a project is subject to too much flipping, community is almost impossible because the only commonality is financial upside, which has nothing to do w that specific project and they aren’t around long enough to have multiple touch points, let alone contribute to the community"
9,Community is the (1) Commonality of Purpose meets (2) Frequency of Touch. You have to believe in the same thing and interact with the community often enough to feel included with the likeminded tribe.

27,"All my homies are my neighbors, regardless of where their land is, and their frens are their neighbors, and so forth. So you would actually want to walk house to house, bc you know you’re in this infinite daisy chain of dope amazing peeps. That’s the world I want to live in."
28,"Wouldn’t it be cool if metaverse land wasn’t bound by physical borders, but instead by infinite ones in multiple dimensions, so you could share fences with endless frens? Or what if neighbors weren’t defined by location but instead degrees of separation?"
29,"Experiences and community are what makes a destination worthwhile - what you do and who you do it with. The joy and the memories. As you build in the metaverse, think what and who and why, not just where. And the pipes connecting these magical worlds, not siloing them."
30,"If @BoredApeYC had a party on the edge of town, would it be too far for your avatar? I’d @JaduHologram hoverboard over. If you couldn’t get into said party &amp; the land around it was bought by an evil corporation, would you settle for the company picnic, just bc it’s next door?"
31,"Maybe the first few times your avatar goes in, you walk around &amp; explore. But that gets old (and inefficient) fast. When you want to go somewhere, you will likely just 1-click your way there, just like we navigate web 2. Why would you spend hours walking your avatar across town?"
32,"I just spoke at Eth Denver about the future of NFTs. I ventured a contrarian viewpoint: that location *does not matter* in the metaverse, so don’t pay that premium to be near cool. It got some pushback."
