13,"A cool integration, but rarity can also sometimes be a double edged sword for new folks. Make sure to compare relative traits to see how a community values it.  Rare + aesthetic vs rare for the sake of it. https://t.co/tD4CBjfiag"

We're in this together and every little bit of support counts. #Ukraine"
80,"In times of crisis it can be easy to become overwhelmed. Thankfully, it can also bring out the best in humanity. 

A German friend traveled 13 hours to the boarder of Poland &amp; Ukraine in hopes of helping his friends escape his war torn country. His friends weren't able to leave."
