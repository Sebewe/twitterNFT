1. Ensure every investment has homerun potential
2. Cultivate a short memory and remember that bets going to 0 is just part of the game. 

Hope that is helpful!"
13,"VC in a nutshell: hit home runs or don’t play the game. 

Crypto is not very different. It just moves faster. 

In fact, Multicoin’s historic performance has really been driven by a select few homeruns (Solana, Helium)."

Higher-quality at-bats is more complex.

There are two strategies to accomplish this:

1. Be defensive when the market is hot
2. Be aggressive when the market is cold.

In Buffet terminology: ""be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."""
36,"When the market is hot (like today), investors:
- Become risk tolerant 
- Demand lower risk premiums (buy at higher prices).

When the market is cold (like post-2008), investors:
- Become risk adverse 
- Demand higher risk premiums (buy at lower prices)."
37,"Attitudes toward risk can be captured by the Capital Market Line (CML).

- In good times, the curve gets flatter
- In bad times, the curve gets steeper. https://t.co/VJcEVVfBUi"
