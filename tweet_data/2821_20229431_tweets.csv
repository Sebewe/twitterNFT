If you never touched your $1M and got a conservative 4% return on it, that's $3,333 per month. After paying rent, taxes, expenses, healthcare, there won't be much left behind to follow your purpose."

21,"@scott_lew_is @lemiscate Real estate is not bad as passive income. Think 6% annual ROI on rent alone + ROI on long term asset appreciation. Beats lending out stablecoins in DeFi.

84,@mayazi It takes far longer than a month to prove/disprove technological narratives.
85,@a17jain @defiprime @PancakeSwap What happens if a certain government orders BSC shut down? Is it decentralized enough to carry on functioning and securing the billions locked in or can it be switched off wiping out all the assets with it?
