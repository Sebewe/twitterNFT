1,"@terra_punk @RareSplinter @nirkouris @doodles @poopie @evankeast @burnttoast I don't think any of us alien owners are going to complain lol, I mean they're all perfect.  As are most throughout the collection.  Two other aliens have launched too (can't wait to see Blackapple's pink alien soon):

2,"@JPEG_Simp @Crypto_Matters_ @TheArtfulRodger @unnamed_owl @doodles @BoredApeYC I feel this added long-term value to all Doodles.  Rarer ships just added greater value.  I have 1 of 62 custom/hand-drawn Doods &amp; we all got VERY special Space Doods.  My mid-rare devil got a non-rare ship but I don’t feel cheated (although I minted mine, so just my own take)."
3,"Holo Space Doodlien.  Thank-you so much @burnttoast, @alfiemotion &amp; @varounsvlogs (+@doodles founders/team), I love it!!  The attention to detail... holo colours moving around head/body... everything... wow.  You have NAILED this entire Space Doodles thing &amp; created NFT history. https://t.co/cR08KjCJgh"
4,"@Necronomicz @doodles Apparently one has been sold back to the original owner at cost, at 2 eth profit.

I'm an overly-empathetic person although in this specific situation - people need to step back and wait if they don't know what they're doing.  Not dive in head-first without thinking."
5,@Necronomicz @doodles Yep.  People that didn’t read any of the instructions.  And ignored the very clear warning at the point of wrapping.  smh. 🤦🏼‍♂️
6,Space Doodles are filling Crypto Twitter (and my heart) with pure joy.  Haven’t sent my own Doods to Space just yet… @doodles
7,"RT @kduck_nft: Squad is ready for takeoff 🚀🌈
@doodles https://t.co/U23idrroIG"
8,"gm.  2.30am &amp; can't sleep.  Too excited for Space Doodles today.  For safety, please keep your arms inside your spaceship at all times.  Doodlers: be wary of fake wrapping sites - take your time &amp; check.  Non-owners: there is no ""mint"" whatsoever - ignore the many scams. @doodles https://t.co/phODdLzUol"
9,@metazord_eth @doodle7270 @totoheads @Beutrec @shan1024m @EiblSebastian @0xwinky I can't wait for your Doodle's NippleShip.  I'm sure Poopie organised that for you.
10,"@metazord_eth @doodle7270 @totoheads @Beutrec @shan1024m @EiblSebastian @0xwinky I was just thinking that's a bellybutton, not a mouth."
11,@davieselke27 @doodles Welcome to the fam!
12,"@evankeast @boudinodejong @doodles For some Doodles, it's a trip home to visit family and a much-needed break from their mission."

18,@JatzNFT @doodles Welcome to the Doodles fam.
19,"@FlashNTC @doodles Welcome, saw you searching hard in Discord for the right one.  Worth the effort, that's a Dood that brings lots of joy."

26,"@fallenflowerLLC @0xMatx @doodles You're right, it's almost like having a time machine that lets you go back 4-5 months and be on Doodles WL."
27,"@0xMatx @doodles Possibly people selling Invisible Friends at incredibly high pre-reveal prices, and realising they could immediately pick up a Blue Chip with the exact same amount of eth they just received."
28,"@alexarnault @doodles Welcome, and fantastic choice! https://t.co/UCSU7kwC5R"
29,Frustrating how Twitter-verified profiles with fake Doodles minting scams still aren't removed after many days of reports.  The @pixel_esports scammer has had many victims so everyone pls take a moment to report that profile.  @verified @TwitterSupport REAL Doodles is: @doodles https://t.co/VkIGYZGJT1
30,@thebrandtp @doodles @evankeast @poopie @burnttoast I used all my mint luck in one go lol.  The RNG Gods are generous.  The fact it happened on my biggest conviction NFT project was extra amazing.
31,@thebrandtp @doodles @evankeast @poopie @burnttoast Minted all except the mohawk punk
32,@cryptokid_btc @doodles @byburnttoast HMU in Discord or DMs with anything I might be able to answer. 🙂
33,@malibugoes Certainly.  Do you want the background image or just the logo?  Downloading/uploading will cause Twitter to reduce quality further so contact me on Discord if you want (where I can send the original quality versions via DMs) - Guy Incognito#5922
34,@qrakeneth @doodles @evankeast @poopie @burnttoast Y'know I've had the exact same thought.
35,Completely and utterly unofficial logo.  My Doods apologise for the flaws. https://t.co/qjZzcyfL3m
36,"Asked my own 5 @doodles about the •_• vs ._. debate.  They said the founders use ._. while the Doodles Twitter account uses •_• &amp; shrugged their Dood shoulders.  Then (poorly) made their own fan logo.  Don't @ me if in the ._   . camp, go with whatever you vibe with! https://t.co/dzlXqk3I4G"

42,"RT @thekinggully: Guys this is not me. Losing 300E+ is devastating but I wouldn’t ask anyone for ETH.

My only discord ID is TheKingGully#1…"
43,@etherneteric @doodles I have an irl fren who isn't even in crypto that asked for one of the shirts.
44,@nftnoobie You just need to think of the prices in eth.  Some items are a failed mint gas fee.
45,@jpegrich @doodles Oh damn these just write themselves.  Destiny.

52,"My Doodlien asked why its species wasn't in the first @doodles merch release, so I had to make this &amp; pretend it's real (no-one tell Doodlien the truth, please 🛸🔫😬).

55,@NateAlexNFT Pretty sure you're walking into a Squid Game situation here.
56,@doodle2691 @CoolmanUniverse @ryanis___ @doodles @SquishiverseNFT Pretty crazy of them to mess with someone who goes by the name Bandit.  And one reason I have my Discord handle/# in my Twitter/OS bios is that I’ve been impersonated before too.  Although non-standard characters still a risk.
57,@0xbester @doodles Welcome dood!
58,@opensea_support How on earth could you roll out the new contract knowing this?
59,"Wow.  BrokenSea rolled out their new contract knowing Trezor users can't list or offer.  It's almost like they're making a conscious effort to destroy themselves.  So we're being punished for having basic wallet security?  Go home @opensea, you're drunk. https://t.co/w6fo7Tr8yw"
60,"@RyRoTaco They upgraded to a new selling contract today so prob something to do with that.  Personally, I'll wait to see that the contract works properly for everyone else before trying to list through it!"
61,@STR0 What a collection!  Nice to see you're part of the @doodles fam already 🤍 https://t.co/GnsVrPXFno
62,@BlackAppleArt @burnttoast @doodles Definitely!  So rare these days to get anything top-tier before people realise it exists.
63,"Aped into a 2k edition @burnttoast (artist behind @doodles) ""gm"" Cameo Pass artwork 😍.  Ridiculously cute &amp; looks great next to the alien in my @doodles vault (https://t.co/Qc0FDwCgEo) - with not-yet-burnt toast bouncing up &amp; down!

68,"Future Space Doodles, please don't use the Doodlien's transporter.  Instead, await your spaceships.  Something has gone wrong &amp; I have no idea how to undo this mess.  Do I just try sending them back together the other way?  @doodles https://t.co/3nDdmZbmRv"
