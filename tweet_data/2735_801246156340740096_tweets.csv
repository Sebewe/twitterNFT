14,are there any tools/methods for easily matching contract variables to storage slots? 🤔
15,"@VirtualElena going to be a HUGE issue with web3 games.  what events are put on-chain could end up really hurting a team in the future, both in mechanics (immutability) and UI flexibility (data issues). @darkforest_eth  is a really amazing case study of good balancing of both sides of things"
16,"@VirtualElena basically enhanced UX + L2 data processing = jumping into the jetstream day 1!

For example, why don't NFT mints (like artblocks) show competitive bidding during the mint process? all the data is available in the mempool. 

it's a data headache, not a design/product one"

22,"@MSilb7 that's interesting. would be dope to have a thread sometime on the batcher and how it chooses when to batch! I think I've read some high-level docs on it, but seeing the data in action is always helpful."
23,"@MSilb7 dope visuals. it'd be cool if there was a way to ""schedule"" your transaction for a busier batch the same way you just set a lower gas price on L1."

32,@fullyallocated @symmtry69 Yeah! That's what I said in response to Brian's reply too
33,"@joey_debruin @fullyallocated Oooh great point! Yeah I think platforms should be data opt-in, almost like @useGALLERY style for NFT collections.

Passive models (i.e. inclusion of data w/o user say) makes more sense for community-wide model benchmarking rather than interpretations at the individual level"
34,"@joey_debruin @fullyallocated Right. Yeah there's probably some happy medium between the illusion of ""any contributor is a good contributor"" and the extremes of dot collector systems at Bridgewater. 

I'm kind of working through an education based leveling system, so maybe we can debate on that example later!"
35,"@joey_debruin @fullyallocated Exactly, so if the community is taking the risk then the penalty should fall on the applicant/contributor for the most part. Like if a bounty is unfinished, or a proposal has a negative effect. 

These are all good questions, maybe we need to run a Twitter spaces on this lol"
36,"@Flynnjamm @fullyallocated The benchmark continues to shift at a different rate, so in effect you've ""lost"" levels."
37,"@Flynnjamm @fullyallocated I mean depends on the design around. Say you're either moving up or down levels, that doesn't have to mean your access/status has to move with it. 

Also could design it as a level inflation system, which makes sense for something domain specific. So your level goes up only but"
38,"@symmtry69 @fullyallocated Token heuristics are too strong for both designers and users, I think negative implies ""removed"" from a wallet. versus ""temporary/natural loss"" the way video game SR ranking is interpreted. 

So the mechanisms and marketing around it starts off inherently biased to positive only"
39,@fullyallocated 100%. I think twitch polls/bets are a fun example to build off of as well. Like you could enhance all these forum policy discussions so much with pos/neg gamification
40,@fullyallocated Most (all?) are missing some element of risk taking. Bearish on positive only reputation systems

77,"None of this would be possible without all the great data heads in web3:

there are many more I'm missing, but I appreciate all of you! 🙏"
78,"On teams, I cover three of the skill pillars I've seen most prominently in the space. I plan on making this prettier and coming out with content/cohorts across these pillars later on this year - but there should be enough material in this section to get anyone started! https://t.co/utdvZXhI2q"
79,"On tools, I cover the web3 data stack, when to use each sub-category, and key communities to get involved in (with people to contact). 

If you've used most of these and are collaborating in some of the key communities, you're a certified web3 analyst to me! https://t.co/YvMCdcV2t4"
80,"On thinking, you'll need to understand that open data now means ""open data pipeline"" rather than ""here's some CSVs for u"". This changes the flow of work and roles.

I walk through some technical examples of this flow, including a Uniswap proposal @alex_kroeger made last year! https://t.co/yLlwtLtsPn"
