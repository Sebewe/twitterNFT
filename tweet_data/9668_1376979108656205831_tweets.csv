31,You can also do this with treasures but I keep catching myself wanting to hoard those so I’m doing it with the pets instead
32,Been keeping a super close eye on the floor of the lower priced things on @Treasure_DAO marketplace like Smol Pets and Cars.  Going to start flipping a few of them. Quick in and out trades.  Layer 2 makes this a lot easier. 10-30 $magic profit on a trade consistently isn’t bad 👇
33,A puppy makes it difficult to keep up with my questing loop but I’m hitting twice a day and I’m ok with that. No treasures yesterday but woke up to an emerald and a gold coin today 2/5 on that quest. Sending them out again. @Treasure_DAO $magic
