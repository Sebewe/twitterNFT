10,@diego_bergia Congratulations bro!!! Sending you and the fam the biggest blessings that’s so special
11,I’ve never had the luxury of putting aside 2 months to get a grand collection created… and then build up for that epic reveal… I’m able to do that now for the first time and I have to say it is one of the most exciting and freeing processes for an artist to go through.

20,"Thanks for all the kind words. We just left the hospital and Baby G is fine: he’s probably gonna have a little scar which will hopefully just build some character.

My wife has convinced me to keep the puppy and try some training. Everyone will be okay: 👍"
21,Tough day today; our dog bit my son in the face and put a small gash in his nose. Now I’ve gotta let my best friend go to be a good dad.

31,"@grichl Life is tough; it really helps when you’re doing what you love daily.

If you can figure out a way to make any survivable amount of money doing what you love I strongly always recommend it"
32,@b1z1l1 Agree ❤️ Do what you love the money sincerely should not matter - assuming you’re fed and sheltered
33,"@Damienthefiend Basic essentials are necessary. I wish every person in the world had access to those basic essentials — my point is past that point and being able to buy your 1 favorite pair of shoes, money doesn’t do shit for your happiness. But loving your life does. Do what you love"
34,I’ve gotten to know quite a few millionaires this past year and I wanna say millionaires get hella sad too. The only way to true happiness is staying true to yourself; if you love you nothing else matters. I promise you. 🚀
35,@IGLIVISION Loves always the best way. Im too busy to focus on anything negative 🚀

68,@Pointshark1 You probably weren’t invisible enough
69,@madebynola I’ve never heard that before; do you know if that’s written somewhere? I’m happy to update the description of the collection to state it is 360 skulls
70,RT @eddiegangland: Please retweet this so someone at @opensea 🤡 sees this and does something finally

78,@GoOfficeNinja I hear you and it’s a beautiful idea but a little complex for me at the present moment. That would require a dev and a dedicated factory to start
79,@MikeGluck That’s one of my favorite illustrations I’ve ever made to this day.  I smile as soon as I see it.
80,@CJC_NFTs Right
81,@MitriTheGod It’s smart and definitely going to be something we see
82,@mosesray No. Available for any merch drop. I only said one time use because it helps prevent fraud. Basically any nft holder could get a 95% off for any merch drop anytime. Trying to make it almost free merch
83,@AstroCron @iwwon_official Yo I’m ducking down. Iwwon is dope
84,"💡 WHAT IF:

I offered exclusive merch drops available to my full Twitter following, BUT any of my NFT holders could obtain a one time use 95% off coupon whenever they wanted for any merch drop any time?

Wouldn’t that be cool?"
85,@_JKNFT_ Lmfaooooo
86,@BotJackpot I’ve got like 5 Jordan pog sets sealed in storage with slammers. You got a good eye for collectibles
87,@pascalblanche That’s what I’m honestly trying to decipher now. Collectibles is a market that is constantly changing and I’d like to offer something classic but iconic in some way. And it needs to be hand signed and sent out by me
88,@mindfulmania Thank you sincerely. Was actually just talking about you to my wife yesterday telling her how you’re this cool dude who has offered to help for no reason. Connect soon bro for sure
89,"@trueonelove21 My work around is to maybe offer these limited edition sales at a price that is incredibly under what the market would value it, only available to holders"
90,@trueonelove21 To be totally honest and transparent brotha I would love to have a way to give out merch to every holder of my NFTs. The issue I have at the moment is I would need to hire someone dedicated to just sending free shit out — not saying it’s never gonna happen just slammed rite now
91,@mindfulmania You could probably help me print my slammers. Brother trust me I’ve never forgotten about you I’m just running around working
92,@Kk27279007 Nah I’m thinking something way more exclusive - something hand signed and sent out by me with some extras
93,"Who knows what POGs are?

(Cardboard circular disks of art)"
94,@TyrrellCody Seat covers are a fucking cool idea
95,@Cute_Indulgence That’s a nice idea
96,@TyrrellCody Happy to work out a commission like that no problem
97,@anthonya That sounds awesome would you mind connecting us?
98,@mindfulmania Yo Gangland knuckle temporary tattoos is actually brilliant
99,@mindfulmania I love it!
