1,"To me, CryptoCubes are undervalued."
2,"What’s more, being the first 3D NFT in history (with a supply as small as 256) means that they have the potential to achieve “grail” NFT status (also known as one of the most infamous/notorious pieces of all NFTs)."
3,"If CryptoCubes were not the first 3D NFT to be created, we wouldn’t be discussing them. The fact that they are, though, means that they are where capital will flow first once the market awakes to this reality."
4,"If you agree that the emphasis on 3D NFT investing should increase, your next question may be why it should be CryptoCubes in particular that benefits from this shift. The answer: history."
5,"If the long-term bet is that we’ll have millions (if not billions) of people participating exclusively in virtual worlds, should we not be investing in 3D NFTs just as much (if not more) than 2D NFTs? I think this is a very important question for us to be asking."
6,I think one of the most essential components to understanding this bull thesis comes back to where we started when introducing CryptoCubes.
7,"If we reduced the supply of Doodles from 10,000 to 256, the floor would be roughly equal to 429 ETH. Compare this to the current 14 ETH entry available on CryptoCubes, and you’ll see where I’m coming from when I say the collection is undervalued."
8,"In a market so desperate for investments with truly unique value propositions and real utility, I find no such better example than CryptoCubes. Let’s do some quick math to support these claims. 

The Doodles floor (a 10,000 profile picture collection) is at 11 ETH."
9,"That’s not to say nobody wants to have anything to do with CryptoCubes - out of their supply of 256, only 11 are listed for sale, signaling that those who hold CryptoCubes have long-term conviction in the project."
10,"On this low supply basis, we can say that CryptoCubes has an astoninglishly low floor at 14 ETH. What’s even more absurd - the collection gets very little volume. In the last four weeks there has been just one sale."
11,"What may be the most appetizing aspect of CryptoCubes from an investment standpoint is their supply. Only 256 CryptoCubes are in existence. This number pales in comparison to the standard NFT collection of 10,000 or more in today’s market."
12,"In the words of their creator, “Each of the ""cubes"" can be easily traded, change location, customized, and potentially be a node of 3D metaverses thanks to the NFTs and Ethereum Blockchain”."
13,"As a result, Han created CryptoCubes. https://t.co/oaIfeLUWKD"
14,"When digital art backed by NFTs were beginning to popularize, @Hanrgb wondered why the emphasis was disproportionately on 2D art, especially given how much enthusiasm there was for Metaverse theory and the prospects of living in a fully built-out 3D world."
15,"CryptoCubes are cited as the first ever 3D-ready NFT. They were designed to exist as landmarks, composable technology, and pieces of art in The Metaverse, and I think they may be the most undervalued NFT in the world right now. 

So what are CryptoCubes? Let’s get into it."
16,"@punk6529 If their granted rights were akin to BAYC I’m doubtful they’d have reached the heights they have. There wouldn’t be enough to separate them from other new projects. 

Also, CC0 makes most sense given the art is actually taken from a (unofficially) CC0 meme in itself."

42,"@RaoulGMI In relation to that, I got my win. I bought Apes practically at 0 and don’t want to hold them at 0. I’m a first-year college student - I’d rather spend time finding the next thing I *know* will win than holding something I think *may* go up. End of thread."
43,"@RaoulGMI 3. Psychology. Sometimes, even if you think an asset will go up, it may still make most sense to sell it. What I mean by that is I’ve been in BAYC since basically its launch, and sometimes being in an echo chamber like that can warp your perception of the market. Cont’d…"
44,"@RaoulGMI 2. Personal portfolio management. Considering all of the above, it doesn’t make sense to have so much of my NW in one asset. Further, there are much better multiples out there I can earn on my now freed up capital than holding it in an Ape."
45,"@RaoulGMI A number of reasons. This will take a few tweets. 

1. Fundamental outlook. NFTs have been widely accepted to be in a bubble for a while now, interest rates look to be rising, geopolitical tension rising. Feels like the universe telling me to take my money and run."
46,"@whitbrannon Ha! Whatever happens, happens. The decision wasn’t just based on whether or not I think Apes are going to go up or down."
47,@girldelwoods Thank you. 🦧
48,@taylorgood It feels very refreshing. I love the Apes but boy does it good to be on the other side again.

65,"I sold my one and only Ape last night. 

Thank you to the Bored Ape Yacht Club community for the wild ride since May 2021.

I've been Ape-less before, but this feels like the real thing - I don't see myself buying back in for the foreseeable future. 

All the best."

72,"Was just talking with @AGORACOM about this - 

The risk of impermanent loss in crypto is absurdly higher than any (?) other industry. 

If there is one thing exploits like today show us, it’s that we’re still early."

82,"@VRS347 Can you clarify whether the WETH rewards stakers receive from the 2% platform fee is also being cut in half?

You say that it does in the thread you highlighted above but I don't seen any evidence that that is the case.

From what I can tell it's only the APR and trading rewards."
83,"@lickitysplit_7 What I would add to that which makes it more rational is that it would make me the 18th largest holder of $LOOKS in the market, so it's not as ""free money"" as it seems proportionally speaking."
84,"Would love to hear your interpretation of the above and below thoughts re: $LOOKS @gainzxbt @0x_fxnction 

https://t.co/hBLhS3xyAy"
85,"@lickitysplit_7 There are a few things stopping me from doing this, though:

1. existential threats: a) Coinbase NFT launching soon, b) potential for OpenSea token

2. not much confidence in team: their lockup is over in 150 days

3. fear of NFT market depression at large"
86,@lickitysplit_7 Just running numbers: it's wild that I can sell my Ape for 130 ETH right now (based on my trait's floor) and then make that back in WETH rewards in roughly 90 days if platform activity remains stable. Not included: price changes in $LOOKS and compounding $LOOKS.
87,"Just taking a quick look against OpenSea numbers via Dune Analytics, although there has been a slight drop off over the last two days, for the most part it seems as though platform volume is comparatively stable. 

https://t.co/f54s73cmhw"
88,"There must come a point where $LOOKS stops falling, purely based on the economics around staked $LOOKS accruing WETH rewards. 

Unless the platform stops being used. 

Has volume on LooksRare dried up?"
89,"@MacDreidel We are 30 days in, so in 150 days."
90,"The fact that the lockup period for these initial investors expires so soon also does not inspire confidence, I'm sure."
91,"LooksRare is such a great idea. The tokenomics, trading rewards, all of it. 

The only thing holding it back is its team. What have these NFT traders ever built in their life?

If the platform was operated by a doxxed, professional team, $LOOKS would be through the roof."
92,"It’s always laughable to me seeing NFTers make claims about profile picture market structures. “Chance for cheap derivatives with niche communities”. 

There is no such thing as a pfp market. Apes and Punks, everything else goes to zero. 

Enough w the pseudo intellectuality. https://t.co/HmVTkK7E2H"

94,Are you ready for The Big Sleep if it comes?
95,"This verified badge, logo, or whatever it ends up being, will also be necessary to stop imposters from dawning their self-created Ape."
96,"What we will have, though, is a verified BAYC logo somewhere on or around our digital avatar. 

*This* is what we are paying for.

Will you be able to identify an Ape just by their appearance - most likely, but we will be highly differentiated from where we are today."
97,"In The Metaverse, Bored Apes will not look as they do now. 

Our baseline features may be the same, but we will be customizing our look with other clothing, accessories, and apparel. 

We won't look like Bored Apes."
98,@SanchisFortea @SahilBloom @Domahhhh @Kalshi Because you can bet on them through the above platform. Makes it more exciting.
