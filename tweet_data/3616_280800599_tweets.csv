10,"@blackbeard120 @davpleb @Pixelmon @Syberer @voxodeus $10k in ""meme""ories"
11,@skrari4 I have 2 coming to my dealership shortly. 95% conquest rate which means it's all people who don't own Fords buying it. Voted best ev this year. Go for it
12,@davpleb @Pixelmon @Syberer @voxodeus Pixelmon is better for memes tho
13,@dadjudicator @Pixelmon Exactly. It's worth more unrevealed
14,@dadjudicator @Pixelmon Then it might be worth half mint cost lol. What's the point
15,@samuelgigi @Pixelmon I'm down 2.5 and climbing fast lol. No point in selling now. Will wait till the end of the year and tax loss harvest
16,@dadjudicator @Pixelmon No way in hell I'm hatching mine. It's staying locked up forever
17,"Even though I spent 3 eth on @Pixelmon and got absolutely rugged, the memes make up for it. Top quality work everyone."
18,@djhodl @voxodeus @TheSandboxGame Pixelmon is way better

25,Nft's/crypto seem so pointless with everything going on right now. I'm taking a break. Be safe everyone.
26,@elitfourr @TheSnoopAvatars Maybe metamask can help me with my issues too
27,@NFTArtCritic @hotlneblng_ I had 5 eth set aside. These prices are unsustainable
28,Also why are people spending 12 eth. This is crazy.

35,@money_ba11 @smidge @integ03 Nope. Going for public.
36,This market is so oversaturated. So many new projects popping up constantly. Remember that most are just cash grabs and 99% of projects fail.

51,@AutFlipside I'm an automatic no on celeb projects regardless. 99.99% chance it's a cash grab
52,@dadjudicator Signed up for the raffle without even looking. Stack whitelists and decide later is my motto
53,@AhoiMalloy And 99.99% fail. Why not lower the mint and make up for the lower initial funds by building a great project and community and getting the funds on secondary percentages. So many just mint out and then stop building. They don't care they got the money
54,@RichestManInLDN And 99.9% fail
55,@deanas32 EVERY PROJECT. 0.1 is the minimum now. When we used to mint for .03-0.7 on the regular back in the day.
56,Mint prices are so stupid on every new project now. The greed is insane.
