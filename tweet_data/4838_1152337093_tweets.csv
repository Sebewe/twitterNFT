4,I just found out about Broxh and now I’d like to go to New Zealand just to meet him. I’ve had no interest in the country before this point. I’m sure it’s a great place just never had a desire.
5,So does everyone on twitter work on 3 DAOs at once? Seems a little unfocused.
6,Well done @YouTube  @Google https://t.co/sa8Z9Q4szQ

15,@kagami_nft Great thread thx for writing.
16,"Putin had lost, even if he takes Ukraine. Lost of freedom to move, movement of capital, country is handicapped, and lots more. Even if peace is negotiated, Putin will still need to be held accountable. If there’s no upside why would someone negotiate?"
17,@BetterNotWorse @RepMTG My heart breaks as an American watching this. This is such an shameful smear to our country.
18,@joshqharris What did the reference check say? And how did they find a reference when you didn’t have any prior work experience (or did you?).

23,@cr0ssETH Not associated just offering a different perspective.
24,@cr0ssETH If u chose to invest in this NFT project - u should know the upfront capital dynamics as an investor. The team in returns get to benefit financially like any other project/job. The quality of the work is another topic. The only villain here is people’s lack of self awareness.
25,@Austen Are you from there?
26,@johncutlefish Imo: having a backlog is pointless.

29,"Ask Twitter:

Is there some fancy app that connects all my credit cards, debit cards, bank accounts, and NICELY categorizes and makes everything searchable?"
30,@christianreber Agree with directionally. But I’d limit to all government officials and relevatives of officials then scale up to increase pressure if need be.

43,RT @DLeonhardt: Western leaders describe the sanctions against Russia as strong and severe. They’re actually quite cautious.  https://t.co/…
44,@amasad I’ve always felt this to be true. Yet I’ve never found the right adjective to describe it. “Dispassionately” is very fitting. Thank for describing something accurately that I truly believe.
45,@asanwal From one of the most respected new sources in the world imo.

52,"@nikillinit As you can see from everyone’s response (not very original) every tweet in itself is signalling. Clout chasing is just a more dedicated signalling. So to answer your question: Yes, but so is most things we do."
53,@wesyang None nether until I moved to Europe. It’s an important country. I’d say 50% of tech companies in Berlin employ at least one Ukrainian. Most Ukrainians living and work professionally in other EU countries are developers. Very important part of the ecosystem.
54,@Austen Outrageous. Absolutely heart breaking my stupid. So much wealth and no independence.

62,Double fuck war. https://t.co/2oAOicvzTC
63,@wavetovk @mwseibel You’re missing my point. You said SV can’t solve everything. I’m saying it doesn’t matter if it’s SV or somewhere else.
64,Putin is a monster. These are my words but I’d be shocked if anyone in my network disagrees.
65,"@mwseibel I think a more targeted approach makes sense. Block all Russian government entities from those services (+agencies that do government projects). Putin positions his rule as all powerful, show that he’s as dependent on other countries as all of us."
66,@mwseibel On the tweet: The fact you have to start with honest question shows the amount of useless cynicism we expect from twitter. On the question: deterring isn’t the answer. It’s removal of the access of power (aka resources) from a historically selfish leader.
67,@wavetovk @mwseibel People should try to be useful no matter the industry they’re in. Blind sided to let something as pointless as an area code define if you should try to help others.

79,@ShaanVP Similar question: I have a bunch of emails how do I find their instagram?
80,@realEstateTrent Chinese?
81,@HilaryShirazi Im from LA. I bought for my mom and ex girlfriend 17 years. They have never used in their entire lives. I think it’s safe than sorry - but statistically it’s unlikely useful. Though when it is useful it’s probably worth it (like insurance)
82,@Suhail And his mom deserves so much respect. So much love and confidence for her song. The scene when they’re sitting on the porch was pure beauty.
83,"@Suhail Almost cried. Was beautiful in so many unexpected ways. The footage was so nostalgic, similar to last dance. His obsession with being great is just beyond belief."

92,Loving this series https://t.co/YG7GdFuPFu
93,How I deal with rude people: be really really really nice to them. Most rudeness comes from a bad day. Solve the core problem not the side effects.
94,@sama Every faang has the huge % of smart people. But mistakes and problems will always arise. It’s rarely smart individual contributors that “make bad decisions” it’s the culture that creates tension points that go unresolved which leads to bad outcomes.
95,@JasonRBradwell Banh mi - it’s delicious when done right. Simple to food plan. Delivers well.
96,@sriramk So connect with wallet as authentication source instead of social login provider? I’m sure @auth0  is considering it 😬
