This is a criminal negligence on your organisation’s part and u can’t be exempted from it.
84,@dfinzer @opensea What about me? I had just accepted an offer on one of my NFTs in Weth and I didn’t receive a penny while my NFT is gone from my wallet! This was not an all alone phishing attack! Check out ticket# 331724. One can’t even accept any offer on OS!!!
