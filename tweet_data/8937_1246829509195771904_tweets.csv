2,"@RealCryptoCoach @PantherQB19 @MattyRos5 @WGAlphaGame But really, what did he do? “You know well” is not enough - which move/attack are you blaming @PantherQB19 specifically for? I’m curious, really."
3,@ryder_ripps Correct.
4,"@ryder_ripps And that proves my point again, you want to portray it so it matches up with your claim. You did not say ""most of the clothes traits"". If only the clothes traits are problematic then say it like this."
5,"@ryder_ripps I did not say that, I don't find the same connections as you do. I was just pointing out that you show the stats the way you like."
6,"@ryder_ripps I did not count background colors, that would be an extra 8. 43 traits for clothing. My point is that you are bending the facts to your own good."
7,"@ryder_ripps 35/160 is not ""most"". I am just picking because you have been saying you rely on facts and pointing out very specific stuff on others posts. To me it just seems you are trying to amplify your messages by portraying an incorrect picture."
8,@ryder_ripps How many traits in total?
