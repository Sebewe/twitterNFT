We’ve already seen the start of this with axie infinity which by all accounts is a piss-poor game.
The first good game with p2e elements and good tokenomics will change the industry. @BYOPills is my best bet."

Take this spending into a game where you actually own and can re-sell your items. This takes it from a cost —&gt; investment.
If you produce a good game, this is going to change the way we view gaming forever"

People are spending 54bn USD on in-game purchases globally a year. They don’t own these, they can’t resell them. 
These are consumer items that they can use in a game.
So this is a pure cost to the players."

Does it mean the team is suddenly inept? Definitely not.

We have a fantastic team willing 2 work hard, huge ambitions &amp; a strong community.

I’m obviously biased, but I think you need consistent work over time to build anything great.

TL;DR I think the cats are undervalued"
89,"3/4
So if a collection has an apparent failure that’s going to have a large impact on price short term.

We’re seeing this with @coolcatsnft atm.

Is the game launch difficulty a good sign? Probably not. A sign they work at bleeding edge though."
90,"2/4

If a team / collection has had hype for a while they’ve been able to 1) build a large war chest 2) build a strong team 3) build a strong product

In the startup world that’s real value.
In Web 3.0 prices are much more sensitive to short term signal."
91,"1/4 On @coolcatsnft and why now is the time to buy.

In Web 3.0 hype is to a degree self-fulfilling.
Hype pushes up price of a collection as well as volume ➡️ increased revenue from secondaries ➡️ ability to invest in team and brand ➡️ increased status ➡️ increased hype"
92,@yearyoungr Wow that is insane if true. Seems like I misread the situation. Thanks for clarifying!
93,@yearyoungr No rush - look forward to hearing your thoughts!
