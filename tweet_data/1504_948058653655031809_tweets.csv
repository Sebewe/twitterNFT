Each @doodles spaceship and space traits are predetermined.
Meaning there is no point of holding one undocked to potentially receive better ships and traits rolls. 

The only gain of not launching is the surprise for you (or next buyer) on what it looks like."

Every 24 hrs a new Noun NFT is introduced to be auctioned. Est in 12/1/21
Thus increasing supply SLOWLY.
