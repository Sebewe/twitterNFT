29,"A sidenote on this: The longer you're in crypto the more numb you get to massive swings in price. This can be for better or worse. The good is when it helps you manage things better, the bad is when you just miss times you should seriously re-evaluate your thesis."
30,"What's the main takeaway? Remembering that it's more important to get ROI on your mental health than your $. 

Not only will you feel better, but you will make better decisions.

The worst is when people are fully panic-hopping with everything they have, to chase a quick fix."
31,"Or in the case of moving to stablecoins or long-term assets, you have plenty of opportunities in defi to still put those assets to work. Go find something that will safely earn you 10% APY, it still beats banks by a long-shot."
32,"3. There's always more opportunities in crypto.

Just because you sell out, remember that you're not losing every single opportunity. In some markets, you can sell 50% and move it right into a new opportunity, completely forgetting about your previous loss."
33,"I looked at the asset, thought about what felt like a comfortable amount to take out where if it tanked or if it pumped, I'd be fine with my decision.

Basically, set yourself up for future emotional safety so it never even gets to this point again."
34,"I also decided to get 100% out of ""shitcoins"" that I decided did not have strong enough staying power to weather a bear market.

How did I get to these percentages?"
35,"For example, last night I recognized I did not have enough diversification into ""safer"" assets.

I took out around 50% of many projects I still like and believe in, but could see going lower. Moving them into stables (I rarely hold stables, I have degenitis)"
36,"2. Don't think all-or-nothing, think in percentages.

What I see most commonly is people thinking they either have to sell everything or hold it all. It couldn't be further from the truth.

Instead, use your evaluation to gauge what % adjustment would regulate your emotions"
37,"There can be more than the above, but this information gathering is vital for making the right move. This evaluation could mean you're no longer panicked and realize you're fine where you are. But if not, the next tips are for you."
38,"- What are you more worried about? It dropping further or selling now and missing out on potential recovery / future gains?
- Do you believe that the current issue will last a long or short amount of time?
- How is your personal life affected by this getting worse before better?"
39,"- Is it a widespread market crash or specific to this investment?
- Re-evaluate your original thesis. Do you still believe in it based on what caused the crash?
- What % of your portfolio is in this investment? (This could be alts vs btc/eth or could be crypto vs stables, etc)"
40,"You know the feeling where something you own drops and you feel panicked? That is often a sign that you are over-invested, or do not have a strong enough thesis to weather out dips.

Your next move should be to emotionally regulate yourself. There's a few steps."
41,"1. Investing is often a game of emotion management and self-awareness.

You can discover a lot of the right next steps by evaluating how you and your body are responding to market movements.

For example..."
42,"It doesn't feel right writing about portfolio management, but I know that there are some people who are likely looking for advice and too afraid to ask.

If it can help anyone, then it's worth writing out. Let's get into it:"
43,"First, I just wish that this current geopolitical issue wasn't the reason I had to do so. It pains me to see that we still live in a world where land control actually matters to some leaders."
44,"The current climate can leave you stuck on how you should manage your funds, whether you're new to crypto or not.

I'm going to write out some tips on what's worked well for me in volatile times. Things I've learned from multiple bear markets I poorly handled."
45,"The frustration of wanting to help, with uncertainty in how to do so, is a very somber experience."
