3,"@almostraymond @jakewittman that cali culture baby.. just hits diffy

that being said, there are better burgers out there for sure. its just the experience that is special for someone like me personally"
4,"@jakewittman theres a number of reasons why cali people hype up in n out:
1. Consistently good
2. Very cheap for the quality of ingredients (less than 10 bucks for an entire meal)
3. Open late (clutch af)
4. Encapsulates cali culture/nostalgia

It just hits different if you grew up here"

16,"Are all NFTs overvalued? Does floor price really indicate success? If 50% nuke from here, is it a fail event if mint is still up 10x+? Are 1 year time frames reasonable to slap on any project?

If eth nukes back to 300, but keeps same fundamentals, are you still just as bullish?"
