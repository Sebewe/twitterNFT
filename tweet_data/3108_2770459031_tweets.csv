14,@PatrickBatemanT @shanicucic96 @neotokyonewstv Having a roadmap is saving no project on earth. Look at The Doge Pound. They have one of the biggest roadmaps I‘ve seen and check their chart. Roadmaps and promises are unsustainable but you don’t get it.

61,@Xballer66 Yeah sounds good
62,@0xfoobar @0xQuit It’s impressive what he does but sickening at the same time
63,@ILikeNFTs What a kind guy
64,This feels like the apocalypse in NFT land rn. Nobody feels safe.
65,@imsacredd @Z_Felds @AJFromDiscord @opensea Wtf how is opensea not saying anything yet??

72,"@JGxFocus333 @AzukiZen @divineanarchy Seems that Azuki just succeeded in becoming a brand. The team seems to be more competent. Art also is liked more. People also said that timing in the market of the drop also played a factor. 
I knew nothing about them either but was curious because as an outsider it wasn’t clear."
73,Disclosure: I‘m not holding or ever had one of these
74,@JGxFocus333 @AzukiZen @divineanarchy Divine Anarchy came way before Azuki.
75,@_miketriumph_ @SwoleLuksoBags Where is the rumor coming from? 🤔
76,@wiseleopard1 @BoredApeYC Think so too. Might be even conservative who knows.
77,"@wiseleopard1 @BoredApeYC I think it’s good we’re at 1/5 of an ape.
This way mutants will see such a big rise when $APE comes out and allocation is not 1/5 but much higher. 
It surely won’t be 1/5 or lower.
Mutants = Apes. 
20 eth is actually a joke"
78,"@CLOUD_STR1FE @AzukiZen @divineanarchy Interesting 
Thank you for your perspective!"
79,@irmisssima @AzukiZen @divineanarchy Yeah that probably causes the difference of 14 eth in floor thanks 😁
80,@CapetainTrippy 100% true
81,"@krackheadsnft @SteveyTrommm @opensea Sorry for your loss but your NFTs are stolen and OpenSea can’t do anything about it. Banning the items from the marketplace is not the way. 
How could it have been fixed in your opinion?"
82,"What made @AzukiZen (14.5 eth floor) different from @divineanarchy (0.2 eth floor)?
Really curious https://t.co/VObwDACFHC"
83,@jpegplug Best decision in my life was to mint one and hold
84,@PtyronSrb @SlamDiegoZoo @OGDfarmer You get those $MILK tokens by questing with your cool pet for free. Up to 500 per day. Those will be used to upgrade your pet. You don’t actually have to spend 1.67 eth. It’s just the equivalent in value.

88,"@wagmi_x 1 BAYC for sure
5 mutants would make me think."
89,@GodsoeJosh @cobie How do you own NFTs and still say that BAYC (the biggest and most popular project) is all wash trading? Sad.

91,@NathanHeadPhoto That’s very controversial
92,@frankiebuys @CapetainTrippy I mean shortly after when they dropped. 26 fucking eth for an ape and it’s only few months ago.
93,"@CapetainTrippy The floor of the apes around the time of the MAYC mint reached about 26 eth.
It’s crazy"
