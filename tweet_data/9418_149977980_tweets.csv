2,"... if you disagree or I have made any false claims, please let me know and I will be happy to adjust my comments. together we are strong 🤜🤛"
3,btw this is my first thread about handling in the NFT world. I try to share my experiences so that others can benefit from them. because in my opinion education is the most important thing in a new space like web3 …
4,8/ this brings me back to a thought I have had since last week: why is there no solution out there where people can verify resources by a creator contract? so creators are able to communicate important resources with an on-chain transaction and people can trust this data?
5,7/ to TDLR: don't believe any resource out there if it's not directly from the project itself + always double-check before you interact with any kind of blockchain.
6,"6/ even better, ask the devs to publish the right contract address (etherscan link) to their website and discord. with that, you just copy the contract address, search on opensea by it and save then the collection in your watchlist the first time."
7,"5/ …
3. verify this contract address with the one shared by admins of the project
4. if it doesn't match, IT'S A FAKE ONE!
5. report it (the more people report, the sooner the fake collection gets removed"
8,"4/ so I recommend the following steps, every time you want to buy an NFT or at least check if it's the right collection:

1. if you come to a detailed view of an NFT, click on details and then on contract address
2. this opens up etherscan, copy the contract address
…"
9,"3/ https://t.co/GQKUEF6TkB

what do you learn from it? be always sure – even if you think @TwitterBlue verification pretend to be a real NFT – that you only buy from a shared link by the creators themselves."
10,"2/ first we thought it was a @opensea API glitch that leads to a wrong creator address, but after some investigation with the admins, they found out, that the scammer just sent 88 items of the fake collection to the creator address of the real @beanbagfrens"
11,"1/ another community member over at @beanbagfrens reported, that their @TwitterBlue verified NFT avatar links to kinda a weird profile with a weird @rarible fake collection."

34,@hanyrizk_ @voellmy42 @AragonProject you nailed my point even better! 💪🏼
35,"@voellmy42 @hanyrizk_ @AragonProject sure, but we have to differentiate a little bit imo, because the web3 is at the same stage as the internet was in the 90s. until we are at the stage of possibilities like a transformation to an iPhone-like experience, the technology has to mature further."
