26,"@tresorprivedxb @kuramaeth Yes I know, but this scales on peoples portfolio.

There are a lot of projects I wanted to enter in february, looks like this is the only one in my list I can enter. Invisible Friends &amp; Voyagers will probably not be under 4 eth soon."
27,"@tresorprivedxb @kuramaeth I could agree with the fact that it's a lot of money. But I'd rather put 0.7 eth in a project I like and I believe in, than 0.05 in 12 projects that make absolute no sense"
28,@kuramaeth @tresorprivedxb You can check them all out on twitter. This is not a new anon team. https://t.co/ARvVZ9QKB6
29,@kuramaeth @tresorprivedxb This is exactly a project where I am not scared at all about a rug pull.
30,"@tresorprivedxb @kuramaeth 2. The team seems very strong and know how to work stuff out, heard some of them speak and it makes me very confident they will work hard to make this a great project.

3. They locked profit and still have a lot to come we don't know. I love the surprises."
31,"@tresorprivedxb @kuramaeth I kinda disagree here. 

Not every project has to deliver ""stacking, game, new releases, etc.. "" .

Firstly, I like the art, this is subective, but I could see my mom using this as a PFP as well. The audience they can target is really wide. ( unlike our well beloved project )"

54,"@creepztopia I'll never jump on a fellow creepz. We are in this together.

I was investing most of what I've had from start on genesis because I knew that's where they wanted to drive the value.
