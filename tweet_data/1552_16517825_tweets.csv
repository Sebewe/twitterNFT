14,"Hope this was helpful! The goal of this thread was to explain L2's in such a way that crypto newbies will understand them.

For an in-depth look into Ethereum scaling:

https://t.co/W95iUJQph2

Here's a great read on rollups from @VitalikButerin himself:

https://t.co/CHdTuNA2cO"
15,"In short, Layer 2's solve Ethereum's pain points like high gas fees and slow speeds, without sacrificing on security.

Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem is incredibly vibrant - as shown in this visual by @deversifi: https://t.co/END8tJidXG"
16,"In brief, ZK Rollups are more sophisticated - more efficient with higher transaction rates - but require more computing power, which is not ideal for smaller applications with less activity

For a much more technical deep-dive, this is a great resource:

https://t.co/QJuC0kxPIV"
17,"There are two types of rollups.

Optimistic Rollups (like Arbitrum) and the more popular Zero-knowledge (ZK) Rollups (like Polygon, Immutable X and Loopring)"
18,"Rollups reduce gas fees by executing transactions off of layer 1.

They are highly secure because the data and proof of transactions still reside on layer 1.

This data stored on L1 can interact with the rollup smart contract on L2 to enforce proper transaction execution."
19,"How do these work, in simplest terms?

Layer 2 is basically compressing a bunch of transactions, then posting the data to Layer 1, instead of processing each transaction individually.

These are called rollups."
20,"This is obviously not ideal — Enter Layer 2 solutions. 

Popular ones include Polygon, Immutable X, Arbitrum and Polkadot.

These are projects built on top of the Ethereum - with the intention of making transactions faster, more secure - and more scalable."
21,"Ethereum is the most popular, and widely-used blockchain on the planet.

However, Ethereum has expensive gas fees, and very slow throughput. The Ethereum mainnet can only process 13 transactions per second.

(For comparison, Solana does 65,000 TPS)"

When you’re in it for yourself - a $ or follower number you want to achieve - you’re susceptible to burnout when momentum slows.
