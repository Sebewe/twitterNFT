37,"RT @msistema1: It makes me really glad when a collector appreciates what’s behind the piece and not just the potential value, thanks! ❤️"
38,"What a lovely surprise, snatching a piece, that the legendary @Crypto888crypto also desired 🔥

What strikes me about this is the transcending tension @msistema1 builds between an apparently innocent object and some sort of (sexual) connotation we attach to it. #nftart https://t.co/996FvKS2Vn"

46,@she_force @prrfbeauty @YFLinkio Thanks! What tx did you get in the end?
47,"Spent the last 8 mins refreshing, now I can officially announce: IT'S OVER! #beeple @makersplaceco @beeple https://t.co/M5gU3RJFZv"
48,"7./ And you know what? IM NOT SELLING! 

(unless @0x_b1 comes and wants it) https://t.co/BFhQqUOMTf"
49,"6./ So here I am, with my first @prrfbeauty:

""The arrival"" marks 0x_b1s glorious entry into 
@YFLinkio – an everlasting representation of the first $YFL purchase he made. A marvellous #nftart derived from the transaction itself: https://t.co/ufCgWUxD1q"
50,"5./ I thought about the projects and tokens that had brought me into the crypto space and made me feel part of the community. Inevitably, @YFLinkio came to mind. And with $YFL, the unrivalled participation of one of the biggest market makers in the game: @0x_b1"
51,"4./ I gave it up after several tries when even the Neon Cat sale-tx was already minted. So I thought about turning something personal into an #NFT on-chain. This way I could finally snatch my first @prrfbeauty. Though in the end, It wasn't that personal after all."
52,"3./ This time I tried to snatch the hashes of big #NFT sales in recent weeks and months. An NFT that resulted from the purchase of another NFT - brilliant, right?

It turns out that there are many brilliant and cunning minds in Crypto and the apes don't sleep."
53,2./ I researched all the hashes of every famous hack I've known of on the Ethereum chain and was presented with a lovely generated NFT each time—that already belonged to someone else. A few days later I changed my strategy.
54,"1./ When I first stumbled across the project, only 300 $HASH had been minted. I immediately aped in and looked for hashs that I felt deserved to become a generative NFT.

And I failed. Every single tx I've entered into the gorgeous interface was already taken. I was bewildered."
55,"0./ Now that @prrfbeauty is slowly getting the appreciation it truly deserves, I would like to tell you my own POB story about searching for the perfect tx to mint.

Who is ready for a #nftart thread? 👇🏻"

59,"Any experience with presenting #NFT on Samsungs ""The Frame"" or other Smart TV devices? Seems so natural to show my collection like that, but so far I haven't found a way to do so. I only know the amazing @zendvibes_ but would like to use my own display 👀 #cryptoart https://t.co/T9R9hN4nrx"
60,"@fastackl @timrix @AnestiDhima Woah, never though of that but somehow it‘s totally rationale. I would also automatically value an artpiece more on the secondary market if @fastackl and @scottbelsky had a bidding war on it beforehand. As with the ownership, it‘s becomes part of the piece itself."

64,"Elon entering the NFT space would not only mean a new era for renowned artists like @muratpak, @alessiodevecchi or @Hackatao, just to name a few. But also rising artists like @ForkoshNadiia or @Crypt0Art could dramatically raise their profile being featured on the same platform."
