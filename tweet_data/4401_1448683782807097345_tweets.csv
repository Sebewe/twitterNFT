44,"@digitalartchick If you look at the previous stages of the market, NFT prices will start to rise even before ETH gets stable"
45,@ZssBecker He's just bragging)
46,@official_mu00 @LazyLionsNFT Welcome to family KING!😍
47,@sailormarsnft MekaVerse did not deceive anyone in fact. This guy just played with the OpenSea algorithms. People did all the marketing for him he just created fake activity
48,"@sailormarsnft It is very difficult to invest in a team of any size if you do not know at least a little with the creators. There are small start-ups that want to make money, and there are individuals who want to make history!"
49,@HoneyzNft @BossBeautiesNFT @CowgirlsNFT @Crypto__Chicks @RebelSocietyNFT @PowerOfWomenNFT @alphagirlclub @WomenandWeapons Someday I will be on a par with these cool women! You are beautiful 😍😍💃
50,@sailormarsnft It is a fact. A big problem
51,@modhasthoughts @real_frackt I'm not a guy and you disgust me
52,@UnpopularEGirls Waiting for summer😍😍
53,@real_frackt @modhasthoughts Sometimes it seems to me that there are many more. Thanks to Twitter for the update it should help us
54,@real_frackt @modhasthoughts #BAYC and #LazyLions have strong community for example. But they exist on their own level. Many NFT whales can unite to form a common aggregator and help other
55,"@real_frackt @modhasthoughts Much is formed locally around collections. There are many strong communities, but they all exist only in their own universe."
56,"@real_frackt @modhasthoughts There will always be a lot of scammers, because the community is weak. We should help each other more"
57,@real_frackt @modhasthoughts If we talk more about scammers and scammers we can form a good community. There are many enthusiasts like me who want to make it better.
58,@modhasthoughts Unfortunately many people are not well aware of a good community.
59,@LeoColdHeart @Twitter This guy says smart things!
60,"@raderoony You are right, but this is a metastyle invented by the founders. The problem is not in the NFT as a matter of fact, the problem is in those who promoted it from the beginning. It will definitely change.)"
61,@raderoony You have beautiful art. But why do you think he is better than others? What is its value?
62,@NotPrepBatman clown joke?))
63,"@fagathaharknes NFT was formed not by the most beautiful collections. For this reason, many created similar art, forming an opinion. Now everything is different, a lot of beautiful collections are simply unknown"
64,"@MyMrFlibble I think you're wrong. The community is full of scammers, but this does not mean that there is no light in the dark
Good luck, I hope you find your light"
65,@UrvogelGallus cool picture

68,"The story looks rather plausible, though. 
You’re saying you’re not guilty and all they say is nothing more than a slander. Show people some proofs cause the only thing I see is @WinnyDipp screenshots. 

@ToxicDegen If you say nothing, it’s still gonna look like you’ve done wrong https://t.co/Uk4wSg5RjL"
