1,@NFTsAreNice One project in particular has probably accounted for like 30% of my lifetime losses.  Not going to state it but it came from blind optimism towards the founder

96,"@WonderPals How will the process go for those who are in the Raffle public mint list but not on the Discord?

Will it be the same link that you are using on your website to mint?  Will we just need to refresh constantly at 2pm PST/5pm EST until it opens or will there be something else?"
