1,"those space doodles look so nice, but my doodles won‘t go into space any time soon as it would cost me 30k in taxes to transform my 2 doodles. End of the year i could go to space tax free 🙈 @doodles"
2,"@Coin_Tracking an individual NFT. Lets say i have 10 Doodles and technically they are all listed under DOODLE (as a token). Therefore i would assume i can apply LIFO/FIFO. I don‘t want to number, also ETH + DEX is not importing it that way. Everything is a doodle and not doodle#1, doodle#2 etc."
3,@Coin_Tracking But don I have to as it is the same coin?
4,@wabdoteth @OfficialFoxGame was a super successful rug https://t.co/GXEMtAcECm
5,@Coin_Tracking Is LIFO also applicable for NFT‘s? I mean they are unique but at the same time listed under the same token. They can vary in value quite extreme.

19,"@Coin_Tracking @Alpha_design03 ok, i understand. I thought you might have an answer as you have this twitter thing going on answering tax related questions. And yes - the whole point of having your software is not making use of a tax advisor. 🥸 at least for me."
20,"Hey @Coin_Tracking, can you help out with an important question? I have a rugged NFT project and nobody wants to buy because of gas. Can i burn these NFT‘s and realize losses according to german tax law or does it have to be a trade? You would help me with this a looot ;)"
