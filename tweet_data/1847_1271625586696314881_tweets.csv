6,Why should one support @FloorDAO ? In order to get deep liquidity on NFTX for instant trades (buy / sell). In this case for #cryptopunks. $PUNK and $PUNK-$ETH that is bonded becomes permanent. https://t.co/aUWzaywiCq

22,"I would do the same if I was in Russia. That is: convert as much as I can to crypto, especially $BTC and $ETH. https://t.co/6cOPj0FFUZ"
23,Some reasonable likelihood that #cryptopunks could flip BAYC the next days. @FloorDAO
24,@jerrybrito @Ukraine Price manipulation from BTC whales in order to beat ETH donations.
25,This will also allow mercenaries to enter the conflict. In case you don’t know: the US used a large count of mercenaries in the recent wars. Cruel advantage: they don’t appear on death stats and no need to pay relatives. https://t.co/2Horkqybgr
26,@xali_ism @rleshner Discord link ?
27,Many surprises lately. Probably too much pressure from the US and it’s neighbors. https://t.co/OMXDZeoXlt
28,"@WizzyTac What if Russia uses or creates its own fiat ramps. The local currency is not attractive, though things will stabilize eventually after the conflict is over."
29,Maybe the US gov doesn’t know about DeFi yet. https://t.co/CUvtsSBysq
30,This is a strong signal. https://t.co/mgNOtdlHvS
31,"This is fine, you can join via Zoom dude. https://t.co/rui3YXRhQs"
32,Safe to say that Russia will reduce using the USD moving forward and strongly prefer using other payment rails. Maybe more than one ? Maybe also crypto ? https://t.co/0bR9WytSVG
33,I am glad to admit that this doesn’t seem to age well. The EU is stepping up in an unexpected and previously unseen way. Looks like a red line was crossed that woke up various EU leaders from their deep sleep. https://t.co/XGcArn1QqW
34,@Blockworks_ We have seen this headline before.
35,"@ASvanevik Ser, stani is not the Russian gov, so it probably is true."

42,"This is concerning and should trigger strong resistance from NATO.

https://t.co/681VF2mRsT"
43,The nuclear verbal thread worries many. I believe the highest likely response will be cyber attacks. Nuclear escalation (if it happens) would occur towards the end of the escalation. https://t.co/TrTvbKfS1V
44,A new era begins. I expect this protocol to change the NFT landscape radically. It will create deep liquidity and bump the floor wherever it sweeps. https://t.co/IKUsjXGE2t
45,"The probability of a nuclear war is very low. Game theoretically it is a loss for both sides. The sides being Russia and NATO. Low prob, however not impossible. Still, don’t panic. https://t.co/oOWTv4hqyp"
46,Oh yes. https://t.co/ewVqJ7oo1r
47,"The above assumes that the gov will eventually know who is the owner of an address. Which will be true for most cases as they use CEXes, and at least for FIAT ramps."
48,"And even if one uses privacy tech to hide that you did the tx, you will end up receiving a physical good from a country that is banned and you will need to explain yourself regardless.

49,"Even though crypto is censorship resistant on the protocol level, there can still be enforcement on the social layer. Say you buy Russian gas with BTC even though your gov bans this action. The payment tx will succeed, however your gov will see the tx and can go against you.

50,It is not a new pattern for Russian leaders to thread with the use of nuclear weapons. Boris Yeltsin threaded during the US intervention in Serbia-Kosovo that he is targeting western cities if the US doesn't stop the attacks. The attacks did not stop. https://t.co/YUTsouY87C
51,This is accurate. https://t.co/YVl0GpKJXT
52,So it begins. https://t.co/3oFx2QDiLl
53,@ASvanevik @nansen_alpha Not too bad for 5000 $ per month.

This is next level. https://t.co/OChbWzqlF8"
58,Very accurate. https://t.co/uxzoAGVmIN
59,I would disagree however that the contribution is 'dramatically' better. A country like Germany is able to contribute much more. They are still rather hesitant.
60,Looks like there is some movement. I couldn't find details on the SWIFT thing. So I would wait for confirmation. https://t.co/DhJpmUuKU3

63,"Trying to read the impact of monetary policy on asset performance is not working well under extreme conditions. Personally gave up trying to predict what the FED's or other agencies action will do.

65,"Be aware that this is likely funding military operation.
No judgement."
66,This has been confirmed to be legit. https://t.co/8ay8FFfwl7
67,@Salt_crypt It would certainly hurt them if they reduce or stop imports from Russia. So it is a tricky situation.
68,"@Salt_crypt They froze their nuclear program and thought it is a great idea to rely on Russian energy resources instead, such as via natural gas."
69,"Unfortunately, this is aging well. 'Sanctions' so far are a joke. Freezing Putins assets ? Are you fucking kidding us you lizards. The only serious measure would be the exclusion from Swift, which without surprise, is facing resistance from the gov of Germany. https://t.co/5Z3v6vA5Wd"

79,"If this is true, why the fuck would one attack and damage the reactor structure ? https://t.co/SmZTarNoDa"
80,@SvengardHoek It is unlikely that an aggressor starts a war campaign without sufficient supplies (including funding).
81,"@famoo_nft It is a tricky situation indeed. One where both sides (NATO and Russia) hold thousands of nukes. Sane players are unlikely to make use of these. Let's hope that sanity prevails, long term."
82,"I would lose my shit if I was standing there, get dizzy, and fall down. https://t.co/JsWjxu47sd"
83,True. Another relationship that often applies is: intelligent --&gt; not rich https://t.co/DXrsuBWwgR

89,Rather swift recovery. https://t.co/s7Gd0PvBi8
90,The article: https://t.co/W3YmxSH42u
91,This article contains misleading claims. It is true that the Russian central bank was against crypto initially. The Russian gov clarified however that they are pro crypto now and are working on (rather restrictive) regulation (for its citizens).
92,This dependency is what Russia is likely aiming to eliminate sooner or later. https://t.co/ydTvklfeSq
93,"@hexeract01 It would be a very bitter pill for Germany since they shut down their nuclear program in favor of gas imports from Russia. They may end up supporting this sanction however, at least temporarily, given the war."
94,@alphaazeta And they were sharing regulatory news shortly before the attack.
95,@runasand @gluk64 You probably want to use @ProtonMail instead of gmail. For your own digital safety.

98,"Also, have folks forgotten the Turkish invasion on Cyprus in the 70s ? Arguably, this is European soil as well."
99,"Media outlets claiming that, quote ""this is the largest attack that we see on European soil since the second world war"". Have folks forgotten the Serbian-Kosovo conflict ? Including massive bombing of the US and Nato partners. Not taking any side. Just reminding."
