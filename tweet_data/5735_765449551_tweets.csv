1,ser @nothingnyc to see here https://t.co/GraGBrUiKn
2,Nothing screams eclectic like bringing all the degens to the The Arts Club.
3,"@joyceyyc The process differs according to each artist, but the authenticity of an artwork is verified in consultation with world-recognised literature and/or expert on each artist, as well as careful checking of the provenance (i.e. sale and exhibition history) of the artwork."
4,"@joyceyyc Not fractional and no auction - single sale. Each artwork is vetted rigorously by the in-house art specialists, with certificates of authenticity, literature, provenance and conservation reports verified and uploaded to the NFT Deed."
5,@nftnoobbby why I don’t talk with mine anyone
6,"it costs 25 ETH to own a Banksy 
and 190 ETH to own a Picasso https://t.co/TKVtrldlWa https://t.co/cvg7ni7SQV"

8,@crispylines can hear this tweet
9,@0xgaut tell them before crypto we had daft
10,"It might be that you are not into art, but a Picasso or a Banksy sold via NFT will never rug you - beats real estate when it comes to storage of value - backed by the real certified artwork, handled by a third party. No damage, shipping hassle or risk of robbery. DM to know more."
11,just because I identify as an NFT / jpeg doesn’t mean you can buy me easily.
