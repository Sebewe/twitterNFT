4,"@NateAlexNFT I get the sentiment and with staking situations I 100% agree, but I don't think the logic works with Doodles / Space Doodles - because of the way the NFTs are linked (i.e. if you sell your space doodle, your normal doodle is transferred along with it).

Just my opinion"

Its a slow grind but we are slowly assembling like-minded people and I'll be deploying the contract soon.

20,"@darksirious2 @BabaBrouk @Sothebys Yeah agreed, I just wonder whether the solid gold (and i get what you mean by outside collection), going for 500 in itself set a bit of a precedent - that one will always be infinitely rarer than the 5 1/1s. 

But of course as the project develops, so does the value....."
21,"@darksirious2 @BabaBrouk i don't know Dark, do you think the charity auction may have inadvertently set a ceiling?"
22,"@ASHinTheMeta Ah, actually I owe you an apology and a slight alteration: My non-optimised contract also withdrew reserved tokens; A better comparison below: They are basically the same

Optimised: https://t.co/7TZLMLEfaH

Non-Optimised: https://t.co/7TZLMLEfaH"
23,"@ASHinTheMeta in fact; I just had a look at how much it cost me to deploy my 2 test contracts (one non-optimised and one optimised):

My optimised contract cost me approximately 2.8M gas, my non optimised contract cost me approximately 6m gas."
24,"@ASHinTheMeta no, hardly any difference. Only difference is laziness."
