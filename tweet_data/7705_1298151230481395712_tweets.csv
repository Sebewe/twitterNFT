0,"@averybloom Telling someone what you think without providing any reasoning behind it (not just repeating) is akin to argueing regardless of what someone else says. Dialogue is hearing what other people are saying.

You were more of the former kind of personality.

NGMI 😌"
1,@averybloom Honestly it didn’t help that your partner could be heard yelling in the background you don’t get it 🙄
2,"@averybloom In my opinion, definitely. Granted you didn’t swear or scream which is better then most. That being said, you were extremely discursive about your knowledge level and what relation you have to tech and art. 

I wish I recorded the space to let people be their own judge. Next time"
3,@averybloom https://t.co/jCKJnfXzCv
4,"@averybloom Since you’re not even a beginner level artist it’s rich you judge what is good art. 

One of my uses of twitter is to call people out who can’t hold dialogues outside of text because to use twitter spaces it to reveal your emotion. I’m calm your raging. 

I’ll start a space 🙃"
5,@averybloom Maybe instead of complaining about jpegs that you think are dumb you should be working on your business and supporting the charities needed to help the Ukraine 👍
6,"@averybloom Says the person who can’t draw, hasn’t donated anything to the fight in the Ukraine, has a crummy at best website and business, and is worse at being a entrepreneur then a seller of jpegs?

See how that works?"
7,@evelynscrypto Buy your .eth name https://t.co/DEDJMruSpp
8,"Isn’t it great that most people calling artists in web3s creations trash when they can’t draw at all themselves. Seems like jealousy thinly veiled at best.

Like seriously. Telling a 10 year veteran of art their creations are bad art when they can’t draw more then a stick figure."

Calling good art bad shows how bad you are at being good at art :)"
12,@mick7192 @cryptocomnft @cryptocom Did you mean web3 members have donated over 50 million to the Ukraine?
13,@NFTherder You can tell how dumb NFTs are by how bad people have to right click them. So dumb that they spend all of their time right clicking on every single one 😌

17,"Just a reminder fam there is still not one person to date who says why NFTs are bad who is willing to hold a dialogue.

They cite self proclaimed experts not actual ones. They complain about the art when they can’t draw themselves. Most important they will never have dialogue."
18,Thank you for the work you do @NFTherder https://t.co/73MCImBzyE
19,"@AgentShawnee NFT haters must be amazing at doing backflips with all the mental gymnastics involved in refusing to hold dialogue, pretending everyone In crypto is a man, and lumping every chain, coin, token, and application as a scam while refusing the utility of a p2p decentralized ledger 👍"
20,@Xhakaed Unless they are using preexisting pokemon then in my opinion they all good 👍
21,@AgentShawnee Lastly. Explain the scam to me here. Someone in Ethiopia creates a digital painting and uses a nft on a carbon neutral blockchain to show ownership of the digital painting. I buy it and support them and their family. I have no intention of reselling it. Where is the scam?
22,@AgentShawnee We (as in the nft community) are the most active in twitter spaces as we are not the ones afraid to discuss the issues and have dialogue on the subject. It's a sad thing to watch you act as if you're the one in the light when you won't step out of the shadows in any way.
23,"@AgentShawnee At every instance you refuse to learn. You know they literally have entire conventions full of computer science experts who teach on the subject all day. I doubt you see how that goes against the claim ""they can't explain why they are useful""."
24,@AgentShawnee You have talked about royalties in the context of a pyramid scheme without any regard for the fact that royalties (and how they work) are transparent before a purchase if they involve a royalty at all.
25,"@AgentShawnee You seem to be torn between calling nfts in general a ponzi scheme and a pyramid scheme which are very different and unique things by the way. One involves promising to pay people back the other is a multi level marketing scam.

Not the same."
26,"@AgentShawnee I don't think you know what a smart contract is, as it works very different then a legally binding and conventional one. The point of them is to facilitate same time swap interactions on A CHAIN not THE BLOCKCHAIN. Also they allow for trustless decentralized trade."
27,@AgentShawnee You keep saying the blockchain. That's probably why people say you don't know what you're talking about. That and you clearly refuse to hold an actual dialogue verbally to be educated in as I have offered many times. You claim to have owned crypto. It's total BS show us the addy.

Stocks work that way. You know someone has to buy them from you for more then you bought them. So you think stocks are a harmful scam as well?

At least Eth has a framework for application where stock does not."

37,"Just a reminder to everyone that there is literally no one who does not like NFTs or blockchain technology that is willing to hold a dialogue about why it’s bad.

Sure, they make posts, videos, tweets, and the rest. The moment you ask them to hold a dialogue though… they bail 🤔"
38,"@AgentShawnee The claim about renewable clean energy comes from the place of spending less to run the consensus mechanism of POW chains.

Prove me wrong?

I think you meant pyramid scheme btw 😉"
44,"@novelhandle It would be easier to defend a specific issue. Like you said you have been talking about the problems for hours and I just joined. How am I supposed to know which issues I’m debating if you don’t catch me up. I just assumed you wanted more then a echo chamber 🤷‍♂️
You do you 😌"
45,"@novelhandle

48,@SergeantSlgg @AgentShawnee See @AgentShawnee let’s give the people what they want 😌
49,@SergeantSlgg @AgentShawnee Sounds juicy. Got a screenshot?
50,@AgentShawnee MLM schemes are pyramid schemes not ponzi schemes. Different types of scams that are not similar. Pos chains use no energy. The main POW chain uses less energy then Christmas lights. Supporting small artists oversees is very easy with nfts. You need open dialogue @AgentShawnee
51,"@AgentShawnee @TheSandboxGame @Minecraft @GodsUnchained @PlayHearthstone I know you won't ever have a real conversation about this for fear of looking silly but you know we could. Talos and Shawnee discuss the issues in a twitter space?

Nah probably won't happen as you are filled with anger and not willing to have conversation."
52,"@AgentShawnee You're not my enemy although you are misinformed on a lot of the issues. 

I wish you would stop calling an entire community cultists as that is literally the kinds of attacks you're complaining about.

If you were willing to have open dialogue then I would be wrong. Are you?"
53,"@AgentShawnee No the cultist attacks are when people, like yourself, refuse invitation to open dialogue in public so people can asses who is knowledgeable about a subject for themselves.

Wanna have a public dialogue? 

Will you refuse?"
54,@AgentShawnee @TheSandboxGame @Minecraft @GodsUnchained @PlayHearthstone You don't need games to use the exact same tech because they can be used for different things in different games. Yes I have seen exactly that happen. Also if you respond at least do it at the bottom of the thread to keep it fluid. Also lol is for laughing not raging :)
55,@AgentShawnee @TheSandboxGame @Minecraft @GodsUnchained @PlayHearthstone Items in any game would require that game to continue to exist for those items to continue to be used although it's worth pointing out that at least nft games sometimes have item backing and cross collaboration to prevent exactly what your complaining about. So you can move them.
56,@AgentShawnee @TheSandboxGame @Minecraft @GodsUnchained @PlayHearthstone People who want to own their stuff prefer to do it in a decentralized way where the game devs don't have complete control over what they sold you if they sold you it at all as you clearly missed the part about self creation.
57,"@AgentShawnee @TheSandboxGame @Minecraft @GodsUnchained @PlayHearthstone You don't need to ""waste energy by mining the blockchain"" (btw not how nfts or blockchains work) as it would make little to no sense to house items from a game on a pow chain so most games would use a pos chain although I doubt you know the difference."
58,"@maxrenke @omgchomp I play @GodsUnchained. A card game where all card ownership is determined by NFTs. Seems more then analogous to me seems exactly the same as a card game. Maybe you don’t know what your talking about @maxrenke.

Also on a carbon neutral blockchain 🙄"
59,"@omgchomp Honestly Shawnee has no idea what Shawnee is talking about. 

Watch - @AgentShawnee you willing to have a public conversation on the subject in a twitter space?

The same answer whenever you call out misinformation is what we will get. No."
60,"@AgentShawnee @omgchomp Clearly you have never looked into the royalty system. Creators decide royalties and they don’t go anywhere but to the creator. Gaming assets in NFT form have no royalty at all.

Just because you want it to be a pyramid scheme so you can cope does not make it so 😌"
61,"This thread seriously makes me head hurt. Misinformation and judgement overload.

@AgentShawnee wanna have a conversation about this technology which I’m claiming you don’t understand in a public twitter space?

Or is the latch to your echo chamber sealed shut?

Your move 😌 https://t.co/vGtlaKAB9Y"
62,"@AgentShawnee @TheSandboxGame @Minecraft @GodsUnchained @PlayHearthstone In addition one of the beautiful things about blockchains is that items from different games can be stored on the same blockchains or cross chains with inter chains 🙄

Tell me your more angry then informed without telling me your more angry then informed."
63,"@AgentShawnee The point of a NFT game, which you missed, is that the creators want you to own those things.

That’s why people prefer things like the @TheSandboxGame to @Minecraft or @GodsUnchained to @PlayHearthstone.

Playing a game without owning what you buy/create is the scam 🤦‍♂️"
64,"@AgentShawnee You - Spreads misinformation on the internet with tweets.

Me - Offers to have a dialogue in a public twitter space to help educate you.

You - Refuses?

65,@magicalmagii @unlikelylol Bitcoin does not support NFTs soooo maybe at least correctly complain about which blockchains you don’t understand.
66,"@unlikelylol Not equations and not on any pos blockchain and the POW blockchains that support NFTs use less energy then Christmas lights.
