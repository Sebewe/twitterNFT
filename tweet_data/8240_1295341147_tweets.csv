1,"Though this article has its flaws (ignores that chains are public and fully traceable, assumes govt can control crypto, ignores DeFi), I think it actually does a good job summarizing the relationship of crypto and war.

3,"@holyn The most common argument against Web3 is that it damages the environment. But no amount of Web3 participation or lack thereof will impact the amount of energy that the network consumes. It’s safe to try, you don’t have to feel guilty. People building it aren’t evil."

5,"@wongisrite Well, I think we’d already have troops in Ukraine if trump were pres… But they’d be helping Putin ransack the place."
6,"@0xGioMedici What if there are, say, 29 other people or organizations with 1% of the supply, that also hodl? What if it would take 1000 years for you to reach a dangerous percentage, is it still a concern?"
7,"@0xGioMedici Rigid rules don’t determine decentralization. Rules are subject to consensus on any blockchain protocol. 
See: https://t.co/NUOfVW89YK"
8,"@0xGioMedici I strongly disagree. I don’t think any regular users will be on mainnet in a few years. Likely to just be hundreds of rollups methodically consuming all the block space. Could prevent most MEV on L1, reducing staking revenue as well.
Base fee will go way up in $ but down in ETH."
9,"@0xGioMedici I agree, but if the consensus is that a change can &amp; should happen, it will. Same for Bitcoin, I could see it’s security becoming in jeopardy some day and a new monetary policy coming into vogue. It’s unimaginable now but may be inevitable someday. Adaptability is a survival tool"
10,"@0xGioMedici Idk if that’s true. I think what’s more likely is no one entity ever gets to any kind of significant proportion of staked ownership, and then the burn reduces supply to the point that acquiring a dangerous portion becomes financially and technically impossible.
Also: https://t.co/9sZpFU1s2e"
11,@Qexd Ok https://t.co/qNvyTqJhcm
12,"@0xGioMedici 5. Ubiquitous use of rollups will reduce traffic on L1 and reduce the ETH burned rather than increase it. 

This is all IMO, I’m no Vitalik lol. If I’m wrong please feel free to say."
13,"@0xGioMedici 4. If the burn rate can be proven to be damaging to decentralization, it can be adjusted. This isn’t Bitcoin."
14,"@0xGioMedici 2. Rocketpool is the only service I can imagine getting to 33% of staking power, and it’s decentralized. Might be ideal, actually…"
15,"@0xGioMedici 2. Earn rates are equal for all participants, larger share doesn’t mean disproportionate gains. (I don’t think you were claiming this but just to clarify)"
16,"@0xGioMedici 1. There’s a limit to how many validators can be brought online. Even if the top validator aggressively continues to reinvest in staking, idk if it would be possible to outpace others."
