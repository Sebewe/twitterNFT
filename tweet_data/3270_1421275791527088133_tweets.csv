4,"Wow, Pixelmon really set an all time low! Horrendous."
5,"It irrationally irks me when people say they spent X amount of dollars on an NFT.

You did not spend any dollars, you spent ETH."
6,@TheShamdoo It hasn’t even been a full 24 hours lol. This a massive historical event with permanent ramifications in the worst possible way. Just use your noggin 🧠
7,Swampverse Creature vs an Acrocalypse Croc. Which do you prefer? 🤔 https://t.co/uYvaybsG5Y
8,"If you were brand new to NFTs and someone gifted you a wallet with a little bit of ETH, would you rather they also include your name as an ENS or a random semi-valuable NFT?"

10,@hawksquawkgm This has been done many times and is more annoying than funny tbh 🤷🏻‍♂️
11,"1. Unable to mint a hyped project
2. Too broke to buy on secondary
3. Complain and FUD the project so people like you and me lose money (meanwhile the people behind the project still made a killing)
4. Repeat

NFT Twitter is weird."

They’re almost at a 6 ETH floor. Major L… but not my worst. 🤷🏻‍♂️

18,"This is chaos, man. I feel so bad for everyone affected.

Security is paramount. It NEEDS to be the priority for every single Web3 related company moving forward."
19,RT @_anishagnihotri: Revoke Cash by @RoscoKalis getting hammered tonight. An alternative redeploy I tossed up: https://t.co/X1iyGgTgdP
20,@opensea It’s always something.
21,Idk about you but the X2Y2 “airdrop” feels quite sketchy. 👎

You’re not creative."
31,@meta__dynasty So we are just gonna continue falling for the obvious scams? 🤔
32,"Usually a fan of @NFTethics but this “exposé” feels very incomplete. There are really no hard facts on why they are calling this project scam.

Thoughts? https://t.co/Rj6el3GjMx"
33,"NFT space is so fucking cliquey. A small group of people stick together and decide what’s good/bad in the market.

Excited for this to go away. We really are early…"
34,"@MetaRaccoon I could be wrong, but this is most likely a scam to steal your ETH. 

If it feels too good to be true, it is most likely too good to be true."

43,"Sometimes the laundry schedule and weather align just right to where I ""accidentally"" rock my MAYC shirt and sweatshirt AT THE SAME TIME. 🤷‍♂️"
44,Impossible to trust any new project these days. Great time to buy existing projects with a team still grinding and being transparent with their community.

65,@EddieVisual Pretty sure that’s exactly what @GalaxyFight_NFT is trying to do.
66,"What a sequence of events. I strongly disagree with Brantly’s beliefs but this kind of sets a wild precedent. 

Oh well, onwards and upwards! https://t.co/PfH1ltP7C6"

69,This Space turned into a hippie circle jerk of meditation all of a sudden hahaha what is happening 😂
70,Too many emotions flying high and too little valid arguments being brought up in this Space.
71,@DanVerno @farokh I understand his point but he is clearly too emotional to contribute at this point.
72,Morgan sounds dumb af right now in this Spaces 🤦🏻‍♂️
73,Weenie Hut Jr brantly.eth is here defending his whack ass stance loooool https://t.co/0azWNtWxpR
74,@betty_nft @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains It’s a shame that one persons shitty views have to represent an entire organization. I understand the decision tho
75,"@Chodan_Bakri @mothy_eth @DeezeFi He tweeted this and that it’s. No addressing what he said or anything meaningful. Just reiterating that he’s catholic and that “he loves you all.” 

Unless you’re gay or course! https://t.co/GuDZCXi3JV"
76,"Saying something six years ago is one thing. Standing by outdated, homophobic, and idiotic beliefs is another. 

Anyways, I hope your bags are pumping, anon! Let’s keep this space positive  friendly, and welcoming.😊"
77,"@Chodan_Bakri @mothy_eth @DeezeFi I don’t think it’s that he said it in 2016, it’s much more so that he still sticks to the same beliefs in 2022. Big dif"

84,@sohrobf Looks cool! Thanks for getting back to me. Best of luck moving forward
85,"@WrightWard2 This is very interesting, I had no idea. Thanks for the input boss"
86,@knuxponential True. In general it just feels like the wrong time to sell anything BAYC even though they have spiked considerably.
87,"@sohrobf This is a cool idea but unfortunately it has been done before. It seems any professional football league that tries to rival the NFL inevitably fails. 

What do you think makes your league different?"
88,"Heavily considering selling a Mutant to buy ~20 ETH of $LOOKS and staking it. 

Is this a good or bad move in your opinion? 🤔"
