Brantly had witherspoon.eth because the person who bought it offered it up. The same is not true for ukraine.eth; we literally have no more power here than any other ENS user.

30,@emmibevensee It's up to him to decide if he has a conflict or not. I don't control how Brantly votes.
31,@emmibevensee I have a clear conflict of interest here. I have opened a vote on my personal Snapshot if people who delegate to me want me to vote differently: https://t.co/3gD78DSSOy
32,@0xTycoon @ForSureNotHere They can be. The Snapshot message when you vote is misleading; you can make a subsequent vote and it will replace any previous ones.
33,"@0xTycoon @ForSureNotHere I have, but Snapshot allows you to change your vote any time before it ends."

39,@omprakashTN ❤️
40,@daylon_eth I think the latter would be far more corrosive to the DAO than the former. Brantly could (rightly) challenge the legitimacy of any motion to remove him based on that.
41,@daylon_eth People had weeks - with free redelegation - to change their delegation away from Brantly if they wished. I think it's a reasonable interpretation that anyone who remained either supports him or is indifferent.
42,"@daylon_eth I am, to put it mildly, not a fan of changing the rules mid-vote. I do not think any decision based on excluding his vote would be legitimate."

64,@feliciaday They're adhering to all the sanctions. This was a request to block *all* Russian citizens from their platforms - which would affect thousands of innocent people.
65,"@__padpad @avsa It's pretty straightforward - just buy it when the price is right, then transfer the registrant at https://t.co/54Se2E14up to their account."
66,@transmissions11 @r_ross_campbell 🤝
67,"@r_ross_campbell They're more or less useless as extensions, because you can't guarantee they'll run. See ERC721 for instance, where nobody uses hooks because people don't use the 'safeTransfer' methods reliably."
68,"@r_ross_campbell But an ERC20 with 0 decimals is still a fundamentally different thing to an NFT, because it's still fungible. It makes much more sense to use a different function signature, so these two things can never be accidentally confused."
69,"RT @ensdomains: Hey frens! Could you use a gm? We could too.

70,"@r_ross_campbell What doesn't make sense is using the same 'transfer' signature or event signatures as ERC20, when 'amount' and 'token ID' are fundamentally different things.

Hooks, 165, etc, are all improvements that became available after ERC20 was final; no sense in ignoring them."
71,"@peter_szilagyi Just measured ours - 50mm x 35mm, side walls are ~2.2mm, but variable because it's a complex profile."
72,"@peter_szilagyi Personally I would ignore the advice and get aluminium joists that are wide enough to accommodate two boards with a gap. That's the system we used, and it mirrors standard deck construction."
73,@intocryptoast @peter_szilagyi He said in another subthread that he's already obtained deck jacks.

79,"@r_ross_campbell If you wanted to have one NFT per contract, sure, they're basically the same. But a contract with n fungible tokens is fundamentally different to one with n different NFTs."
80,"@r_ross_campbell Augh. 721s problem was trying to follow ERC20 *at all*, not that it wasn't sufficiently close to it!"
81,@intocryptoast @peter_szilagyi Not alu over timber - alu over plastic deck jacks. No timber involved except for the decking itself.
82,"@intocryptoast @peter_szilagyi Aluminium will give greater strength for a given dimension, which is crucial here."
83,"@peter_szilagyi I don't think that's very practical with most systems - deck jacks are big, and boards mostly come in random lengths, so they won't all end at the same spot."
84,"@peter_szilagyi I am not a structural engineer, but I think you're right; it mostly matters for having enough width to drive the screws in. You need it to be wide enough to accommodate two sets of screws for where one board ends and another begins."
85,@AppletonDave You ain't seen nothing yet. https://t.co/ERx6AUYVBz
86,@peter_szilagyi It looks like our aluminium framing is 35mm high. I'll measure the thickness with calipers when I can. 30mm seems doable.
87,"@Amxx I kind of agree - but on the other hand, charity auctions clearly work."
88,"@peter_szilagyi Oh, that is tough. The system we used only goes down to 78mm; after 19mm for the decking and ~30mm for the joist, it doesn't leave much for a deck jack.

What sort of jacks are available to you?"
89,"@peter_szilagyi There are existing systems designed for building floating decks; I used Modas, but there are others. Using a dedicated system if you can get it removes a lot of the complexity."
90,@peter_szilagyi My first piece of advice would be to go to a place that sells deck supplies and ask them for a design and quote. They'll probably do it for free to sell you the materials.
