42,"@pejamv3 @BoredApeYC @psychedelic_nft @NFTMTG @CatBloxStudios There are many investors in the industry simply wanting to understand why holders are so bullish..heck, perhaps we're missing a decent investment opportunity.  I know little about the founding team or project raison d'etre.  You're not alone in being bullish ♥️ Have a great day!"
43,"@jennythl_ I tried to educate myself and learn more about the roadmap. 🤯😢

https://t.co/BnIXt18P7y.  ."
44,"@pejamv3 @BoredApeYC @psychedelic_nft @NFTMTG @CatBloxStudios 👆 you've kinda provided a dictionary definition of 'hype' and all I was looking for was project education. Let's not fall out or have a 'cat fight', we're both @CatBloxStudios after-all.  

Good luck with the project, mate."
45,"@pejamv3 @BoredApeYC @psychedelic_nft @NFTMTG @CatBloxStudios That's awesome!  I love the project...the art is great, but many of us have just seen the art and not a lot more.  You're chatting about 'movements' and 'narrative-shifting' initiatives.  I, for one, am super excited about that.  Enlighten us."
46,@pejamv3 @BoredApeYC @psychedelic_nft @NFTMTG @CatBloxStudios @BoredApeYC and @psychedelic_nft all have charitable causes close to the projects.  I don't think it's fair to chastise anyone commenting on $1.3m for an unrevealed NFT being a notable occurrence in the industry.
47,@pejamv3 @BoredApeYC @psychedelic_nft @NFTMTG @CatBloxStudios which brings me to your suggestion of IF being a 'movement' — some profound connotations with that word.  Enlighten me and the many others who haven't seen anything other than some awesome art.
48,"@pejamv3 @BoredApeYC @psychedelic_nft @NFTMTG @CatBloxStudios Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater — all money raised for registered charities is awesome.  I don't know the winner (congrats, btw),  I just find it difficult to believe that spending 500 ETH on a 1/1 IR was a mix of wanting to do the right thing and nabbing NFTs"
49,@pejamv3 @BoredApeYC @psychedelic_nft @NFTMTG @CatBloxStudios So...one draws the logical conclusion of congruence between the project and the amount bid...especially when the auction comes with six early mint IRs too.
50,"@pejamv3 @BoredApeYC @psychedelic_nft @NFTMTG @CatBloxStudios ...but I couldn't find a copy. If you had 500ETH for altruistic, charitable purposes then you'd want to know who you would be materially helping, no?  Otherwise, you'd just take your $1.3m and donate to a charity that directly resonates with you."
51,"@pejamv3 @BoredApeYC @psychedelic_nft @NFTMTG @CatBloxStudios Most hyped projects have a charity fund and any money raised for registered charities could be wholeheartedly commended.  Could you shed some more light on the RCC Charity Fund?  I couldn't find any details online as to which charities benefit, perhaps it's on the IF roadmap..."
52,"@JB__nfts I like to think of myself as a pragmatic, balanced kinda guy but this one has me completely baffled. Good luck to the project and the founder must be having an awesome day."
53,"@GoldSkull_PA @psychedelic_nft @InvsbleFriends That trade to me is incongruent.  I'm with @psychedelic_nft and @BAYC2745 for the long haul: strategy, game theory, art, community...trading that for a walking cartoon is not my vibe.  Not being salty, if they succeed it brings focus on the #NFT industry.  Good luck!"

55,@Onlytam2 @bricktopians I cannot wait for FORGE.  Don't we have something stupid like 800 bricks available to buy atm?  This project is so insanely under-appreciated.
56,@crispystonks I saw parity with HapeBeast — along with a few other similarities but that's another tweet.  After selling an unreleased 1-1 for a zillion dollars I now have no idea.
57,@MolenschotJnsy @MarkNFT That made me laugh.
58,"@axienfts @NFTMTG @BoredApeYC @psychedelic_nft @CatBloxStudios you do you, Axie....we're building a community of gamers pumped about entering the metaverse.  Sounds like you don't wanna come along for the ride...good luck with your projects."
59,"@Onlytam2 @NFTMTG @MatSposta @TNAKirsh Great question...the team is phasing things...P1 is getting battles going for Royal Gamers (exclusive NFTs and fire art).  Phases from there are really exciting and evolving as we speak.  You do you but I'm blessed to be in Bricktopians, MTG, PA, Asuna, Sloties and a few others"
