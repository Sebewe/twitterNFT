70,"And lastly, i wish to send out prayers and strength towards all citizens and unwanted people in war."
71,"It's time for Russians world wide to stand up against this regime, now even more then ever. dump your rubbles, get on bitcoin. abandon Putin, this stuff has been going on for way too long."
72,"Also, good to know for outsiders, Russia still has forced army time, most people there are kids (18+) which NEED to serve, they don't wanna be there, they did not enlist, Putin is just using his peons."
73,"I'm hoping for a miracle for the Ukraine citizens, I truly hope most are safe, but to be honest, Belarus (fuck that dictator) and Russia (and that one too) is almost impossible to fight off, in the long run, yes European countries are sending weaponry, but this is to late."
74,"Furthermore now it's easy to see, most countries like MONEY. It's sickening. there's been no 'real' sanctions. SWIFT would be step 1 to push forward. It hits both companies and Russia. You need unorthodox ways."
75,"Political take incoming, harsh. 

Must say i'm not surprised the weakhands of NATO  literally will do nothing to protect Ukraine.

It's simple: they are scared, secondly all sanctions are easy to call: weak. Because we, the Europeans are dependent on Russian gas."
