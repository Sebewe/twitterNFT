And lets close with the memelord himself:

Most of Elon's 75million-strong army might be following him for funny posts, but when he adds the weight of their global mindshare squarely to one side of the see-saw, its makes it even harder for Putin not to fall off of his side. https://t.co/ABT3zWctSq"
15,"13/
The huge power of people's beliefs and actions being coordinated online through memes on social media could then be what Putin's geopolitical masterclass has missed.

While nuclear bombs were the strongest weapon in War2.0, Meme bombs are the master weapon of War3.0. https://t.co/jEJZ3jgphy"

Meanwhile the normally pro-Putin regimes China, Hungary, Turkey and even Belarus, are feeling the meme earthquake and are being extremely cautious not to end up on the wrong side of it-

Zelensky used to be a popular comedian, and is able to navigate the meme game much better than the notoriously tech-averse Putin.

While the old-skool media manipulation through regional TV news stations and cringe photos ops worked well enough even in 2014, more millennials are globally in positions of influence now. 

And the game has evolved-

In 2021, internet memes created billions of losses for Hedge fund Titans.

And cute dog pictures resulted in a social media meme frenzy that took a joke digital coin to a valuation that would be incomprehensible in a pre-meme world.

What we may be seeing, is that the global mass adoption of social media has profoundly shifted the geopolitical landscape.

With such a shocking blunder from a master, we must wonder-

It's looking all but certain by now that Putin has miscalculated grossly in the Ukraine affair.

That will be small potatoes to the kind of corruption we will allow with CBDCs-"

Of course this story won't really end well.

It starts with giving governments more authoritarian power through the money supply, and we have seen signs of how that can go wrong in Canada already.

But this will be 10x worse at a minimum. And imagine the corruption side-"

If its Trump maybe his CBDC will give you discount on your next gun purchase.

And what if the government wants to force you to spend it to support a certain kind of business? 

They can program it so that there are only a certain number of whitelisted places that will accept your specific CBDC airdrop.

61,"10/ 
..And if they are very -ve, people will store the cash ""under the mattress"".

This creativity on taxes can continue, but they are ultimately a game that the uber-rich will adapt around.

Till now, the best to be done in this scenario is creative taxes that are redistributive.

Devaluation is also a politically more acceptable digestible method, because the savers that lose out can't see day-to-day what is happening, only when zoomed out.

But ultimately, currency devaluation will hurt the lower/middle classes, and thats where the next parts come in-"
68,"3/
There has to be a release valve, and if its not a traditional fiscal or monetary release to avoid recession, they will move to more extreme choices.

Ultimately, currency devaluation will continue to play a key role, as it lowers the cost of debt (both government and private)."

Central Banks and Fiscal Governments in 2022 onwards are in a tough bind- of their own making.

What to expect for the next few years if we do indeed get stagflation? In the 1970s version, gold went up ~60% per year 1971-1974.

Assuming devaluation goes back down to 8%/year and adoption continues at 5% a year, here are some rough fundamental (not price!) estimates."
93,"11/
W/ a 2016 base of $1k and ignoring Hard money utility, the estimated fundamental value at start of year were:

2016: 1.00 * 1% = $1k
2017: 1.08 * 3% = $3k 
2018: 1.17 *10% = $12k
2019: 1.26 * 7% = $13k
2020: 1.36 *11% = $15k
2021: 1.58 * 19% = $30k
2022: 1.83 * 28% = $51k https://t.co/UVmuNKcVYM"
94,"10/
So while the need for hard money has been relatively low for years, we could be entering a zone of exponentially higher utility.

While Gold is likely to do well as it traditionally does here, BTC will have its crack at being the new better version."
95,"9/
That is an environment that crushes growth equities, bonds collapse as interest rates have to get raised, and speculative assets run into a liquidity crunch. 

There are no certainties, but there are many signs that we could be entering such an environment imminently."
96,"8/
Hard money ultimately is needed as a safe haven, and there is a reason gold has been called this traditionally. In the 1970s when we had stagflation, gold exploded as hard money was needed desperately.

Inflation in the high digits, while growth in the economy stagnates."
97,"7/
This was the case in H2 2020 and throughout 2021, when fiat got devalued big time.

But growth equities kept pace comfortably, commodities of all sorts went up, and even bonds did fine. Not to mention altcoins.

Hard money was actually not needed bc everything else worked."
98,"6/
$BTC 's fundamental value is maintaining and transferring wealth, when is that valuable? 

If central banks are constrained, and international capital flows are easy, there is little value- People can just use fiat.

What about when the economy is overheated by money printing?"
99,"5/
And we get to 'Utility'. This is the one I find the most interesting. 

Ultimately, Bitcoin is a product. We know the Supply as it is mathematical based on miner emissions- but the Demand we have to judge.

There has been speculative demand, but that is not fundamental.."
