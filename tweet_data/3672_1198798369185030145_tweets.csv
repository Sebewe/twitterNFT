1,@NekiasNBA Haha. I chortled on that one.
2,@painter_crypto Gold.
3,@hammmer_ @NateAlexNFT No one will care next week.
4,@timmay_doubet @IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra You are trying to turn my point into an argument against you again. I’m not arguing against the fact that they get fouled. People view harden/embiid’s style differently from Giannis because of the way they try to draw fouls. That is why no one hates on Giannis having a high fta #
5,@timmay_doubet @IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra When have I said they weren’t getting fouled? You are trying to argue with me about something im not saying.
6,@timmay_doubet @IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Seriously? Just move on. If you can’t acknowledge that they have different styles and that embiid and harden flop around more to draw fouls there is no point in continuing this.
7,"@timmay_doubet @IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Its how they are perceived though, and that’s the point. You can feel it’s ridiculous but the original tweet is a complaint on why no one goes after Giannis about it and I am simply saying that it’s the style in which he plays that is different from embiid and harden."
8,@timmay_doubet @IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra We are really doing this again? You are making an argument against something I’m not saying. https://t.co/dpZJ1Pe1Nf
9,@timmay_doubet @IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Did I say anywhere that they weren’t getting fouled?
10,@NotZainAgain Gotcha. Didn’t follow initially.
11,@NotZainAgain Comparing to what though? Two very different projects with different objectives.
12,@GiannisNewEra @TrolledByHarden @HardensBetta @IcyEmbeast @Danizeh Man I hope the Harden stans don’t ruin Embiid for me.
13,@GiannisNewEra @TrolledByHarden @HardensBetta @IcyEmbeast @Danizeh We really got the Harden and Embiid stans teaming up to call Giannis the flopper?
14,@NotZainAgain How did it make BAYC owners look smart?
15,@HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra @IcyEmbeast @Danizeh Haha. Why?
16,@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Jumping into a convo to not address the point of the convo is an interesting strategy.
17,@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Because you continue to make an argument that is irrelevant.
18,"@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra My god are you dense. That, yet again, does not have bearing on my point. It’s the STYLE of their play and HOW they draw fouls that is different from Giannis that makes people feel it’s cheap."
19,"@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Ok. Well then, again, you missed the point and continue to not address what I was actually answering."
20,@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Put that comment on the context of what he said…
21,@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra You are making an argument that has nothing to do with why Giannis doesn’t get hated on when he goes to the line a lot in a game. You keep telling me about Embiid abut it has no bearing on my point. I am answering why people perceive Giannis differently from embiid.
22,@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra This is what you responded to. https://t.co/dpZJ1Pe1Nf
23,@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra You are making an argument against me buddy. Not the other way around. The problem is you are arginine a different point that has nothing to do with what I said.
24,"@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Yeah. Great. The 20% drawing fouls is, again, why he gets that treatment and Giannis doesn’t."
25,@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Again. Not the point.
26,@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Stop with the casual nonsense… That’s a cop out.
27,@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra You keep missing the point. It’s not about what I think. It’s how they are treated - the question he asked. Being good at drawing fouls (merchant skills) is why people hate on him and not Giannis.
28,@IcyEmbeast @Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Great. The “good at drawing fouls” part is my point.
29,@Danizeh Not me. I’m actually answering your question.
30,"@Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Great. That isn’t the point though. Giannis doesn’t try to draw them like a merchant, so people dont hate on his FT attempts. People foul him as a strategy!"
31,@Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra Read my previous tweet as to why that happens.
32,@Danizeh No. I’ve watched a lot of Harden and Embiid to understand their game. Last night has nothing to do with the comparison you made.
33,@Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra I’m responding to your point on why no one cares when Giannis gets to the line a lot.
34,@Danizeh I don’t care about last night.
35,@Danizeh @HardensBetta @GiannisNewEra I’ve seen the video. The difference in play style is why no one comments on Giannis. Embiid and Harden TRY to draw fouls often as their scoring tactic in cheap ways. Giannis gets fouled because he constantly attacks the rim without the flopping. It’s the style difference.
36,@HardensBetta @Danizeh @GiannisNewEra Because it’s true.
37,@Danizeh @squaresense You proved his point.
38,@Danizeh Giannis doesn’t flop around and draw cheap fouls.

44,"@todayodious Per one of your previous posts, I’d love to see less cute pfp projects moving forward. I think that style has been saturated and people are ready for some creativity. First new look/idea that’s great will do so well."
45,@PlungeFather @Deadfellaz @thehundreds Haha. Feel the same. As an almost 40yo parent I just can’t pull off some of this merch.

58,@DuncanSmithNBA American players don’t like that foreign players are the best in the league right now. Old heads can’t grasp that. It’s honestly embarrassing.
59,@BurnerStan69 @LindorHOF @TheHoopCentral But he’s still right.
60,"@el_pureagua @Three_Cone This is such a dumb take. Giannis can’t really bully people now due to flopping… and if you don’t think Giannis can shoot mid range or play in the post, or that he’d just adapt to the times because of his brain, you just aren’t smart."
61,@Smaug55 @ThunderFanIsaac @Three_Cone The surely aren’t calling all those dumbass charges on Giannis…
62,@days_dubs @JJMaples55_MST Xenophobia. They also are threatened by the fact that Giannis might end up a top 5 player ever.
63,@cobie The expectations were bad… the reality is somehow so bad that l’d buy it just for the lols.
64,"@flippen6485 @andy8052 For sure, but the talk was that liquidity was the liquidity was going to dry up for a long time, not 12 hours."
65,@andy8052 Everyone was talking about the liquidity drying up for a long period and it was a 24 hour bear market... It seems like NFTs are not as illiquid as they once were maybe?
66,@MichaelVPina It would honestly be well deserved. His stats might not rank with the top 3 but Derozen’s had a more magical season than all of them.

85,"@itsmechase @beaniemaxi It’s a weird situation. Beanie is probably where a lot of the original minters learned of PV, so the OG holders don’t feel as negative about him. He’ll lose that little benefit though if he continues this hate. Feels like the start of a downward spiral for him to be honest."
86,@NotTheDrPhil @ape3593 Yeah. This is the wrong one to point out. It’s a the equivalent of a mint vial anyways… the complainants were always 721 reveals.
87,@NoTechBen When did that happen? This is the first I’ve seen if an injury.
88,"@hmfaigen @NekiasNBA Everyone should just pay more attention to Giannis, the king we need."
