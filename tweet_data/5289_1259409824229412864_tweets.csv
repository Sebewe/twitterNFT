1,What projects are coming out in March that I need to keep an eye on? 👀
2,@WeatheReportNFT https://t.co/VaeWQ78zcE
3,RT @Banks: Me describing Opensea and the process of minting NFT’s 7 years ago https://t.co/wHmPT6Bp3A
4,@HappyHomiesNFT Yes! Education is key! 🔑
5,"(5/5)
I wanted to see what were some reasons for not wanting to learn about NFT and see if I could help address them to get more people into the space. 

Thank you to everyone who responded on the last post."

In the end a user would learn:
- How to set up a wallet
- How to buy crypto from an exchange and transfer to a wallet
- Mint a NFT from a site
- Post a NFT for sale
- Purchase a NFT from a marketplace"
7,"(3/5)
I created a Rinkeby Testnet contract and mint site for people to learn and experience the process and allowing them to use their wallet but not have to risk using real money"
8,"(2/5)
Users complete each step and are sent an “achievement” NFT which is a NFT created on Polygon for free.

Once they receive the NFT they use CollabLand to verify and gain a role to access the next level"
9,"(1/5) Reason for last post

I’ve started a small project and community to help my local community get into NFTs. But want to reach out to more people. I created a game in Discord that helps walk people through getting started with NFTs"
10,With the market like this now do we see less projects being pumped out and more projects working on innovation and evolving the space 🤔
11,@EcotopianNFT I personally don’t hear this one as much but it does seem to be something people are bringing up 🤔
12,@CrazyScribble1 WL is a another topic in itself haha. I’m looking forward to how we evolve how a project gets their holders. I agree a diverse community and holders is an amazing thing to achieve for a project 👍🏼
13,@andieshore Like the amounts we trade NFTs for or people actually using their paychecks 😳
14,@eddycarra_ This is exactly what I’ve been trying to share with people. Anyone can make a NFT with art. Very few people look at community and value behind the art. These aren’t just JPEGs…they’re so much more
15,@KemuriKey Ahh very interesting take.  Never thought of it like that 🤔
16,@AlbertPurnama This new tech is completely different from what we’re used to. I think learning how to use a wallet and understanding what it is used for is a great first step
17,@CrazyScribble1 Do you think majority of project are welcoming/inclusive to new users?
18,@pupnsuds22 @Forty4Four44 True. With all these stories of rugs and cash grabs. It doesn’t put NFTs in a nice light
19,@Old_Chokes Yes money is a big one. What would you say is minimum investment into NFTs?
20,@defibae This seems to be the big one right now
21,@iam0berly0 Headline media does not paint a great picture for this space. People miss out on the underlying tech of all this. Thanks for the share 👍🏼
22,@Forty4Four44 I know money is one of the big ones. I actually started a community with people where I live and showed them how to use Rinkeby Testnet to get them to experience how the ecosystem works. But I agree with being afraid to invest $$
23,What’s one thing you think stops people from entering Web3/NFTs/Crypto?
24,@AlbertPurnama RTFKT’s pod system. I think that’s what it was called. But those Pod X spaces that people got dropped.
25,Looking to start getting more into Blender again. Want to learn how to create some cool assets for a Loot Pod 🤔

I'm guilty of just clicking through signatures and confirmations like T&amp;C and just hitting ""agree"".

I feel there will be copy cats of similar things happening and I hope we take this as a learning lesson. I know I have and will be careful to what I'm confirming."
27,"(1/2) 
Just my thoughts on the latest news:

Did the phishing scam take advantage of our bad habits? Having been in the space clicking and confirming wallet transactions I feel have become a normal thing. Especially when trying to snipe a rare NFT or public minting a NFT"
