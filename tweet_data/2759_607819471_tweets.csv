4,@sodasNFT ayo what’s this these are cute af
5,@Leigence wow so true. i wish you could put a filter for like “3 good votes” or something so you don’t see the spam.
6,"have patience as people try to process this. 

it’s a unique and terrible moment in history and most of us have never had to process something like this before.

have empathy for those hurting and try not to shame those who don’t understand the gravity of this moment."

39,"@PetBerisha @Marklar18073947 @1FightingIrish @zoescaman this is for sure false. corporations won’t want to give this up (like Actvision), but game devs are already embracing this. there’s tons of gaming projects in the NFT space atm."
40,@Marklar18073947 @PetBerisha @1FightingIrish @zoescaman …they DO guarantee that you will always be the owner regardless of the decisions of companies / games (like in this example). whereas if WOW shut down today you would just lose everything with no chance of recovery or future utility.
41,"@Marklar18073947 @PetBerisha @1FightingIrish @zoescaman the difference is with a decentralized protocol you could always fork the games code and recreate it. also your NFT will always have inherent value as a collectors item even if no one recreates the game. decentralizing things doesn’t guarantee that they always have value, but…"
42,@damedoteth thanks for the share here it’s always great hearing your perspective. sorry about the circumstances in which you had to write it!
43,@EnlightenedLime explain it to me
44,"@libevm @rainbowdotme na, chill"
45,@SandorReport @dam_greta @mikedemarais i’d say 95% of my timeline isn’t blocked and i am following strictly CT at this point lol could be just the people you follow 😅
46,@dam_greta @mikedemarais pronouns aren’t she/her btw
47,@damedoteth this is probably the dumbest fucking point of that dudes article… like no one made money off of this?? it’s just blatant misinterpretation of events for clicks
48,also come from a similar background as dame. christian echo chambers are rough. you can change opinions though. i did and dame obviously did.
49,ens delegate votes =/= more money in someone pocket. it’s just voting power. the entire argument that cancelling brantley was for money is literally just not understanding how DAOs work lol https://t.co/j5pk6dCpjS

57,@maxmiester27 broooo i was just replaying through this the other day. it’s fun bc i forgot all the puzzles now lol
58,@JustKrakens wow finally welcome 😂
59,@rexwhamming @EnlightenedLime @BrantlyMillegan this is exactly it.
60,"@EnlightenedLime @BrantlyMillegan he didn't get cancelled for being catholic. he got cancelled for being a bigot. lol

being anti-LGBTQ+ isn't a necessary catholic position."
61,@chriswallace NFTs started covid
62,@LEIGHTSHIFT what is peoples obsession with gatekeeping lol
63,"@1Bprice i figured it was sincere tbh, due to knowing how you tweet 😂 but i wasn’t 100% sure."
64,"@1Bprice really not sure what the exact answer is, but i mean it starts with not allowing these people to continute to spout their hurtful views. would be helpful if they could all be convinced otherwise or re-educated or something but idk? it all sounds dystopian when you spell it out"
65,@1Bprice bro. regardless of the tone it’s a great question haha. i mean i really do think a good course of action is what happened with brantley. don’t give people who are sexist / homophobic positions of power where they can hurt people with their shitty views.
66,"i was in church for most of my life, and have a degree in both theology, and biblical studies:

you can be catholic (or any other sort of christian) AND be fully supportive of LGBTQ+, scripture does NOT require intolerance

being a hateful asshole is a personal, conscious choice"
67,tolerating those with intolerant views is a fallacy.
68,@PARABOLIT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains errrr remember how brantly doubled down on his statements proving that they are his current held beliefs?
69,@UnderGCrypto @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains he doubled down on them and proved that the statements are his current beliefs lol

93,"@CozomoMedici depends on the intention. some are obvious cash grabs, others like expansion punks try to take the og algo and nostalgia and add some diversity to it for a good / fun reason. hard to tell without taking a look at the devs and culture around the projects."

95,"fr tho idc what u think, deadfellaz deserves the world. can’t think of a better dev team rn."
96,@kmalaev17 @vernalkick something tells me you are also not on the design team lol
97,@nolanhummel @DiamondEyesFox @BellyFlopClub @zerobeta the point is that with decentralization a game could never be “obsolete” you could always fork the repo and recreate it. plus the NFT you own never goes away. it’s forever on the blockchains and has inherit value.
