70,@DarrellPilant @APompliano I use Coinbase Commerce on my Shopify site. Super easy to set up.
71,"@Chris_arnade Yes, this is upstate NY. Rust belt towns with normal neighborhoods split up by huge swaths of empty land or decaying factories. It’s so depressing and why I rarely return to my childhood home."
72,@benroy__ Just finished it last week. It won’t stay with me like Fall but it was fun to read.

77,"@austinkleon @okido_official We still read ours from 5 years ago. The poop and pee edition, specifically."
78,@TheAmberPicota I’m an enneagram 4 and that’s why I’m so sorry about it but it is so hard

81,@kevinrose @AlchemixFi @scupytrooples Enjoyed the episode but wish I had a better sense of how much I’d need to put in to break even with gas fees.
82,@kevinrose @modern_fi Loved this episode. I’m a newbie and appreciated the round-up of things you bought recently. So much out there it’s hard to filter.

94,@jamiebgolden Come on up to Athens. Our Walmart has openings.

Anything by Neil Stephenson - they haunt me."
98,@lauratremaine I don't think they want him to be their leader as much as they wanted to say F you to the establishment. Still shocking.
