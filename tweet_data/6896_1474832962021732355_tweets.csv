There is video evidence online, too gruesome to share. There has been a bloody civil conflict in the Donbass for 8 years, proxy war b/w West and Russia."
3,@BlockGeekDima @enensaa Attacking Russians in NYC is inexcusable and evidence of an extremely effective propaganda machine in action.
4,"@gshekriladze @BlockGeekDima @enensaa That may all be true, but how is the Ukraine the model democracy all of a sudden? Frm 2014, overthrow of elected government, integrating fascist militants into govt and national guard, bloody armed civil conflict, etc. Putin and West taking advantage  at expense of Ukrainians."

34,"@Linklevosstwins Yes, he was right. You’ll NEVER hear me defending Putin and his cronies under normal circumstances, but when the Davos/NATO/neoliberal elite funds “democracy” in UA, this is an unfortunate part of what they are funding."
35,"@Linklevosstwins The Ukrainian government likes to downplay their existence and has absorbed them into the national guard and “depoliticized” them. But they’re still there, and have been committing atrocities in the Donbas for years. Don’t take my word for it, just read up on it my friend."

98,"@staringispolite @0xcacti @TornadoCash Huh? How can you do this with CEXes? They require KYC in most places, no? So the CEX has and knows your identity, and has tied it to the CEX wallet and therefore linked with your other TXes. If there’s one entity I dont trust when it comes to privacy preservation it’s government."
99,"@0xcacti @TornadoCash Exactly. It’s a bit flabbergasting that @TornadoCash is not more commonplace. Saw that @GetBlockWallet is integrating wallet UX with @TornadoCash or something akin to it, but it’s all surprisingly obscure. Like you I feel it’s an absolutely integral part of crypto."
