80,@johnmacdz @AAAddict_ @noncoducks Seems common for any of the projects I’m part of that pay out monthly rewards. The bungalow exception actually helps me max out my total monthly rewards as well. And you can always elect to not follow and not get the rewards. Especially early when payouts won’t be much.
