2,I missed the mint for @reli3fxyz but snagged these 2 up on secondary. $1 million+ raised in a matter of seconds from the NFT community for the people of Ukraine is truly amazing. Shoutout to all the artist and the team for making that possible. https://t.co/ZQz7rSFOaS
3,Shoutout to @BoardApes for this amazing piece. Truly breathtaking😱🔥🦍👑❤️

6,@ByHardy Oh woah holding a .1 floor. Okay Super Yetis!😂
7,"@finnickmedia I didn’t do it cuz I didn’t get the WL? Lol had I got the WL I would have. So I’m asking the community who was able to make the flip, where are the established project purchases with those gains? Don’t think anything was “lost in translation”."
8,@finnickmedia Hell yea I wanted a free 10 ETH to buy into established projects?
9,@ByHardy Tbh they should each buy 1 ETH of Misfits and Yetis. #ForTheCulture
10,@finnickmedia I’m watching established projects volume vs a brand new project that just opened at 10 ETH? Lol
11,@ByHardy You saying that’s what I’m tweet says? I was giving examples of established projects that have shown development for the noobies that just came up on 10 ETH that plan to stay in the community. I even don’t own any Cool Cats or NFT Worlds.
12,"Alright where are the Gutter Cat, Cool Cat, BAKC, NFT World, or BYOVerse purchases at. Ya’ll just came up on 10 ETH in a matter of seconds. Put that into some established projects."
13,"@BlueBadger2600 The .08 slow, organic growth = happier people in the long term. 
Pretty hard to keep hype on a 10 eth floor off the rip. People love to get burned by these. Ex: Hape &amp; Meka."
14,"A bunch of 10 ETH purchases for a brand new project? Stop it. 
Congrats to the those sellers. Now use those profits for real project."
15,Soooo uhhhhh who’s got an extra WL for @InvsbleFriends just layin around for your boy?😂
16,@slmnewton Completely a late night degen move. Sooo NFA. DYOR😂

23,@BobbyBananasNFT Bought more $looks last week? Cuz same.
24,"@GetBackInBlood @GooniezNFT @LivesOfAsuna Lol let em burn in my wallet I guess🤦🏼‍♀️ Biggest loss ive taken in this space. Gonna keep my big bags for projects I truly believe in. BAYC, GCG, BYOP, and maybe a few others I’m forgetting rn."
25,@JakeNFT @GooniezNFT Dinos are at 0 so I be will HODLing all 97 of mine forever.
26,@NFTFLUME @GooniezNFT Feel like I haven’t been on Twitter or checking the space in weeks lol (it’s only been a few days). Missed a lot I see.
27,@JakeNFT @GooniezNFT I didn’t mint. And I don’t have any. Plan to buy post reveal when floor drops like nearly every project does. I was just making the original tweet saying I hope they don’t rug so I can see a reveal😂
28,"@JakeNFT @GooniezNFT Tbh i don't think it's a rug, i just think the false demand they portrayed is wrong. Creates an artificial floor. So once reveal happens and there isn't actually this HUGE demand. OG minters and secondary buyers are pissed and dump. But the art is 🔥😂"
29,@JakeNFT @GooniezNFT Ohhh i know its over half paid followers lol. Stupid of them to drive fake hype like that but it could still end up being something.
30,@BallaBMF @GooniezNFT Lol probably. Just hope they actually reveal and people dump just so i can have 1 in portfolio.
31,@AlexanderFNFT @AntonymNFT Looks like paid followers to me. Doesn’t mean a “fail” just simmer expectations maybe.
32,"If an NFT project or NFT person has 50k+ followers but less than 20 people I follow follow it, I just assume they paid for those followers and the project doesn’t have the hype it appears."
33,Full update on this. No surgery is needed. Still super rattled but physically going to be okay. Gonna be sore for a few weeks but ready to get back to this space in the coming days.
34,Update from my accident. I haven’t been on Twitter much since. Here’s the car. Waiting to hear back from the doctor. I’m alive and walking around. Thank you ALL for your kind words. Amazing that so many people care about someone they don’t actually know personally❤️ https://t.co/vP2JfEotkn

45,Anyone hosting Super Bowl Squares for the NFT community? 0.01-.0.05 ETH per square?
46,@NFT_Shooter Buying real cards is almost a guarantee negative EV. But there are still millions are do it. Since Topshot introduced flash challenges it’s been a lot of fun.
47,"@NFT_Shooter Topshot is no longer an “investment”IMO. I watched my account go from $10k to $120k last year and dip back to $12k. I all but gave up on the platform.
However, I enjoy basketball and the NBA. Once I realized it’s not a means of making money but pleasure. I love it again."

50,I’d like to thank @coop_nft for the alpha on this bet being available. The bet is now off the board.

72,Can these annoying people at least write this in a funnier way? So tired of reading the same recycled joke. https://t.co/SkxxRlEDf2
73,@CarlosGuimaNYC I was just running thru the wallet that has a warning on it that this mutant was in at one point and it looks like the person who lost it gave out his seed phrase or something of that nature cuz his account was whipped.
74,Soooo Open Sea flags NFTs from compromised wallets after the thieves already ran away with the money which screws over the real buyer ANDDD they have the exploit what is causing countless NFTs to be sold under market value. Open Sea you guys are killin it🤙🏼 https://t.co/aP8TmovQAk
75,@CarlosGuimaNYC Yea OS has some other tickets they need to get to before they get to ours about this manner but it sucks. Don’t want to relist on Looksrare and screw over the next person now.
76,RT @WillieNFT: @T_BALLER6 This was me👋 This Mutant fell into my lap through a collection offer on @LooksRare as well. This is another probl…
77,"@boredapebot Another day, another story. 
Someone just accepted this WETH offer i made via ""entire collection"" on LooksRare anddd it is flagged on Open Sea. Whoever originally flagged it and this is yours, get in contact with me. I will hold it for the time being."

79,"TLDR;
To those affected:
-Be patient 
-Open Sea knows they are in the wrong
-Open Sea has the funds to make this right
-Open Sea will make it right
-The ball is in their hand to make things right or they will suffer in the end  
Also know that the community is here for you.

80,"Open Sea should be held accountable for this &amp; to the credit of Open Sea, they have seemed to claim responsibility for these sales by refunding those affected. It is somewhat a lengthy process to get those refunded &amp; may take a thorough investigation into each sale to verify 7/8"
81,This is something that has happened because of their website and it not including the proper tools to allow users to not get exploited like this. There are some computer jerks that have the back end data in open sea to get these NFTs for pennies on the dollar. 6/8
82,"In the past, people have lost their NFTs due to their own negligence including clicking links, giving out seed phrases, etc. These old scenarios had nothing to do with Open Sea and they were not and should not have been held accountable. However, this is different. 5/8"
83,"Now why is this important?
In the last week there have been countless NFTs exploited that have sold well below their current values caused from Open Sea's back end data that was not visible to their users. 4/8"
84,"To summarize that total: they have sent 12,500 to coinbase in the last 3 weeks alone and are sitting on 44,000 eth + other tokens. 3/8"
85,"Just in the last 21 days they have sent a total of 12,500 eth to a coinbase wallet (i would assume to swap to fiat).

4000 eth 12 days ago

I was never a fan of the phunks but I dont mind people in the community buying these projects. The reason I dont buy into these “knockoffs” is cuz I don’t like the ‘creators’ profiting."
