6,"The ONLY valuable ""alpha"" group you can find is the one you make for yourself here on Twitter, follow + notification on the pillar of the space and most importantly block rug project that RT other cash grabs etc (most cash grabs are made by a small circle of con artists, run)"
7,"The best tips i could share is to spend time reading what blue chips did right and what cash grab are doing wrong in order to spot red flags before minting 🗑️. Also never FOMO, you have plenty of time, and if in doubt trust your guts go to the next one."
8,"I had this question a few time in my DMs: 
""could you give me a good alpha group ser ?""
First i'm not an expert of any kind i just share along the way what i learn (W &amp; L), but keep in mind that ""alpha groups"" are here just to pump the bags of the group owner + friends &amp; family."

30,"@Vangogh_wifey @AlexOffman @koonimalsnft @NYDoorman They divided the mint price by 3+ after this thread, there is no team, only red flags.

60,"@boop @leftwhaleshark @MarkTheHabibi @InvsbleFriends calling people sus or scammer really is a shame and not web3, i though the art was cool before but tbh the team is really not + a lot of things about this project.

68,"@MarkTheHabibi @boop @InvsbleFriends they""fixed"" it to avoid any bad press (by changing final white list...) but ngl many other have been duped and will not get a fix because they don't have reach / certification... not good

79,"Apparently @InvsbleFriends team will add you to their whitelist after calling you a scammer, but only if you have a big reach on twitter (also a certification might help).
