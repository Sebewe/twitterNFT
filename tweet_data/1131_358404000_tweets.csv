23,"So rn I’m just starting from basically scratch on a clean pc build. 

As sad as it is, it’s also kind of liberating and it’s thrust me into a creative overdrive. Wrote 4 beats this weekend and 3 pieces of art. 

Also my computer never been more organized than it is rn 😂"
24,"Tbh it’s been a tough week. 

I lost all my music + art files from this past year due to 3 hard drives all getting fried at the same time last week. The backups even got fried lol 

Currently shipping them to UK for last ditch effort of data recovery. 
A lesson learned obv."

61,RT @mattmedved: Behind the smoke and mirrors @justinaversano https://t.co/cdU9I47GCC
62,"@tomeriksmithart Yeah I think it happens at all stages in creative endeavors, this same thing happened to me with my music when I was trying to force / chase success on that front too"
63,@BaeliensNFT It really is about the journey not the destination!
64,"8/ I'm hoping these growing pains lead to new growth, to better art and to a deeper understanding of myself and my creativity, but it's been hard not having art as a real outlet lately. 
Anyone else going through this?"
65,"7/ It's difficult to play when there's a whole career attached to it. It becomes work. 
I don't really know what the answer is, but I've been trying to lean into the playfulness of my creations, to give myself fully to my art."
66,"6/ I still feel this way most of the time. It's an interesting paradox when creativity and freedom create success, and then that very success stifles the creativity."
67,"5/ I began to question what success really meant to me. 
I became paralyzed, like a flower - picked from the wild and placed into a vase, I felt stagnant, stared at and unable to escape."
68,"4/ As time passed, as more successful moments happened, as more money came in - I started to realize that my passion for creating art was dwindling. I was more paranoid, more stressed and it was harder to create just for the joy of creating."
69,"3/ At first it felt incredible - my dreams were finally being realized, and so much self doubt left me. 
The validation of others carried me high. My years of grinding everyday were finally paying off. I was finally making art full time."
70,"2/ I was caught in the initial wave of NFTs. The right place at the right time. 
I was plucked from my small life of creating, and my art was placed on a pedestal and shown to the world for all to see. 
I never had so much attention and validation before in my life."
71,"I want to touch on a topic that's kind of hard to talk about. 
Lately I've been struggling creating art for myself. 
In the beginning I created it for the joy of it. It was play, not work. Even at the start of my NFT journey it was about creating, community, and uplifting artists"
