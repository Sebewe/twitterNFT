94,I see opportunities to build instead of gamble in these markets - I will be building with my team while the markets mature. Web3 has only just begun - it’s insane what is going to happen over the next few months. Super excited for 2022 web3 projects👏
95,"There are endless business plans and applications for web3, I think as more entrepreneurs enter this space they will struggle on what they want to build bc there are so many endless opportunities. Once mass adoption hits - web3 businesses are about to be insane 🚀"
96,Web3 will change the entire world. If you chose not to build now you are sacrificing one of the greatest opportunities of your lifetime. Build or die trying - I think the worse outcome is not even attempting to build in the space.
97,"Building will always be more fulfilling than investing - and if you disagree you’ve most likely never built anything before. Think about it: investing is building other people’s dreams, but building is when people will invest in your dreams. Plus, it’s significantly more fun👏"
