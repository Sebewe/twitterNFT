60,@ColinOfMoon_ Done
61,@NoSpinWT Nice👌🏼not even the Tigers noticed it apparently
62,@NoSpinWT Best logo in the world. Enough said https://t.co/eBvS4BgxFx
63,"@NoSpinWT It’s like the logo wants to be a magpie, just call the team the magpies and be done with it, all this tip toeing is stupid. This team doesn’t deserve the Tigers name."
64,@Anthony_Wiggle When Vegetarian restaurants have a meat option on menus.
65,As an old Balmain 🟧⬛️ Fan I take my hat off to @SSFCRABBITOHS they showed everything that my team didn’t &amp; look at them now. Well done bunnies well done. Good luck on Sunday. 🐰🏆 @russellcrowe
66,"@hill_oval Members should have voting rights! They’d probably get more memberships that way, but the the club would become accountable &amp; they wouldn’t want that now would they??"
67,"Who’s @WestsTigers Russell Crowe? Without Rusty the bunnies wouldn’t be the team they are today! Tigers can never &amp; will never compete with the top teams. Mammoth changes needed, the likes of a takeover/ownership @WestsLifePod"
68,Tell me @WestsTigers why don’t members get any voting rights?@WestsLifePod @BecharaRob
69,@WestsLifePod @BecharaRob who is the person/persons constantly leaking stories to the media?  If it’s who we think it is how the heck are they still employed?? Perplexing 🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏻
70,Dear Mr. @JustinPascoeWT @leehagipantelis do you think it’s good management the way the club is being dragged through the mud AGAIN? Doesn’t it bother you both that we are the laughing stock of the @NRL
71,No matter how shit Balmain were and are Im embarrassed that we are linked to Wests tigers. They represent nothing that our club once stood for. Wests should De merge go to CT lose the tigers name &amp; lose Leichhardt ground…. Good luck
72,"@JockLant @finn_phineas @MCarayannis @brentread_7 @NRL Which club made the Criteria?
Wests or Balmain? Answering your question Wests have all the money &amp; for that reason I’m saying breakaway &amp; keep your unmarketable magpie logo!"
73,"@BecharaRob Honestly what is the point?
The club hasn’t cared for the fans or it’s members for a long time!seriously I’m at the point now why should I care for the club that has total disregard for us?"
74,"@finn_phineas @MCarayannis @brentread_7 @NRL No not really, It’s becoming an embarrassment! The Wests part of the merger destroyed their previous Magpies team@&amp; now doin the same to the Tigers! All they care about is poker machines and Sunday roasts! They couldn’t give a rats about the Tigers! It’s obvious"
75,"Give West Magpies their  overrated South West Sydney fan base, give the Tigers back to Balmain get Benny to back a 2nd Tier Balmain Tigers Team. Then let’s see who fans really want? Balmain Tigers every day of the week without doubt."
76,@MCarayannis @brentread_7 Wests Ashfield may be funding the @WestsTigers &amp; calling the shots but they have no idea &amp; are way out of their depths. The tigers were competitive when BalmIn had more of a say! Wests were always shit &amp; will always be shit. Rather follow a 2nd Div Tigers team than current.
77,@MCarayannis @brentread_7 As an ex Balmain fan I think it’s time to part ways. Give Wests Tigers their team call them Wests Magpies move out to Campbelltown &amp; F off. Give Tigers back to Balmain &amp; in a few years when magpies fall over the @nrl will beg for Balmain Tigers back in the comp.
78,"@telegraph_sport @MCarayannis IF TRUE!! What an absolute disgraceful decision yet again by the weak, pathetic &amp; useless @WestsTigers board &amp; CEO, it’s obvious who the cancer is at the club &amp; we are just leaving him them to reign his mediocrity ethos into this club while stealing his wage. Shame on you Tigers!"
79,https://t.co/VCGdRZIRFB @wswanderersfc @SydneyFC
80,"@samguarrera @BecharaRob Very accurate, Nailed it!"
81,"@BecharaRob Everyone knows it’s The inner west! Centre of excellence is in Concord, home ground should only be one &amp; it should be Concord! Western Sydney belongs to bulldogs &amp; Eels, can’t use Tigers in same sentence! Start to accept the inner west."
82,@lordofwar2014 @BecharaRob Awsome podcast absolutely brilliant &amp; revealing! Just in my opinion Teddy was never ever going to stay regardless of money as he wanted to win a comp &amp; staying at Tigers he wouldn’t of been able to achieve &amp; be the player he is today. Now about the Campbelltown delusion🤔
83,Quite a few ex @WestsTigers players playing semi final footy🤦🏻 @WestsLifePod @BecharaRob
84,Can you imagine when the @WestsTigers CEO called Ryan Papenhuyzen into the office to say “sorry mate we can’t see your future at Tigers” #NRLStormManly
85,@BecharaRob @balmaintigersfp @WestsLifePod And all of Parramatta’s points came from penalty kicks.
86,"@BecharaRob @balmaintigersfp @WestsLifePod Was at the final, I even got the match ball, remember taking the ball to school the next day &amp; playing tackle footy on concrete playground. Great days!"
87,https://t.co/t79SHsL7Ab @balmaintigersfp @WestsLifePod @BecharaRob
88,@WestsLifePod Why do we ignore the inner west all the time though? SW Sydney is covered with Parra &amp; Dogs! To think we wouldn’t lose a huge volume of fans if we move to Campbelltown is crazy.
89,@WestsLifePod try luring a young star to play for your team &amp; you can go to a club near beaches and city or head out to Campbelltown??? Never never forget that this club would never of existed without the help of BALMAIN 🟠⚫️ nothing wrong with the inner west!
90,Great podcast @WestsLifePod buy you &amp; the gents seriously promoting full time at Campbelltown? So sick of hearing the SW of Sydney is the future. @WestsTigers are building a Centre of excellence at Concord &amp; they now want an academy at Campbelltown 🤦🏻
91,"@FOXNRL @MarkDFStJohn Not coach! Look at back office, that’s where you start. Another coach change, another shit season but guess what CEO stays! See the issue?"
92,@1170sen Or could it be that the useless  board &amp; CEO cant attract star players? Changing coach will do sweet FA but changing board &amp; CEO is the tonic Tigers need! At what point does the back office get judged?
93,@PlansRjp @Ryandally08 @FOXNRL @leehagipantelis Bring back Harry &amp; @MeritonGroup as the major sponsor! Harry knows a thing or two about business &amp; can easily spot &amp; remove the fakes!
94,"@FrankArruzza I watched it, he’s going to be something"
95,@NSWHealth @GladysB How about you document all the cancer diagnoses that were caused due to every other medical procedure being cancelled &amp; ignored! Shame on you.
96,@telegraph_sport @BuzzRothfield Can’t they both be great?
97,"@Ryandally08 @WestsTigers Other clubs talk about Manu, Smith &amp; Tigers talking Woods 🤦🏻"
98,@JamesSilver3 @BuzzRothfield Let me guess…..Buzz wants his mate Flanagan to get the job
99,Seriously is there a dog plague in Sydney? More dogs than humans!
