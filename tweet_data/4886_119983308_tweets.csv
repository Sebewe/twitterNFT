I think for all of us, it just became a matter of it not being a top priority + not having enough time to organize and do the logistics needed to make it a good show."

9,"@magdalenakala It’s all in the phrasing. Super helpful tool to save everyone time. But the phrasing let’s you know whether they’re offering it as a tool and open to alternatives, or whether they are imposing a power dynamic on you and expecting you to work around their calendar."

19,@dtrinh @Delta Thanks buddy. Rebooked on another airline tomorrow and will eat a night at a hotel before making the drive to our destination the next morning. More the principle of how badly Delta handled it.
20,Anything Delta is going to do to compensate for that?  Didn't the government bail out the airlines with $50B during Covid? I know some was used to buyout pilots -- wouldn't mind them buying out my lost trip costs. #deltaairlines
21,"@Delta Meanwhile, there is a nonrefundable home rental and car rental (3 days of lost $$$)...not to mention lost time. Wait time to get a representative to even text with (not even a call): 86 minutes. #deltaairlines"
