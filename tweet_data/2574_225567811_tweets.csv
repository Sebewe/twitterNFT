10,@zscuffed nice collection there!
11,@trashBird13 @BoredApeYC one of us! one of us! one of us! 🍌🖤
12,@ShrewdCharlie thinning out from the projects that dont bring real utility except for the REAL ART focussed ones would be the first step - and everything looks like we are heading there. PFP collections will have their place if some substantial and sustainable value is generated.
13,@hyperspacez @BoredApeYC places*
14,@moses23__ @opensea you better get your sh*t right! this is not about clicking phishing links anymore as it looks like so its time to take responsibility and act accordingly. otherwise plattforms like @LooksRareNFT might find their spotlight.
15,@moses23__ man! dont wanna imagine having to deal with that B$. Opensea flaws really flourishing this spring. wish you all the best to get this solved - never get discouraged! praying for a fellow ape 🍌🖤🧪
16,@hyperspacez @BoredApeYC this mutant is going placed! very nice and welcome 🍌🖤🧪

31,@adutchbro your mom gotta be fumin'! 😆 imagine apes one day dropping to 0 then everybody gonna have that feeling on every nft. 1 million on an ape illustration? dont be too hard on yourself we all spent big bags on shit either way 🖤🙏
32,thx for all the answers and offers 🙏🖤 gojnna get back to you until tomorrow the latest. appreciate it!
33,@theterpyone happening way too often lately. people should focus on getting educated about asset/wallet security and general how to stay safe in the web. mostly happens due to phishing links and i just cant get over people still falling for that... specially with such valuable assets...💭
34,looking for some animator to crisp of my mutant in motion! anyone in my follower list that is in that field or knows someone? 🤝 paid ofc 🖖
35,@kartrud_eth @BoredApeYC best of luck on your flippin' journey! should documentate that will interest a lot of people if you can trade yourself up with such margins. keep it up 🍌🖤🧪

40,@NizzyNFT audience targeting for the most 😆 baiting the kids
41,@0xJedi @the_x2y2 @tp_x2y2 @LooksRareNFT well those control mechanisms are a double edged sword. decentral =/= control - yet i understand some of them are good and nessecary. but its not everyones vision of web3. main focus lies on the people not get baited by phishing links. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ASSETS 💭
42,@ApeTamu @ArtKaroon9 @BoredApeYC this guy looks ready for web3 lmao 🍌🖤🧪
43,"@ArtKaroon9 @BoredApeYC very clean pal! gz on the cop!

44,@JRNYcrypto @PlanetXOLO @JRNYclub nice animation! who did that if i may ask? 🤝
45,@OGDfarmer @boredapewood doxxing is debetable in a web3 space. we need to demand sharper frameworks around which projects gonna be valued as acceptable. too many red flags overlooked due to general FOMO - not healthy for the space. ☠️
46,@vinesdao Chapeau! Seducting me with my own ape! 👀
47,"@nftgerry but to answer the question, keep the salt comin but dont ruin your own meal 🙏🤝"
48,"@nftgerry people gonna be people. check them off your list and move on, some f*cker$ never gonna be thankful no matter what you do for them."
49,@ShrewdCharlie best of luck pal 🙏 standing in for your family is a big big move - you will get back there! after all its still just pictures and assets. some things matter more than that. bless you on your journey sir. mad respect!
