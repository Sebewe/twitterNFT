7,"@aoxborrow @nicksdjohnson Perhaps another good argument for an English auction in the future. With Dutch, you're immediately revealing the max price you would go (or at least somewhere around the midpoint or higher I'd guess). Where as in a ""regular"" auction you only reveal your minimum bid to start."
8,"@nicksdjohnson In my opinion, the average person has never heard of a Dutch auction and struggles with the concept at first.

https://t.co/cSSKdqeo51"
9,"@nicksdjohnson I would only push back on the ""simple to understand"" bit. :)

On the surface it is technically very simple, but it's also very easy to misunderstand the high starting price as some sort of gouging attempt by ENS, when that's not the case!"
10,"@nicksdjohnson Especially since when you register through the ENS manager, your Controller and ETH address record are automatically set to your address in the same transaction, which is not true if you buy a name from a third-party marketplace!

Many people miss this"
11,@aoxborrow @enstools @ensdomains serenae.eth
12,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @smith77778 @MAB @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains 6/6 However, with all that said, in the *meantime*, I think the only good solution to address sniping is to correct our current Dutch auction model to use an appropriate starting price. With abundant reasoning in the UI as I've stated before too!"
13,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @smith77778 @MAB @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains 5/ But in order for this to work, it also should be easy to use and low-gas for the user. Maybe an L2 solution there, not sure. But that is going to take months to build, verify, and audit, and it WILL be complex and more bug-prone."
14,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @smith77778 @MAB @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains 4/ Functionally it's the same outcome, but emotionally it's much different for most people, I think."
15,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @smith77778 @MAB @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains 3/ The main difference is that with a Dutch auction, there aren't really ""bids"", there is just one sale when the price comes down enough and that's it. 

So people *feel* like they ""never got a chance"". But they did have a chance, it's just that it was out of their price range."
16,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @smith77778 @MAB @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains 2/ @nicksdjohnson is right in that the ultimate outcome would be the same, it just goes to the highest bidder.

However the optics are so much better, people know and understand this format as what a ""regular"" auction looks like."
17,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @smith77778 @MAB @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains 1/ I am open to the idea of an English auction in the future, and here's why."
18,"@garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @aoxborrow @ForSureNotHere @smith77778 @MAB @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains I disagree, there is also no sniping in a Dutch auction IF the starting price is far above what anyone is willing to pay. Am I wrong?"
19,"RT @BrantlyMillegan: hey @TayZonday, welcome to .eth. i'm developing a vision. i just registered chocolatename.eth. you wanna work together…"
20,"@spikewatanabe @futurealisha @nicksdjohnson You're not pitting multiple contenders against each other *yet*, you're just deciding who you would like to see in the race. So I think it makes sense for one person to vouch for multiple potential stewards, especially since ultimately not one but three stewards will be elected."
21,"@spikewatanabe @futurealisha @nicksdjohnson Yeah, just semantics but...

""Should Spike Watanabe be nominated for the Meta-Governance steward election"" is one proposal on one snapshot space, and

""Should Bob Jiang be nominated for the Meta-Governance steward election"" is a separate proposal on a separate snapshot space"
22,"@spikewatanabe @futurealisha @nicksdjohnson I think the nominations are not really ""voting"" but ""vouching for"" someone. So one person can vouch for multiple stewards.

In the actual election that wouldn't be true I assume."
23,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @spikewatanabe @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 6/6 Like: ""1 MILLION DOLLARS?!?! ENS has just been taken over by greedy devs!""

Try to preemptively address the complaints that I can already see coming."
24,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @spikewatanabe @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 5/ I would propose expanding on ""ensure everyone has a fair opportunity"" in the UI as well to make it clear why the initial price is so high. Maybe explain what a Dutch auction is, link out to a core team blog post / wiki articles / etc."
25,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @spikewatanabe @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 4/ If the goal is to eliminate sniping, raising the starting price of the Dutch auction will certainly do that.

However, I'm also worried about the optics here. People will accuse ENS of being greedy/etc. without understanding all the reasoning behind this decision."
26,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @spikewatanabe @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 3/ A regular English auction was also proposed, but I don't think that would have any different outcome (the highest bidder would still win) and would add a lot of undue complexity."
27,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @spikewatanabe @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 2/ No premium just means that sniping still happens, and whales still win by using high gas premiums that go to miners instead of the ENS DAO."
28,"@nicksdjohnson @garypalmerjr @spikewatanabe @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 1/ Upon reflection and reading through all the discussion here, I agree that the current Dutch auction is still the most fair solution we have so far."
29,"@garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 6/6 But I'm not sure the above scenario is common enough to really worry about. I've dealt with many more support cases where the name hasn't been sniped, it's just in the decaying premium state, and users are taken aback and confused about why it suddenly costs so much."
30,"@garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 5/ So the name might still have a premium in that case, it would just go to miners instead of the ENS DAO."
31,"@garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 4/ And another side note, even if the manager UI did allow users to Request to Register before the grace period ends, if a wealthy person *is* attempting to snipe the name at the same time, they would still probably be able to win just by putting a ridiculously high gas price."
32,"@garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 3/ I think the premium was appropriate for the time it was introduced (https://t.co/oTSgtGcwna), at the end of the registrar migration window. But is it still appropriate now?"
33,"@garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 2/ If the namespace is overrun by speculation and not actual use of names, then that doesn't help anybody, and will be *more* harmful than locking poorer people out of sniping names."
34,"@garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @MAB @ensdomains 1/ To be fair, I can see @nicksdjohnson's side too, he's also thinking about the long-term viability of the ecosystem, and ensuring that rampant squatting doesn't happen IS very important."
35,"@nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @garypalmerjr @MAB @ensdomains 6/ Anyway I think with or without a premium, it might still make sense to allow the Request to Register to happen before the grace period ends in the UI, as @BrantlyMillegan suggested. As long as the UI is clear and people don't get confused thinking the name has already released"
36,"@nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @garypalmerjr @MAB @ensdomains 5/ A higher premium means more revenue for ENS and *maybe* less squatting, but also more hurt feelings from the community when they think they're going to be able to register their name and then get slapped with that premium screen."
37,"@nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @garypalmerjr @MAB @ensdomains 4/ I suppose the premium DOES mitigate squatting, simply because it only allows the wealthy to squat, cutting more people out of that opportunity. Is that mitigation really worth it though?"
38,"@nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @garypalmerjr @MAB @ensdomains 3/ And if the price comes down to a range where multiple rich people can afford it, then you'd *still* have the same issue where one using the manager UI would be disadvantaged when compared to someone invoking the smart contract directly."
39,@nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @garypalmerjr @MAB @ensdomains 2/ An extremely high premium that declines from $1m *essentially* just means that you are extending the grace period out until the price comes down enough such that the RICHEST person who wants the name can now afford it.
40,"@nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @BrantlyMillegan @garypalmerjr @MAB @ensdomains 1/ I feel like people are GOING to race for names no matter what, a premium doesn't stop that, as we've seen.

A $2k premium just ensures that only the already-rich have the privilege of racing for those names. The higher the premium, the greater this effect I think."
