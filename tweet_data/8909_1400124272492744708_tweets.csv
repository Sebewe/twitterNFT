FYI for tomorrow's chippi drop:

The sale begins at 8am EST, but it is likely that many of the chippi will NOT appear for sale on the main chippi page - you may need to click on the chippi to see if it is on sale. 

It is a bug, and I've reached out to @opensea for help"

94,@ToroTheDog @BanklessHQ @banklessDAO I take your point about crypto being risky. I agree - and even stablecoins have risk. I disagree that banks put your deposits in safe places. They lend it. I think 2008 taught us just how safe and conservative they actually are.
