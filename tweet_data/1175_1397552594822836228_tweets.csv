1,Special thanks to @LazyNFTs and @mcuban for providing a super clear way to check on my NFTs and make sure they were safe during the OpenSea and Etherscan outages yesterday!

4,How Minting 20 ERC721 tokens for $24 on Ethereum is possible with ERC721A v2.1 and the NOOBPUNKS contract: https://t.co/BVowwd4AWo https://t.co/RpUSo4KZN3

7,NFTCultureLabs published 2 new open source library contracts based on some implementations floating around on the internet. BooleanPacking.sol - for easy packing of bools to save on gas. MultiIncrementer - a gas efficient take on Counter in OZ. See: https://t.co/MKi8VJEpvE
8,"ERC721P and our ERC721Public both support burning tokens, which is a benefit compared to ERC721A. Gas consumption is comparable for individual mints at 70k gas. ERC721A will still allow for cheaper bulk mints, but at the risk of a more complicated implementation."
9,"ERC721Public features better formatting and comments, as well as an ERC721PublicEnumerable implementation that more faithfully implements IERC721Enumerable than the original ERC721Enum code from Pagzi Tech."
10,"Last night, NFT Culture Labs released its first open source project in Github: ERC721Public -- a cleaned up version of ERC721P (ERC721 deriviative originally by Pagzi Tech), based on the newest Open Zeppelin ERC721 release. See: https://t.co/JdyHfnKplL"

20,"@refikanadol @NFTCulture That sounds awesome, thanks for that tidbit, Refik."
21,"The Pagzi code is cheap for On-Chain calls but expensive for Off-Chain calls, but since off-chain doesn't use gas, this extra cost doesn't matter."
22,"So the Pagzi Tech team rewrote the contract to not maintain _balance. The OZ code that kept that array up to sync was expensive in On-Chain calls, but optimized for Off-Chain calls."
23,"Open Zeppelin's approach yields consistency across their ERC 20, ERC 721 and ERC 1155 contracts. BUT, ERC 721, because it only supports non-fungible tokens, does not need the ""_balance"" tracking to achieve its core functionality."
24,"What the Pagzi Tech Inc. team did is notice that ERC-721 Open Zeppelin tracks ownership of NFTs using two separate approaches, _owners and _balances."
