A permissionless collab in the Nouns spirit that ends right after Nouns officially goes mainstream during the super bowl

No space for hate in web3."
21,"@Jruffhouse @RTFKTstudios @Nike What if this lets you change your CloneX’s clothes?

It’s on Ethereum for a reason 🤷‍♂️

Maybe + the below amazing idea ⬇️ https://t.co/iCXbM8QEzM"

25,@CigToken @CryptoKingD @thecryptobeasts You found me! Upgraded
26,"@RockysBoulders I’m very long CloneX also. 

I think collection holders own IP and CC0 are the best models. I even think centralized IP control like LL can work fine as long as they aggressively put the IP to use.

Only wrong answer is centralized IP + passivity."
27,Strong endorse. This is the way https://t.co/kUxOua25OV
28,"@sergitosergito Undeniably crazy innovative and great executors. They don’t appear to do much else though 🤷‍♂️

I think intensely protecting IP + not doing much with assets is the only wrong answer, unfortunately."

32,@punk6529 It just so happens that the 1% disproportionately includes things of value
33,Web 3 is getting hundreds of thousands of dollars because you once bought a pair of shoes
34,"@WiLSONSACCOUNT Sure did! 

My buddies laughed at my Ethereum pitch January 2016 @ $6 an ETH 😂"
35,When @RTFKTstudios allows for clones to trade clothes it’s going to break the NFT pfp space https://t.co/M5P8Jo1mRa
36,@NathanHeadPhoto @RTFKTstudios tbh turning water into wine is super lame compared with turning a shoe order into blue chip NFTs
37,"The implication that those impacted by this change are the source of the “feedback” is ludicrous. 

Thinking of the artists and creators frozen out of monetizing their work and building their communities. https://t.co/tW89hW9JTt"

These two embody the strongest values of this web3 community. Bet on them."
48,@bambinodude @Chiptos_nft Cool as hell—I’ll follow closely for Chiptos X. Thanks for the rec 👍
49,Who’s got recs for dope 3D NFT projects/communities/artists??
50,Put some of my forever hodls into an absolutely ICE COLD hardware wallet and my god it feels good
51,"@ape9400 Great call. 

Long-lived parodies are super hard. They require a whole story + its derivative remain culturally relevant, which is wayyy more complex than most memes"
52,@bighatlevi @beefjenson Legends!! Safe flight
53,5 minutes into making my @RTFKTstudios x @oncyber_io space pod and it’s become obvious most NFTs 2022+ will be 3D

Play-to-earn sounds like 1/10th the fun of a normal game and 1/10th the pay of a normal job."
56,@jakeudell Rest up good sir
57,"@TheCryptoPeter @punk6529 I’ve been thinking about this too but rather than just tweet it, you actually put in some work. Kudos 👏! https://t.co/YOG23pQ6RP"
58,@sgsand1 @RTFKTstudios @clegfx Awesome theory
59,"Lot of these thoughts originated from encountering @punk6529 and @cdixon and all of you. 

Keep tweeting those ideas and helping others grow, everyone. 16/16"
60,"Because at the end of the day, the origin of most of the value is as follows:

Bored Apes: The meme
Punks: The meme
Nouns: The meme

The “how” is where they differ. 15/"
61,"So it’s kind of cool to see three blue chip projects with very different approaches on a key issue. 

There are trade offs and clear philosophical difference (which are super important to many people), but all can theoretically hold value (I’ve personally bet big on it). 14/"
62,"Nouns are even more purely embracing that philosophy. 

The CC0 approach takes value from memes as a given and says, “have at it, world.” 

Our memes are maximized by being culturally relevant, so why not remove the biggest barrier to getting it out there. 13/"
63,"This stamp isn’t worth $8m bc the owner can put it on shirts and sell them. 

It’s $8m because of its significance in culture and that it is cool to own. 

That’s CryptoPunks, and that’s most Bored Apes. 12/

https://t.co/KcGndrcJea"
64,"So what are CryptoPunks? They are the purest memes of them all. They are collectibles, analogous to the physical collectibles that have existed throughout history. 

Owning a 1st edition Charizard Pokémon card didn’t let you use Charizard in your business. 11/"
65,"But that feels low probability.

The value of most Apes will come from being recognizable as high-value, culturally-relevant goods and not from their individual business potential. 

They are memes more than businesses. 10/"
66,"It’d be BEYOND cool if the #BAYC became an umbrella brand for thousands of individual ape brands. 

Like next f***ing level. 

I hope that materializes. 9/"
67,"But while @LarvaLabs is the only one that can make money with the Punks IP currently, it’s worth asking to what extent that matters in practice. 8/ https://t.co/6xCLnbBlMl"
68,"Note: Shoutout @cathsimard_ for her super innovative #FreeHawaiiPhoto from this summer and @gmoneyNFT for being the buyer, releasing the photo to CC0 while compensating @cathsimard_ for her work. 7/"
69,"The @nounsdao structure has taken another (awesome) extreme, where all the IP is released to Creative Commons. 

You can make a business around your NFT’s IP, but so can everyone else. 

Feels a little strange initially. 6/"
70,"The CryptoPunks structure is on the other side. 

@larvalabs has gotten a lot of heat about retaining the rights to the Punk likenesses (though AFAIK haven’t enforced against owners). 

This eliminates creating a cash-generating business selling your Punk’s likeness. 5/"
71,"The BAYC structure let’s NFT owners build using the characters in their NFTs. 

Most don’t, but you can, and that 1) incentivizes making a brand out of your Ape and 2) creates a possible real business with cash flows. 4/"
72,"To many, the gold standard is what @yugalabs did with @BoredApeYC. 

Ownership gives you full commercial rights over your ape. 

Put them in a book? Go for it. Music video? Hell yeah. And collect those royalties on it. @jenkinsthevalet is crushing this. 3/"
73,"There’s a lot of great discussion these days on which IP rights should be conferred with NFT ownership. 

Full commercial rights? None at all? CC0? 2/"
