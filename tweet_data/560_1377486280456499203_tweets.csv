Hope some of the punk owners that I respect such as @punk6529 @krybharat and yourself can host a space for a better showing. Also, the immaturity of this particular seller doesn't help either."

50,"@MattBlofin1 This is too depending on data from the last 30days, most NFT projects going through hype cycles, especially new project, if u do the ranking now, invisible friends probably will be very high on your list. Suggest having some weighting factor to weight longer-dated data more. https://t.co/M3FeepiU3i"

63,"@punk9059 @DaCrazyBoredApe @ColinLieb I heard bout case before where rogue employee changed the website for a few hours, then it go back to normal."
64,"@punk9059 @DaCrazyBoredApe @ColinLieb maybe he got scared and stopped, what is risky is that it can be a rogue employee of a project and nobody would know, what makes sense is to be able to save/backup all messages u signed and compare notes between victims, don't think metamask has that functionality now."
65,"@punk9059 @DaCrazyBoredApe @ColinLieb I would call that phishing too, basically anything that you thought u were doing A, but actually u r doing B. With only like 30 ppl got affected, I feel it's some kind of smaller project, otherwise, many more ppl would be affected."
66,"@DaCrazyBoredApe @punk9059 @ColinLieb It's phishing, but not phishing through email, more likely signing something from some sort of minting or other site."
