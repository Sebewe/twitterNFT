49,@DefiIgnas @1inch ahahah yes
50,"7. To finish on a happier note, I'm less active in public these days but a lot of news are coming in the next few weeks about projects you know well and you should like it !👀"
51,"6. I thought that Paraswap could set up a good governance. In the end, we still have a governance controlled by the project team, despite all the goodwill of the community."
52,5. I also had several proposals that were to be posted in the next few weeks on the forum.I will let someone else post them and manage them for me since the team can decide who can participate or not in the governance.
53,"4. Their documentation is not clear on what they actually do with positive slippage: https://t.co/r7Ijas56jd

One question the community should also ask: should the team (with company funds in the case of Paraswap) vote during governance votes ?"
54,"3. I also found out that the Paraswap DAO was not generating any income from positive slippage and therefore no revenue. 
The company behind Paraswap keeps all the positive slippage (ironic for a DAO)."
55,"2. I am really saddened to see the direction Paraswap is taking, this is a project I have been following for over a year and I was just asking the team questions as a community member, they refuse to answer them clearly."
56,"1.A quick update on @paraswap, it's the last time I talk about this
I have try to discuss with the team in discord public channels but they don't really respond to my questions
I'm now banned from the Paraswap discord (welcome decentralisation🎉) and all messages has been deleted https://t.co/0xGZgCWZyz"
57,@paraswap @StarnyDeFi https://t.co/0rdcalKfvG
58,@humblealphashil @paraswap @StarnyDeFi Paraswap does not actually generate any revenue.
59,"@Le___Belge @cyrille_briere Merci à toi d'être venu 🥰
Effectivement on n'avait pas le temps de rentrer dans les détails de chaque type de tokenomics mais au plaisir d'en rediscuter lors du prochain meetup !"
60,@slashbin_FR @cyrille_briere Merci à toi d'être venu 🥰
61,"10. I didn't mention other strange actions made by the address, but you should look into it further on your side.

@paraswap is a project that I have enjoyed since its beginning, I am only saddened to see the turn of events."
62,9. - Why are the fees not redirected to the address provided in the doc ? (https://t.co/ZgDCl0mreu)
63,"8. Several questions remain:
- Can the team buy and vote with tokens from a DAO-owned address?
- Should the funds from Paraswap V4 go to the DAO or to the team?
- Should the team be involved in governance decisions?"
64,"8. I would also like to remind you that the Team will eventually own almost 23% of the total PSP supply, and they are still accumulating PSP to vote."
65,"8. I conclude that the team has embezzled funds owned by the DAO for personal use.

There is also the question of the decentralization of the protocol, the team voting with a large amount of $PSP, likely to change results of a vote, can we call this a DAO ?"
66,"7. In my opinion, from the moment the DAO was set up, the Team should no longer have to use the funds from the positive slippage, regardless of when they were acquired. This is also stated in the Paraswap documentation: https://t.co/r7Ijas56jd https://t.co/sHtcudJgkj"
67,"6. Moreover this address has bought $PSP between the 7th and the 24th of January 2022. At this time, the DAO being already in place for several weeks. https://t.co/WRMFcsa67b"
68,"5. But however, this address receives fees on Fantom, but Paraswap has been launched on Fantom only on January 24th, so it is impossible that Paraswap V4 is deployed on Fantom. https://t.co/FmhCNOJCWK"
69,"4. Mounir answers that these are the addresses collecting the positive slippage of Paraswap V4 dating from before the launch of the DAO of Paraswap. 

This is partly true, but why does this address continue to receive fees from positive slippage ? https://t.co/5EdicgnFUx"

71,"2. Context:

This afternoon I go to the Paraswap discord as a member of the governance (I'm also a discord moderator).

In the #french channel, @StarnyDeFi starts asking about a wallet that voted against the Paraswap budget proposal with 1.2M PSP and is making strange actions. https://t.co/8G9hnYkLhy"
