51,@mooneynft @AzukiZen holy shit
52,@UglyWook love that!! agree it’s so much easier for me too now being a mature age student! i received my first high distinctions ever last semester and i was finally like fuck yeah i got this now
53,@gunga_eth wow gunga that’s amazing! me too and i couldn’t figure out why tasks took me so long to complete. i found my school report cards the other day and it was pretty much my teachers indirectly saying i have adhd. thanks so much for ur support it means a lot as i rly look up to you!
54,@ofodile33 😭😭😭
55,"so touched by all of your stories that i am tearing up rn. i never felt like i could be authentically myself on a public platform, i would always censor myself and care too much until i started getting involved in the nft space. thanks for accepting me, your support is everything"
56,@TravelDany @ethacct WHAT! that’s incredible!!! fucking goals!
57,@cahwit thank you so so much for saying this! super stoked for your hubby!!! 💖

64,@metaladon you got this keep going 💖
65,@SempleThirley thnk u angel 💖
66,@chubbicorn80 @wabdoteth so proud of you! loving hearing all these stories of people going back to study as a mature age student. needs to be normalised imo 💖💖💖
67,@wabdoteth yeah lmao i just get like the “why are you at uni” thing a lot or ppl think i’m younger and so i wanted to clarify! i literally give no fucks abt ppls ideals i’m too old to care abt what people think. it’s taken me 29 yrs to finally learn who i am
68,@klentslogan @Ephi_BL that’s amazing!!! I AM SO PROUD OF YOU 👏 LFG
69,@ethacct incredible!!! thank you for sharing!!! 💖💖💖
70,"@Ephi_BL i am so proud of you ephi and everything you’ve accomplished, you’re an inspiration. it’s harder than ppl will ever know. my whole like i was told that i “had potential” and need to “apply myself” i had no idea i had adhd. i never understood why i couldn’t just be ‘normal’"
71,"now that i understand my brain better and i have my shit a bit more sorted out, i can focus on me and take the time i need w out beating myself up bc i now understand i don’t learn at the same pace as others. idgaf what people think… i am doing what i believe is best for me"
72,ppl ask me why i’m 29 and at uni. ok the reason cut short is bc i want to. i had undiagnosed adhd for 29 years of my life and study was always a huge struggle for me. no only did i not know what i wanted to do (changed degrees 3 times) but i just thought i was stupid bc of it
