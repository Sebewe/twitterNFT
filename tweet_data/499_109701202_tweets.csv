13,If you are holding nftx vault erc20 tokens you may as well stake them in the new nftx staking feature for free yield income over time.  👊 💰
14,"RT @danielgothits: we should do a Shark Tank NFT show, where 3 or 4 influencers do a livestream every week and people can come on to pitch…"
15,Kinda crazy because then you have p2p underwriting and reposession/slashing but this would be massive bc then anything worth money can give you passive income
16,Someone should make a protocol that lets you delegate collateral p2p and earn interest for that 😅
17,"As long as punks are seen just as a pfp their floor will not break 100e.  Once we collectively realize that they are virtual real estate, wealth generating collateral (nftx and defi) and historic artifacts then it goes above.  Wont be soon but maybe some day"

24,Like a manifest file explaining how to show vault holdings and yield earned
25,So then dapps can submit a thing which auto adds their dapp to zapper
26,@zapper_fi should come up with a protocol spec for services to submit a widget and contract addresses so the service can build the interface that comes up on zapper.  So i dont have to wait for you guys to manually add new ones.   Like xVaults in nftx

39,"What i have noticed as well is how when buying Flyz from https://t.co/CNZT9XurfS, most of the ones listed are from the NFTX vault.   So people buying flyz through Gem will most likely be buying quite a few from the NFTX vault and paying that extra small fee to xFLYZ stakers"
40,There is actually no downside and no impermanent loss from single-sided staking like this.  My yields are coming from people paying additional fees to buy particular flyz (handpick) out of the NFTX vault.  So my yields come from people nabbing 'rarer' flyz from the vault
41,"NFTX just added Single-Sided staking rewards (20% of all vault rewards) : https://t.co/klKDNYbVJ2

I've just staked 33 FLYZ so now i have 33 xFLYZ, an interest-bearing yield asset that earns $$ as FLYZ enter and exit the NFTX vault. 🧐📈"

81,Its completely unfair.  There is no way you could argue that the fees for money transmission alone could ever amount to anything CLOSE to total fees of all financial infra combined.   So its no wonder ethereum chain is far more secure with such a huge lead in fees paid to secure
82,"ethereum chain security is like a phalanx. Trad chains are monolithic and their security can never compete (see bitcoin) 

All of the fees that pay the miners dont come from the base layer (sending eth) they come from the thousands of microservices running on top."
