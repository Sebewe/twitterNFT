77,@tt03094194 快了， CV
78,It's all about following the right collectors. I probably 10x my nft value in 2021 by simply follow @TokenAngels. His collection will tell you everything. https://t.co/VdajZevipt
79,@TokenAngels Ser only when the crowd matures;
80,"@PopcornKirby @andy8052 Yes ser, meeeeee."
81,"@0xSuperior @degendata I kinda am expecting the wave of galleries, museums demand after NYC's Nft museum opens up;"
82,"@MM_185cm 我可以持續買賣Meebit到我60歲, it's easy on the eye for long term collection. Alot of them not."
83,"@Cryptocracy11 love u bruh, I hope it comes true. I got faith."
84,and watch digital toys take over physical plastic toys in the coming years.
85,"I will spend my 2022 as a Meebit. I will be heading into multiple verses with VR/AR/MR/XR. Print them out, wear them, use them as my Alexa avatar. Be active in community and enjoy the ride."
86,@SummerTimeFor3 @0xAllen_ Meepets is a guess. But I think possibly a Meebit village with bomb state of the art contract; possibly with traffic system/ fighting system. Something Fun for sure.
87,@jimmy_sjm Meebits floor is undervalued imo. 1. 3eth is cheap even for a Larvalab minting pass. 2. Interoperability in as Avatar/ Toy/Collectible with coming AR/ VR/ MR/CR applications.
88,"@0xSuperior I think we will, whales unload from time to time to balance their portforlio; 2021 punks rise from 900 wallet holders to 3400; I am guessing a 600~1000 wallet increase over 12 month in 2022."
89,@jimmy_sjm Only LL knows =) but you bet LL is creating something fun.
90,"@Shkwid I got a feeling most retail still thinks in fiat terms; Casually been initiating talks with watch collectors/ tea collectors, 240k usd now seems like perfect entry for a lot of collectors."
91,"4. 3d NFTs Mixed Reality public displays or Game avatars will enjoy the ride pretty well. The first versions of Mixed reality wearable will kick off more adaption. Imagine seeing @JohnOrionYoung JOY world Joys in public venues, or @Samsyyyy 's Jiometory."
92,"2022 Predictions:
1. Cryptopunks holders reach 4200, Floor price 500k ~750k usd. 

2. The announcement of LL's next project will take Meebits floor to 10 eth solid. 

3. Asia NFT collectors about to enter the scene along with Galleries/ Museums/ VCs"
