0,@tristan_todd_ Exactly. Agree with everything here. I also find that stating your confidence sounds more insecure..
1,@jokinmarc I think your work speaks for itself buddy! 😍
2,@welloffthetrack Probably a mix of both! Can't get away from Janteloven hahaha

24,@domenko Good thing I'm not alone! It just doesn't seem natural 😬
25,@hauglandphoto Maybe it's a Norwegian thing 😂
26,@MarcoGrassi_ I... Am... Very... Hungry for some foccacia!
27,@jamiewcraig Thank you Jamie!
28,@EricT_images Good thing you get to photograph it too!
29,"Just because you won't hear me say what an amazing photographer I am and how incredible my photos are, doesn't mean I'm not confident in my work. There's simply a certain lingo in not comfortable using about myself and my work. Maybe it's a Norwegian thing."
30,@EricT_images That looks quite amazing and unique! 🔥🔥
31,RT @yusupov_al: @CHoibergPhoto Just mint my first NFT collection 🎉 https://t.co/yrqNPinI6Z

37,Gm friends! What are you creating these days?
38,@J_BanksPhoto @Ukraine_DAO It's the least we can do🙏
39,@MetaJungleNFT I think this theme belongs to @sarahlyndsay_ 💛
40,"@tchebotarev It's a tricky topic imo... Personally, I'm not in a situation where I have anything to give. But I want to help, so the only way I see it possible is by giving 100% of the proceeds for my last images. I'm afraid it can come off as self promotion but it's the only way I can give."
41,@BriaudJoffrey That's fantastic! Congratulations buddy 😁
42,@zigmarillion Gm Zig! Hope you have a good one
