2,"@iamdstrk I don’t, but that has nothing to do with my comment. Plus no, Putin did not own Trump. And YOU seriously just love Biden so you won’t even acknowledge his inadequacies."
3,"@MOGStan Ha, No it’s not that at all, trust. It’s just that I don’t feel like wasting my time on having a conversation w/ you. You’re not even on my level intellectually and therefore a “rebuttal” isn’t worth it. I don’t know you &amp; you don’t know me so talking to you is a waste of time."
4,@MOGStan 😂
5,@MOGStan You’re proving my point genius. YOU “stop” not using your brain.
6,This is what happens when one leader thinks your leader is weak. Notice Putin never tried this until 46 got in… “sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon.”

9,Y’all ever notice that every time Biden speaks the U.S. stock market crashes?
10,He’d also make everyone of White House staff download his Stem Player or face termination by way of an Instagram post. #YeForPresident
11,"Also, he’s probably the only one who could ‘interrupt’ Putin from invading Ukraine. (See what I did the…. ahh nvm.)"
12,"At this point y’all might as well let Kanye be president… if Trump &amp; Biden can win, then Kanye can’t be any worse. At least with Kanye as President we’ll have a fashionable White House and everyone would be open enough to talk about their feelings."

51,@wintonARK Now I’m wondering what that “anger” response will be and looks like… hmmmm…
52,"@wintonARK Haha - touché. Truly, thx for this convo. 💪🏾 Continued success &amp; blessings to you and your firm."
53,@wintonARK Thoroughly enjoying this dialogue btw. Thank you for your insight.
54,"@wintonARK Well said! So question: do you think it makes “them” mad that they’re no longer the monopoly in that playing field? A filed once reserved only for “them”, is now being occupied by a bunch of “schmo”’s… does that “anger” them IYO?"
55,"@wintonARK Sure. The Government hates being left out of the party. Anything they can’t get their hands on, they tax. Which is the whole point of DeFi to begin with. It’s for the people; without having the government’s hands in our pockets."
56,"@wintonARK Ok fair. But what’s wrong with having a loophole for taxes with NFTs? Don’t the rich, wealthy &amp; Gov officials already do that with various other assets like homes, property, expensive watches, etc.? Do you see it as a problem/issue? Or are you just pointing out a fact?"
57,"The same can be said about digital money, and as long as you don’t sell, it too is a “tax avoidance” medium, no? I’m trying to understand your side of the fence here."
58,"Isn’t your find a huge investor in BTC? I’m confused. “Digital money” is the backbone of NFTs, and if I’m not mistaken ARK is a huge investor into said “digital money”, so how can you have a problem with NFTs &amp; not “digital money” in which your firm heavily invest in? https://t.co/CmUP9BDsgu"

61,Better question; did #Netflix’s employees actually watch the special before they decided to walk out? It’s clear to me they didn’t. All of this “backlash” actually proves Dave’s point to the T.
62,So did y’all actually WATCH “The Closer” or nah? 🙄

77,"Only in this world today will we fight over the vaxed vs unvaxed, but will do &amp; praise stupid shit like this which is equally dangerous. They’re saying she died, if so, why was this even a thing to begin with? We are beyond distracted. Is this not unsafe as well? #CrateChallenge https://t.co/mU93PulYJE"
78,"Schools are now sending out emails to parents saying that instead of the ‘Pledge of Allegiance’ or any other sort of prayer happening, there will just be a moment of silence in the mornings from now on. And my immediate thought was “who died?“"

80,"Everyone’s so angry these days, that they actually don’t even know who to take their anger out on. So they misplace it to the person nearest to them or to whoever will entertain it or listen to them."
