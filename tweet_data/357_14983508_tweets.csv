1,@howardlindzon @obermattj @SocialLeverage You looks to be building out the dream team
2,It’s a trend and company I have never discussed. This one is obscure
3,@RONALDRIBBONS It’s not CROX but no more hints
4,Came across a super odd and unusually ugly fashion trend last night on TikTok. It’s investable. Take a guess at it.  I’ll disclose the trade and reward the first to get it right on tomorrow’s https://t.co/MH708IgsRQ
5,@realMeetKevin In all seriousness I 100% see this happening
6,"Lots of conversations with young founders contemplating the NFT path for their ventures. That’s how it should be, as opposed to seeking out a business plan for your NFT project."

8,So far this one aging well https://t.co/8oQOjSwgT2
9,@goldilock1969 I’ll take a look
10,"My Super Bowl bet is not a wager or stock/crypto/NFT trade. Picked up this PSA 10 GEM MINT autographed rookie for $3,500. Rams victory (50/50 probability) likely returns 4X+ on this card.

11,@Helloimmorgan Creative destuctionism works best when there are many more losers than winners
12,@jwhoffmann10 @Meta @davehanson That’s probably the worst option for Peloton. Nike and their Metaverse would be the best culture fit.
13,This is 2022. Woke up to Nike airdropping me $48k (USD value) of mystery digital merch for my @RTFKTstudios CloneX avatars. Flip the boxes and take the cash or hold out to see what’s inside? https://t.co/ZPCy6HdlKX
14,@_thirdFriday @GutterCatGang Thank you
15,@DanBullzerian Been hedged since Summer and recently fully exited but picked up a few shares Friday on the acquisition speculation
16,I applaud female artist @VarvaraAlay for making a meaningful time and financial commitment to support children causes with proceeds from her amazing project @FlowerGirlsNFT. I’ll pay it forward by committing to donate 100% of my future FlowerGirlsNFT profits to those causes. https://t.co/xsyEK2aFlJ

19,@iamTeddyKGB Probably Thursday
20,@8Qs12 I sold off a sizable part of my Lit position as I needed liquidity for another project but still have double my original position and am collecting their Airdrops which have been amazing. It’s one of my favorite culture oriented projects but has always been nominal % of portfolio
21,@pkyle25 @catalinawhales @ZillazNFT I’m indirectly invested in them through a small DAO I’m in with some like minded friends
22,@FunnyMoney79 Been watching it a while
23,"So, NFTs. 75% chance I’ve lost my mind (likely) and these “blue chip” projects I’m in go to $0. 25% this is the messy start of the democratization of capital markets leading to 10X+ return from here? Decent risk adjusted ROI but either way we are learning, building, &amp; having fun"

25,@tmyrbrgh @jordan_mclain @Alex__Pitti I’ve watched it. It’s a well informed and craft-fully articulated take on the recent history and current state of NFTs but lacks the foresight of the where the sector is headed.
26,@renegademasterr @pixelvault_ @MetaHero_ @coolcatsnft @worldofwomennft @AdamBombSquad @larvalabs @RTFKTstudios @wolfdotgame @BoredApeYC @DumbMoneyTV We both see it

38,@Wild_Bill32 Everything you are going through right now with $PTON I have experienced through the yrs x10. It sucks hard but you will slowly rebuild and be better for it. Your have the investor chops to be one of the best.
39,This would never happen in the metaverse https://t.co/IlhqG9xs7N
40,@howardlindzon Let me know when your ready for a deep dive discussion on NFTs and p2e gaming
41,@RealCryptoCoach @wolfdotgame I thought about making that exact trade. You did it
42,@SqueezyMcSqueez @therealYuriM I’ve been hedging and exiting through a combination of put options and sales over the past 9 months.  Agree this bike will ride again and look forward to the next $pton journey even if I re-join it late
43,@MCM0NEY @coolcatsnft One would expect a price drop after the airdrop snapshot for CoolPets but the imminent release of $MILK token and their 1.0 p2e game could counterbalance that move. There is no historic NFT precedent I’m aware of for this specific series of events.

56,@bielliard @Crocs @HeyDudeShoesUSA Yes
57,@MrCryptoDaddy @coolcatsnft @alienfrens They are super cool but trying to stay focused on cats for now
58,@realjustmaiko @coolcatsnft My strategy was to focus on mid tier (wild 1 - exotic 1) floor cats for maximum $milk production per dollar spent on cats. A few others picked up on this strategy and gave since moved those mid-tier floor prices up.
59,"@ilipaskalev @coolcatsnft Been researching coolcats,the community culture, team, and roadmap for months. The differentiation, positivity, and focus on metaverse scalable gaming for the masses won me over. Plus, I really like the cats!"

75,@bbqsoap Yes but much smaller position now and been hedging nearly every quarter. I’ll go long bigger once the customer data improves
76,@Punk7572 Sad to give her up. Treat her right.
