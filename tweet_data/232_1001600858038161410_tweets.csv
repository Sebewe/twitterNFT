86,@kerryflips @Slickyeth Insane how irrational this market is at price discovery. That level of dev incompetency is a big 🚩. I don’t use Solidity or write smart contracts but I’ve seen enough of them to understand how simple it was to avoid.
87,Participation is key in this space. Hit as many WL as you can and maybe you’ll get a project with a contract loop and load up on their failures @fishyfamNFT kek
88,"@kerryflips @thewildshot44 You just had to transfer out, having 0 FishyFam in ur wallet means you can re-mint. Textbook failure on the devs part.

Could keep going but I gotta get to work, cya."
95,"@T__NFT @AzukiZen 5) Most importantly, floor is *not trash*. This is extremely crucial here. Most PFP-based NFTs fail the first step to seeing their project come to fruition for this very reason. They have went above and beyond when it came to trait diversity, their fitment, and consistent style."
96,"@T__NFT @AzukiZen 4) They've demonstrated they can animate, and they haven't made any pie in the sky roadmap they can't deliver on. They clearly have content, their marketing is quality and effective. Efficient moves and not setting expectations are a massive key to victory in this space."
97,@T__NFT @AzukiZen 3) They've carved out a massive moat. Anime-style art is something that has not been properly executed in a way that captures the wide market as Azuki has yet. This is the first proper execution where people are identifying with and wanting to own the art.
98,"@T__NFT @AzukiZen 1) This is Eastern art, and if you haven't been exposed to it's culture and aren't a fan, you won't really be into it.
2) The team is stacked. DYOR. They optimized the minting contract in a way that has never been done before. Their mantra is ""dope sh*t only"" and they stuck to it"
