42,"There’s also so much mystery left behind this project and I want to be involved in it. 
And for a project to be out for 3 months+ and to only just have undergone its first correction, makes me extremely bullish for the future. 
Thanks for taking the time 🤝"
43,"Invisible friends art looks very cool,l but that’s all they’re offering atm.. 
I’m betting the ‘very high’ S2 will regain its 25eth status soon and Vault Boxes and Land will also increase in value by a good amount. My guess is that 10eth I’ve dropped will be worth 30 in 2months."
44,"Stay alive long enough and you’re guaranteed at least 2eth, get to the final and it’s 3-4eth. 
-Ellio dropped a question in Angies Bar yesterday asking if S2s ‘are ready’? 
- Becker and Ellio have always brought a huge amount of value to the holders and this is only the beginning"
45,"Some great networking going on and S1 Citizens have been very welcoming.
-@SeedifyFund announced earlier this year, S2s will also be allocated in the airdrop for $SNFTs. 
- the final PubG tournament is taking place this weekend for Land. (This is huge imo)."
46,"- NEO Tokyo has just gone through pretty much it’s first ever correction
