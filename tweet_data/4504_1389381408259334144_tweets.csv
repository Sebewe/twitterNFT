I think the space needs to stop looking at every lazy derivative as ""similar"" to projects that are actually amazingly artistic."
1,@GratefulApe_eth @BYOPills Depends on the goal. I'd go either a full set (pill/vape/apostle) or abundant land if you can swing it. Thing is though...vape is critical with the pill
2,@YatMaxi Yup
3,@flipdrago Getting ready eh 👀
4,@flipdrago Play &amp; Earn needs to be the standard vernacular
5,@imgomgom 😂
6,@Ape7068 @yugalabs @BoredApeYC Agreed
7,"@TaxmanNFT @jmt_nft Oh gotcha. Yeah, I'm not taking that route either. Was just wondering if there was some other method people were looking to claim. More out of interest then anything else."
8,@TaxmanNFT @jmt_nft Just out of curiosity what would be the less conservative approach here?
9,"@zscuffed @ThePixlverse @Pixelmon Ha, yeah. I don't even know anymore. Too much projects popping out of nowhere"
10,"@zscuffed Jesus, imagine all those who bought @ThePixlverse could've spent their 3 ETH on a NFT that would allow for the right to live here and the team would've still been able to pocket another 1.5 ish million."
11,@friesframe @BoredApeYC All those years of school for a PhD and they still missed the yacht 😐
12,@bejado @BoredApeYC The skull is sick
13,@CapetainTrippy @BoredApeYC 😂
14,"@XaosBear With the way things are going, I wouldn't take anyone's advice. DYOR is super critical right now"
15,@dutchtide @BoredApe1000 ☝️☝️☝️
16,"@0x_fxnction Pfff, depends on the level of Idiocracy the NFT market has reached 😂"
17,@DavidIainBrown @BYOPills @WonderPals @coolcatsnft Anything BYO has far greater upside IMO
18,"@DiscoverXnft Based on the competence I've seen from about 90% of these projects, we might have to extend Q1 by 3 years instead 😐"
19,@cryptojefejuan @boredgentleman Kevin
20,@TommyAvalanche @PuffyPawsPack @TheShamdoo How do people still not know that shamdoo is a 💩
21,@rgr_park @nftworldsNFT Rather then fluid and adapt maybe just stop trading and just invest instead 🤷🏽‍♂️
22,"@nft_metaman @nftworldsNFT When it pulled back hard 3 days ago, I know people are gonna regret it. No way is gonna pull back after the drop. Holders are way too bullish now"
23,@GregJrNorman And people don't think the price is being suppressed 😐
24,"@sickpencil Totally, I hear ya"
25,"@boredapex @BYOPills Yeah, I had no idea. I just thought the trip effect from the pill was unique so I picked one up. If I HAD known though...😅"
26,@DiscoverXnft Y'all deserve the deepest of bear markets 🤣
27,"@sickpencil Investing markets of any sort are rough. Took me the market crash in 2008 then the start of the crypto bear in 2018 to really build up a thicker skin. ""What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger"" is more real in this space then most."
28,"@CHISKYLINEai @B_rightBrooks @ToolsOfRockNFT Nothing against tools of rock but I'll never understand the aesthetic choices for some of these pieces. Like, why are the eyes all messed up 😂"
29,"@ShrewdCharlie Even a token won't be enough. Most ""games"" will die out quickly. I expect only 2-3 will survive. We're still way too deep in the mindless, mania portion of the market. Rose tinted glasses all over"
30,@iamDCinvestor And that's what they want you to think 😏
31,@violeta_eth @iamDCinvestor 😂 no one has a clue. This is pure speculation. Take it all with a grain of salt
32,@PeterSchiff You're such a 💩 lol
33,@Khalissman 😂🤦🏾
34,@NateAlexNFT Well they really let the cat outta the bag here didn't they 😐
35,@GraffirapNFT @BYOPills @kkop Just wait till they realize how important vapes are 👀
36,@NudeYogaGirl @sibeleth ☝️😐
37,"@ape7458 I had to double check before doing this but yes, I agree"
38,"@richerd When exactly did you get into NFTs because I'd argue that even starting back in 2017, the ""art"" behind NFTs was and still is highly objective."
39,@ImGlassCrown @Nftbagger Only because you'll never hear from those who don't make it 😂
40,@NFTJaonk Mint price 😂
41,@sartoshi_nft 😂
42,@madsincognito Apparently no one knows but people like it 😂
43,@minibossgrl Yup
44,This is how you ride out the dip https://t.co/KGpGonl0A6
45,@BarterBlex 😎 https://t.co/fCObJPJO8D
46,@minibossgrl Double dip
47,@SHAQ Interesting choice
48,RT @Florian54: $DERO Stargate mainnet is live. Homomorphic Encryption Blockchain. You could ask : why? Simply because $PrivacyMatters . If…
49,@Grape_Apiator @TheSnoopAvatars Your pirate king is pretty sweet though
50,@Grape_Apiator @TheSnoopAvatars They're all kings sir 👑
51,@Elimy_GM Far better odds with NFTs though 😂
52,"@YatMaxi I'll bet you $60M this is a AI generated face 😂
You'd have to be dumb as rocks at this point to doxx as a Pixelmon founder"
53,@pranksy @BrettRichey @xBenJamminx @WAWHumanRights ☝️👍
54,"@Mir_cleM_n @TommyAvalanche @DiscoverXnft @InvsbleFriends Prove it's all organic, I'll wait"
55,"@TommyAvalanche @DiscoverXnft @InvsbleFriends Being this early into NFTs and saying ""I don't gamble"" is an oxymoron 😐"
56,"@TommyAvalanche @DiscoverXnft @InvsbleFriends ""mind your own business"" 😂
Dude chill. This is a public forum and everyone with a drop of intelligence knows that regardless of anyone's opinion, everything here is still subject to DYOR."
57,@x_wx_x Yup
58,@nikolai_sosa @CloutedMind @BoredApeYC @doodles @squiggles @hypebearsclub @GooniezNFT @DentedFeelsNFT @weatherreport @Pixelmon hope to god there is no next @Pixelmon
59,@CloutedMind @BoredApeYC @doodles Are you ever coming back to defend your statement about why doodles are so innovative?
60,@MrMiyagi011 I was gonna offer 300 ETH but ok...if you say so 🤷
61,"@rgr_park @nftworldsNFT This dip caused by those trying to front run the air drop off not gonna age well. As a recipient of said air drop, I'm telling you I'm not selling and I have a feeling a lot of others won't either"
62,@KOBESYSTEM143 @HarvestNFTs for a tax loss 😏
63,"@EB7 Only one I accept is NFT world's with a 10%. 
They minted that for free and had to prove themselves before sales flew. It's like the exact opposite of @Pixelmon"
64,@EB7 Yup
65,"@JohnKnopfPhotos @NudeYogaGirl I get what you're saying but money does matter. It broke up my family, we lost our house, filed bankruptcy, and my mom retired as a teacher and can't afford to continue to live in the US with us and had to move back to Brazil."
66,@BitbonesNFT Looks too good. Maybe screw up the face a little bit and put it on its side if you want to make $70M 😐
67,"@DiscoverXnft No idea what ""tenebra"" means 😂"
68,@KattyBoopNFT Get em
69,@economist I do agree to some degree otherwise though
70,@economist It's hard to say. Complete radio silence and that smirk in the interview is pretty bullish
71,@NathanHeadPhoto Why don't these relative tech savvy people just buy one on secondary 😐
72,@NateAlexNFT 😂 I didn't think things could get much worse then mekas but here we are
73,@0xchima A lot of those comparisons are totally off 😂
74,@DiscoverXnft When a tenebra team member makes a statement like this it's time to walk away
75,@voytexkoz @strangechances So do a lot of other chains without the downsides of sol
76,@Cryptotsu If sent to an exchange will the swap process be taken care of by them?
77,@coffeebreak_YT This dude is known for taking the controversial stance. He's doing it for views. I'd say ignore this asshole
78,@SmokezXBT @BYOPills @nftworldsNFT I have both. Nft worlds has every Minecraft player in the world ready to onboard. This is not something to disregard. BYO still has to prove it's functional game mechanics.
79,@GIBBSGRANT @Pixelmon @TheSnoopAvatars I love how the dev made the excuse that opensea can't render 3D assets properly
80,@GIBBSGRANT @Pixelmon @TheSnoopAvatars It's not 3 ETH anymore 😂
81,@jason690256 @0xfoobar I have a lot of em 😅
82,@jason690256 I'll send him a HDPunks if he wants one. Tell him to check out the project and if he likes it let me know. It's a @0xfoobar project from back in June of 2021
83,"Hey @Pixelmon wanna know a way that MAYBE you might be able to redeem yourselves?

If you're not gonna refund the people who unfortunately minted your project then donate 75% of the $70M you raised to help support those suffering in Ukraine.

Then build with the leftovers"
84,@bkdurant @digitalartchick Trying to sleep at night knowing you pumped and dumped on so many people ... but look at all the ETH she's collected 🤷
85,@OGDfarmer The mint price alone was a clear sign to stay the fuck away
86,@0xfoobar 😂
87,"@Syberer Look dude, you scammed the space. Simple as that. You came in here unprepared requesting an insane mint price that only an asshole would ask for. GIVE THE MONEY BACK!

https://t.co/N6VrVPskeQ
Also...my little 3D Doggie looks perfectly fine on OS. The damn thing is even dancing 😂"
88,Wtf @Applebees 🤦🏾 https://t.co/PXae3I7A00
89,@kslay456 @BYOPills Delisted my only one out of 5 I had listed at 2.45. getting way too close to fast 😂
90,@RiddlerNFT @doodles @BYOPills Yup
91,"@nftcryptomaster If you ever get that thought again, just run some numbers of the potential monthly income just from staking. If/when $WRLD hits $1+ which is highly likely. 
Of course, nothing wrong w/ taking profits within your comfort zone but good advice is never FOMO in or dump out of fear 🍻"
92,"@Fuyu_eth @nftworldsNFT jesus, it got down to 10 😂"
93,"@CapetainTrippy Ser that's trading, not investing 😏"
94,@IAmCryptoPapi @dutchtide @RTFKTstudios Been enjoying em since 0.03 😎
95,"@CryptoGenghisK @Muadxib Yeah, that could be lol"
96,@x_wx_x Buckets till infinity then 😂
97,@x_wx_x 🤔
98,"@voxviking @tmagled @AstonDreamz @MotionMarkus Awesome. Thanks for getting back with me. Wasn't trying to FUD, was genuinely curious 😅"
99,@NftFat @opensea @coolcatsnft I'm sorry. Opensea can't do anything unfortunately to get it back to you. All they can do is flag the thief's wallet but they can still sell/trade in other ways 😕
