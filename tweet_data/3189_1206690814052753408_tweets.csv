46,@Brooksgallery1 You should just partner the NFT with the painting and airdrop it on mainnet to purchaser. Not very NFT spirit to have a physical and also sell it as a digital. Just sharing my piece https://t.co/OFK0rjcJTy

80,@LooksRareNFT a message system on the platform would be elite - even if its something someone would need to opt into to prevent unwanted spam. Be it onchain or not a way to message sellers directly through a platform would be powerful - ideally make it opt in to help stop scams.
81,@HeichanART I could remember what this was didnt bookmark it and had an alarm set and missed it OOD
82,"Good read, essentially thought disconnecting your wallet in almost every instance does nothing. There has been nothing so far that has come from just connecting- NOT SIGNING - JUST CONNECTING to a site that asks typical wallet permissions like seeing your address https://t.co/rvWiIBNOYJ"
