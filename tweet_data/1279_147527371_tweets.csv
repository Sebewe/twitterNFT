29,"@RealMahaloMike This is centred more around buyer behaviour and general trends and less about on-chain data. Data will change as tokens change hands, consumer behaviour rarely does and is steered by fear, hope, excitement, greed and a range of emotions."
30,@wabdoteth 😆
31,I’ve seen this play over time and time again. Nothing new.
32,"At sub 3eth, Hape has more potential upside than downsides, same as Karafuru. Invisible Friends (not fudding) will still drop sub 6eth down the line and ride back up. It’s a game of volume and interests and there’ll always be a new shiny NFT per time."
33,"Hence they’ll watch it hit 10eth and expect it’ll hit 20eth. They forget that the more expensive an NFT is, the less affordable it is to a wider market. So the flippers will get impatient and drop the price to be able to exit, paving way for a new set of flippers and holders."
34,"People want their NFTs to hit 50Eth floor, but they also want to be able to easily sell it. How convenient?

The problems the Hapes and IFs of this world will have is that many of their buyers are holding their first/first expensive NFTs and they are not in it for the art."

56,"@feyi_x I agree. The proliferation of anything has its advantages and disadvantages. Similar to crypto, most projects will die off naturally from mint. In fact the highest ROI most NFTs will experience will be during/shortly after mint. People will begin to hold on to tested brands."
57,One project I’m waiting to mint is @AkuDreams. The other that I’m equally pumped about is @takashipom’s https://t.co/0ecn5RClLA. Many of the other projects are simply hyped. Nothing deep beyond good-looking graphics or 3d models. Utility is copy-paste from other projects.
