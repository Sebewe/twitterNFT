1,@MetaRaccoon You mean my pfp? This ape!
2,@MetaRaccoon So excited - I actually have a Ape and a Mutant - which one did you guys choose?
3,@avkastningsgud1 @GefflotKillian No brainer choice. Grab a beer also https://t.co/dcL9IX8JfR

19,@AlyssaMetaverse BAKC for sure. Nothing in BAYC universe should be under 10th

28,@dougboneparth This guy like OpenSea is clearly looking out for a Phishing attack. Too bad they told their staff to look out for a fishing attack
29,@hypnotizedApe Right on. I believe #BAKC will be the preeminent top of the Dog NFT universe like #BAYC current is for all NFTs and primate and profile pic projects
30,@tmagled @opensea OpenSea will be like the Yahoo on 2001
31,@hypnotizedApe I think you are right. Scarcity ultimately drives value. I’ve seen it in other multi family projects. Market still underestimates the value of Dogs in Roadmap 2.0
32,"@boredpharmacist @opensea @openseas They need more people - people who looks at security and customer support 24/7.  

Their Discord channel? I am actually 100% people get scammed on that channel or than they received help

People spent a lot of money revoking  - hope they do something to reimburse users"
33,@boredpharmacist @opensea Agree. I mean @openseas took over an hour to take down the hacker's account - allowing them to list and sell on the platform. It would have pretty obvious in 1 minute
34,@hypnotizedApe @AlexMetaverse @boredapebot Thanks - the shrunken head is just a great combo
35,@hypnotizedApe @AlexMetaverse @boredapebot Yeah - he needs to hang out with the crazies to get acclimatized ahead of battle https://t.co/mgCX9AknuP
36,@hypnotizedApe @AlexMetaverse @boredapebot I have several dogs - but for some reason I like this one. It just speaks to me. This one NGMI in a mutant battle I think https://t.co/npqemWFJz2

49,@RaeesTahir @BT Cash grab at its finest
50,"@Gee__Gazza @BT @crypto888crypto It says - I am now not getting the risk free cash bag upfront I expected so I am rugging the mint. Disgraceful

A lot of people were watching the mint waiting the BUY before the rug pull"
51,"@BT Seriously - you say that you don't care about the price on Spaces and then now you obviously do? 

How do you now say that this is not a total CASH GRAB?"
52,"@BT I don't think it makes sense to change the rules again for the second time as a knee jerk reaction...

Focus long term and not short term per the advice of the market from days ago"

54,@piovincenzo_ Market rate is $10k per inch fyi
55,@hypnotizedApe Sure. But if that’s the floor then Trippy under your formula would be $10 million +
56,@hypnotizedApe Yeah ok - I am not so convinced yet. Especially if Ape floor goes to 200eth+ and Eth is over $5k
57,@hypnotizedApe Sure - But why cant you get it tomorrow?
