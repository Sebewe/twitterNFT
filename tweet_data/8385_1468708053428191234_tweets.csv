18,"This thread represents a progression in our work. We are working very hard to add more biological significance to our pieces every day! We love sharing our updates with our friends and supporters. 

If any of this interests you, feel free to join us: https://t.co/GdjZ0zyM5x"
19,In putting this all together we end up with a collection of highly varied pieces that are greatly informed by their respective proteins!! Here are some (very early) examples! 🧵 https://t.co/Fbqo1Rc2M7
20,"Following this, we then use the amino acid (AA) sequence of the protein of interest to inform the spatial location of bars within the piece, as well as utilize information about the AA's molecular composition to color each segment. 🧵 https://t.co/UlC2HhqtOE"
21,"The next step involves matching the stylistic appearance of the bars to the region that the protein exists within the cell. Here, we were inspired by unique elements from a number of subcellular compartments/structures. 🧵 https://t.co/U6VdQbt00H"
22,To break it down -- our first step involves constructing velocity fields based off of bioinformatic data (gene ontology) for the given protein of interest. These velocity fields aim to structurally represent a relevant biological process that the protein is involved in. 🧵 https://t.co/joYbNJCuaE
23,"Some exciting updates! 

Over the last few days, we've reworked our method for utilizing both micro- and macro-scale features of protein data to inform our pieces of generative art. The process is described below: 🧵 https://t.co/Ta1agoeqsH"
