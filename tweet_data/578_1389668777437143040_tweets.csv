5,"@metaMori_eth Nah I like it, it's a good take, it's just that my brain has a hard time computing the normal world after almost a year. What a sweet escape."
6,@metaMori_eth I thought this was about whitelists tbh.
7,@AngelClarkSays @ICanSwimInLand And then those 2 too lol: https://t.co/Y1W9HODew9
8,"@AngelClarkSays @ICanSwimInLand Yeah that seems to be the safest way. But the NFT I choose at random (punks comics origin stories) has 2 safe transfer forms, which is confusing: https://t.co/aSEEay9cZx"
9,"@AngelClarkSays @ICanSwimInLand Yeah etherscan lets you see your tranactions ofc, but you would have to interact with the contract to send it, no? Like this: https://t.co/at8WlZAWDN"
10,"@ICanSwimInLand @AngelClarkSays OS should be safe, last week's thing turned out to be a phising attack. But if you don't trust them you could use Looksrare, and I think you can even transfer NFT's directly with MM, I've never done that tho, so not sure how it works."

14,@tmagled Anybody in this space who claims to know anything instead of admitting that we're just lucky af because we were early is sus af.
15,"That moment when you add the lambchops, garlic and butter to the rosemary potatoes that have been sizzling in olive oil for 15 minutes is something special."
16,"@JetSetTogether Hell yeah. A lot of fake shit happening in this space on a daily basis but imo it's even worse when they're trying to push a fake narrative too. Just take the L and stfo, more opportunities coming, some of them might even be legit."
17,@_CAOS_BOY_ MFs been fading @TheAlienBoyNFT for 6 months straight. Idk when and idgaf but it will be a rude awakening. Apes were a conviction play and it payed out early. Alien boys are a conviction play too and I'm a patient mothafucka.
18,"@dagg3rhigh Aight, I like that... Don't have the time to actually do it but this is the way."
19,"@dagg3rhigh People having no stake whatsoever in the ecosystem getting wl too? Genuine question... I missed out on getting in early but bought some $magic mid Jan, because I don't have the time for a deep dive."
20,@gastronemoose Those pants deserve a pump.
21,@dagg3rhigh *no difference to apes
22,"@dagg3rhigh Will any of them be free mint for everyone tho? Not trying to stir shit up, I'm just trying to say that OG ecosytem participants will have outsized benefits, so no difference to except a few months difference..."
23,@dagg3rhigh It may be free for ppl holding a smol brain but there's no free entry anymore. OG's will get free mints but a $12k entry price is not as egalitarian as you make it sound imo. I have $magic bags but plz don't make it sound like this is the working people's ape.
24,"@tmagled @Gee__Gazza Bought a small amount at $200ish because how much more can it drop, right? Right? (pain,pain)"
25,@NFTethics https://t.co/tcTlAkO39Z
26,@bndaughety @BoredApeYC Yeah and as a certified dumbass dropping questionable jokes on the regular I better stfu lol. I'm not one of those influencers scamming people for 1k ETH a pop but maybe I should take a mental health break anyways haha...
27,"@bndaughety @BoredApeYC Yeah ok maybe I'm just traumatized by all the fake shit, to the point that I even can't appreciate a dumb joke anymore. WTF has become of me hahaha..."

31,"@bndaughety @BoredApeYC Dumbass joke if you ask me with 2k+ followers and a lot of them probably apes, but maybe that's just me."
32,@bndaughety @BoredApeYC https://t.co/IdXj8yuBMb
33,@bndaughety @BoredApeYC Anybody can post random shit for fake hype and engagement and another 1k followers.
34,"@bndaughety @BoredApeYC Yeah, I suppose you got the secret sauce, just like the ppl telling us about their animator frens working hard on those superbowl commercials. Put up or shut up, you're doing more harm than well."
35,"@LoganJames @cr0ssETH OMG what a dunk, you're so smart, first person to figure this out. BTW I'm a german leftist having scars on my skull from getting my head smashed in by Neonazis. The thing you don't understand is that we're fighting against the banks and fucking facebook and such."
36,"@WaitWhut4 @SlimGrim5 @justinavery @the_x2y2 @LooksRareNFT Thank you, I enjoyed your point of view too. We're all coming from different places but as long as we can talk freely and have respect for each other, no matter how much we may disagree, we'll be better off and win one way or the other."
37,@neurod3g3n @SlimGrim5 @justinavery @the_x2y2 @looksrare Yeah valid point. It's just not worth the risk for me and if they're true to their word I can just wait and watch and claim in a year if I should be wrong and they turn out to be the true decentralized for the people NFT marketplace.
38,"@WaitWhut4 @SlimGrim5 @justinavery @the_x2y2 @LooksRareNFT Yeah ofc, no hate, if you want to take the gamble for an ETH or two, go for it. Maybe I'm the idiot and I'll regret it in a few months, wouldn't be the first time. But as it stands right now, I don't trust my ability to https://t.co/DxBGiv2hSu fast enough to make it worth it."
39,"@WaitWhut4 @SlimGrim5 @justinavery @the_x2y2 @LooksRareNFT Yeh you could claim listing trash for like 5 minutes, then that got paused to pump the price, uhhm, no, uh, improve user experience, yeah, that. Now I have to give give blind access to valuable collections to a contract that might or might not be secured by a multisign. GTFO."
40,"@WaitWhut4 @SlimGrim5 @justinavery @the_x2y2 The difference is that @LooksRareNFT was open about this stuff and had OGs I trust (that have been compensated nicely but yeah, that's just how it works) behind them. This project has given me sus vibes from the start and it's only getting worse."
41,"@neurod3g3n @SlimGrim5 @justinavery @the_x2y2 @looksrare People are always gonna try to game the system. Their whole argument was to shit on @looksrare for gaming the system with the washtrades. Can't have it both ways, either you give the same opportunities to the small fish or you're just in it for the whale money."
42,"@SlimGrim5 @justinavery @the_x2y2 Yeah if your narrative is that @looksrare was not perfect enough because fuck the whales, changing the rules mid way to only let privileged people claim makes it look like another opportunistic cashgrab. Pausing the claim was sus already, as it conveniently pumped the price. Idk."

62,"@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Absolutely, nuance is important, I've seen a lot of ridiculous shit. But the solution can't be to say ""this is web3, everything is allowed here""."
63,@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Didn't see that I just saw the thing with the drake lyrics
64,@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains NOBODY says he doesn't have a right to have an opinion. But certain opinions have the consequence that people think you should not have certain positions.
65,@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains This for example is total bullshit imo. THAT'S what fakeass woke virtue signaling looks like. https://t.co/rCx8XdI818
66,"@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Ironically the catholic church seems to be good at both, but you're completely missing (or evading) my point again . You said we should be accepting to EVERYONE.  Bigotry, racism, everything goes in Web 3, no? Because if not we're just arguing about what is acceptable."
67,"@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains If you follow that logic to the end, it would be OK if we had a white supremacist running Uniswap, as long as he only posts racist shit once a year or so. Maybe a pedo at the head of the Ethereum foundation? How could we call ourselves progressive otherwise?"
68,"RT @CryptoCronkite: firing for rap lyrics tweeted 10 years ago is fucking stupid

69,@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Nobody wants to confiscate his private keys. What we're talking about is if he should be the public face and official spokesperson of one of the core infrastructure protocols of the Ethereum network.
70,"@ethereansinfo @0xHelix @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains TNL terminated his contract after the vote of the community stewards, while the proposal for the DAO-wide vote already had a large majority."
71,"@ethereansinfo @0xHelix @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains As for TNL terminating his contract, that's a private company trying to limit the damage he's already done to ENS."
72,"@ethereansinfo @0xHelix @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains He has been removed as a community steward through a majority vote by the other stewards (which have been chosen by the DAO): https://t.co/cfipMogr7Q
The proposal for a DAO-wide vote to remove him as director is at 101 vs 8:  https://t.co/dgkFPX6n83"
73,"@ethereansinfo @0xHelix @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Twitter suspending his account is censorship, and as I said before, I'm against that.

The ENS community taking a vote and deciding that they don't want a bigot as their public face is not. That's called democracy."
74,"@ethereansinfo @0xHelix @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains I read the tweet, maybe you didn't read my first reply to you. Your sexuality is not a choice, just like your skin color. https://t.co/MSCYhL7OOr"
75,"@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains I never campaigned for anything, this is the first thing I said about this. But if you say hateful shit, it can have consequences..."
76,"@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains I would absolutely criticize that too. 

I'm more afraid of where we'll end up if we don't speak up against hate. I'm not going to sing kumbayah with bigots and racists because some people think that's what web3 and decentralization mean."
77,"@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Yeah but he doubled down hard. And again, replace ""gay"" with ""black"" and ask yourself if you would keep that person as your communications person if it was your company."
78,@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Ok maybe I misunderstood when you said I should just block/unfollow. I guess we just disagree on him getting fired being justified or not.
79,"@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Never said he doesn't. And for the record, I don't think he should be suspended from Twitter. But he should not be protected from criticism either."
80,"@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Yeah and they'll have to accept that I'm going to give them shit if they spread hatred, bigotry, racism, etc."
81,"@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains So what you're saying is we're not allowed to criticize anyone, ever?"
82,@0xHelix @ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Being tolerant with intolerant people is a fallacy. What if someone says that black people are evil? Should we be nice and inclusive towards them? Would you criticize their employer for not wanting them as their communications person anymore?
83,"@ethereansinfo @_bassen_ @tambayNFT @nicksdjohnson @ensdomains Being gay or trans is who they are, not what they're doing. It's not a choice. This is what you are missing."
84,@Versuhtyle Yeah that's fair. I'm a nobody and my inbox and notifications are kinda stupid already. Can't imagine what life at 20k+ would be like.

89,"@DheerajShah_ @squiggles Again, I won't go into too much detail as it's disgusting af and could get ppl banned from web2 platforms, but if you search for the jungle freaks artist and his past work, you'll know why I have a fucking problem with ""cute"" projects whitelisting anyone who's still holding this."
90,"@DheerajShah_ @squiggles I'm not going to post the images here but if you go down the rabbit hole (google ""jungle freaks racist""), there's comics of a 60s convertible, drawing dead black people on a rope, being cheered on by the kkk, with some kind of stupid joke. And much more."

93,"Hey @squiggles, care to explain why you're giving WL spots (including a special discord role) to fucking jungle freaks? Are any of your team members still involved with a project that thought having a scumbag racist as their artist is no biggie? https://t.co/hZrN8LbCtd"
