15,@davpleb @JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon Damn craw. Aggressive
16,"@dadjudicator @CRYPTOALBATROSS @JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon And that’s cool and commendable, I’m more into fostering the current community who I have relationships with and giving them a fighting chance against people without voxos taking 250 eth from our community."
17,@dadjudicator @CRYPTOALBATROSS @JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon Read: working against hundreds of active community members out of eth they are trying to win?
18,"@dadjudicator @CRYPTOALBATROSS @JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon Also, your weird power squabbles with craw really don’t have anything to do with me, and I’d appreciate it if you left me out of it dude."
19,"@dadjudicator @CRYPTOALBATROSS @JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon I’m really sorry you wanted to try to form your own team and didn’t want to join the club team until the sign up period was closed. 

Clearly the community team that was formed doesn’t have that much of a monopoly on the game considering they’re literally tied with a group of 3🤷"
20,"@dadjudicator @voxodeus @Pixelmon Here. Fixed it. 

Good vs Trash https://t.co/0CNAjuSIAb"
21,@dadjudicator @voxodeus @Pixelmon Thought that’s what I did but okay.
22,"@dadjudicator @CRYPTOALBATROSS @JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon I mean… a team formed of wallets that hold no voxos is currently tied with the community team so seems to me like they’d have just won without the community forming a team 🤷

They’re on track to spend about 30 eth on keys for the top prize alone. How would we have competed?"
23,"At least the Pixelmon team still don’t have enough money to successfully run for the senate. 

Just thought this was funny today… and by funny I mean depressing. https://t.co/vzEhQ4xMpq"
24,"@jdkahler @madlaine63 @samthielman I mean. At minimum you have to at least have $5,000 according to the FEC (which for many is an insurmountable amount to risk). 

But to win you need close to 100 million apparently. If I could get people to give me 100 million dollars I’d do a lot more with it than be a senator. https://t.co/AqnkRkNF53"

30,This was the first mint of Voxodeus. Eth just over 2100 for context. https://t.co/fw7IdND7Wh
31,@CRYPTOALBATROSS @JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon https://t.co/sq6wENpg55
32,@CRYPTOALBATROSS @JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon PS if you missed your second free mint you’re getting an heirloom artifact airdropped instead. They know people missed the windows. Probably after the minter rewards implementation.
33,"@CRYPTOALBATROSS @JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon Not when the mint started it wasn’t. I agree the bonding curve sucked, but it was standard at the time. Apes redefined what was normal a couple weeks into the mint. But they changed it 🤷

You SHOULD come check out the game though. The community formed a team to compete w/ 🐋s https://t.co/tBE5itY6bf"
34,@JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon I was comparing a project that raised a shit ton of eth with unrevealed art that turned out to be bad with a project that raised less than that with revealed art that was good.

37,"@JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon You should probably talk to your podcast cohost 😅 royalties are a Nono to the sec (they asked a lot of lawyers) so they’ve designed a system of rewards (same funds, same wallet) that allow users to claim the reward instead of being given it for nothing. Next after the game…"
38,@JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon Also pretty sure eth was &lt; 2k at that time.
39,@JaimeMusings @voxodeus @Pixelmon Back when every nft project had bonding curves? That was flattened (with free mints given to users who minted at higher than .3) aaaaages ago. Big reason they had the curve was to fund a 500 eth contest (which had to be cut to 250 now and ongoing as we speak)
40,"Oh, and they didn’t need to spend an additional 2 million dollars to do it 😅 they were just… you know… talented."
41,"One of these is an established 3D project with custom music, toggle-able scenes, etc that minted (revealed daily) for 6 MONTHS @ .3. The other sold out immediately @ 3.

56,"@agmakosz @apelordeth @punk6529 I don't know about Canada, but in the US you have to gather evidence and provide reasonable suspicion before making an arrest. I.E. you need a warrant to get people's financial records from a bank. This isn't an individual, it's a broad action impacting (in theory) everyone in CA"

I haven’t seen hard details on what the DAO is going to have voting rights on. Will be interesting to see how it unfolds."
72,"@__nickalexander I think maybe a key decision that could be make (if this is a true DAO) would be to keep fund distribution for the organizations being set up on chain. 

Otherwise, if it is just fundraising, wouldn’t it be better to have someone who at least understands the space and it’s value?"
73,Cc @TrustlessState @punk6529 etc
74,What are thoughts on @AndrewYang starting a DAO for crypto advocacy? Has anyone even seen it or are you all too busy minting random trash still?
75,"@__nickalexander While I agree there’s a bit of a grift going on, we DO need to get more advocates in front of the media and congress. There’s so much misinformation flying around. This is a starshot investment in furthering education on the space."
76,"Andrew Yang is either going to burn in the anti-crypto fires or become one of the most important politicians of the last decade. If you are serious about the space, we do need to advocate for ourselves to the gov and start dispelling some of the misinformation. https://t.co/cg2j1ZLYkt"
77,"@online_nobody @AndrewYang That isn’t web3. NFTs are literally 1% of crypto. Look into DAOs, quadratic funding of public goods, and decentralized finance applications like @AaveAave. Those are web3."
78,@TheDaneMen @TheArtAppeal @AndrewYang That’s cool. I want those things too. How do we get them? Gov isn’t gonna give them to us clearly.
79,@PatResister @AndrewYang Best take of the responses so far. This alone doesn’t solve our problems. Education is sorely undervalued in the US.
80,"@parismarx @AndrewYang I think the point is that blockchain tech exposes tools which allow for easier redistribution of wealth. 

Look at @gitcoin for a good example of finding public goods through blockchain."

87,"@mosspuppet @Mihoda @Traci62268305 @AndrewYang Do you know what that means or what the company behind it is doing? It’s got very little to actually do with eth as a cryptocurrency😅

But we can resort to ad hominem arguments if you want to."
88,"@mosspuppet @Mihoda @Traci62268305 @AndrewYang It was in 2012. It is for things like dogecoin that mean literally nothing. It’s not for things like Eth. Buying eth buys you access to an economic network. It’s not just a number on a screen. It’s a ticket. 

Almost like crypto is a complex space with diverse value propositions."
89,"@mosspuppet @Mihoda @Traci62268305 @AndrewYang Some of them. I don’t personally think it’s a good way to go. A lot of cryptos treat the value of their token as a proxy for selling block space on the network. Since, you know, that’s what the tokens can actually be cashed in for. Blockspace is a valuable commodity."
90,"@Traci62268305 @Mihoda @mosspuppet @AndrewYang Asset price inflation is usually a precursor to CPI inflation. Especially if the gdp doesn’t grow in relation to it. The last 20 years contributes to the last 2 years. 

Plus the whole money printing thing. Plus the supply chain issues. Plus a whole host of other things."
91,"@Mihoda @mosspuppet @Traci62268305 @AndrewYang When I can put my money in a savings account and not actively loose money because of the decisions of my institutions, then I’ll consider not calling it failure."
92,@Mihoda @mosspuppet @Traci62268305 @AndrewYang The monetary policy of the last 50 years IS failing us. Asset price inflation has been outpacing GDP for the last 20 years at least and 40% of the current money supply was printed last year. There’s nothing backing the USD but the promises of the fed and debt. How is that success
93,"@Traci62268305 @Mihoda @mosspuppet @AndrewYang Suuure. The monetary policy of the last 50 years has nothing to do with the rampant asset price inflation outpacing the US GDP for the last two decades either.

Add to it 40% of the US dollars in existence were printed last year alone? Transitory? I don’t believe it."
94,"@Mihoda @mosspuppet @Traci62268305 @AndrewYang Right because the fed is doing a great job at controlling inflation (and unemployment?) right now. 

The monetary supply of most cryptocurrencies is either set or only changes at the consensus of the network. I’d rather have that than a dude who doesn’t need to think about money."
95,"@angrysunbird @Traci62268305 @AndrewYang The electricity use is literally the same amount as video games dude. And there are tons of efforts in place to reduce that energy use further and subsidize climate protection coming from blockchain. 

Almost every modern chain runs with 100x energy less than they used to."
96,@angrysunbird @Traci62268305 @AndrewYang No no. People definitely send death threats. I think you underestimate how much seething and irrational hatred there is for this tech.
97,@angrysunbird @Traci62268305 @AndrewYang Absolutely. A community bank with an open api. Great way to think about it. Putting money into the thing that is new in exchange for being part of the frontier of could be better is literally all we’re asking to do. Then people send death threats.
98,@angrysunbird @Traci62268305 @AndrewYang You know what else has lots of money? A collective decentralized lending pool that anyone can contribute any amount to. How do you think the banks GOT lots of money in the first place? They held onto it for people.
