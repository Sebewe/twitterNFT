6,Spaces in an hour?
7,@DatCryptoBoi yup
8,@ShitBidJos But at least we can point out the LARPs
9,"@ShitBidJos I'm gonna be honest, we are in an environment where making a lot of money without taking on a lot of risk is hard"
10,"Still shorting 

Probably goes broke right around the top, which I expect to be $55-60k https://t.co/WpXSb7pirA"
11,"@EmmaLladro I think we're going to see a choppy bear market with BTC.D and ETH.D pumping

Most alts have garbage tokenomics and people want the safety of BTC"
12,@BlurCrypto @anon75374998 but ser 😭
13,"@LarrywildmanG @TheMarc_1 @ThinkingBitmex Yes, probably, but not now. Weekly low is in."
14,@ShitBidJos @geraldine_oaks 🤣
15,@TheMarc_1 @ThinkingBitmex I think the bottom is in for crypto but we might just need a higher low
16,@duckbutt52 We might go down LTF but HTF I think the bottom is in
17,@enchiridion47 lol social distance
18,@ThinkingBitmex 🔥🔥🔥
19,"Shorts getting stopped out, Anon? 

Just add more margin. #Putin will bail you out by launching nuclear Armageddon. Great R/R to be shorting into a nuclear war 🙃 https://t.co/mQVvnmgZoY"
20,@stackxbt yeah worth considering
21,@eth35298683 lol
22,"@Carlini8N @sassal0x @DarrenLambTS Sell the launch, buy the mushroom cloud?"
23,@0xfbifemboy 🤫
24,@LadyofCrypto1 @MetisDAO @VitalikButerin @zksync same
25,"@LadyofCrypto1 @MetisDAO @VitalikButerin @zksync Yeah my only worry with $METIS is that if Bitcoin shits the bed it will go -99%

Look at what $GNO did in the 2018 bear market."
26,@crypto_fruit Maybe
27,"""Russia will start a nuclear war so I'm shorting""

Yeah, but you won't be alive to collect on it..."
28,@sonicthehedgor @toptickcrypto lol
29,@KGTachi You could take a scalp short targeting the red line
30,"Still in ""wait and see"" mode, bottom is probably in but we will have more clarity soon. 

$TOTAL https://t.co/VirpV0HPOj"
31,@_sethchong no I think the bottom is in
32,"@EricZ116 @VitalikButerin Don't trust, verify."
33,"Guys I am still #bullish. 

ETH &amp; BTC probably value levels here. 

Spot only, no leverage."
34,@insiliconot lol
35,"@heisenspergXBT really? 

Jesus Christ that sucks"
36,Jesus christ I'm in the wrong game lol https://t.co/Yn8Mugr0G1
37,@crypt0snorlax ok scalp short on Shitdano or something
38,@Michael29888253 @enchiridion47 devs are doing something to bears
39,"Don't short guys.

Long spot only."
40,"@enchiridion47 lol

I don't ever have to look at the chart"
41,"This guy is literally gonna give it all back now lol 

Bottom is in IMO https://t.co/uUS9GbJQOo"
42,@enchiridion47 But ser
43,Shorts are gonna get rekt https://t.co/if3cIxQiHJ
44,"@ethotaku yup, agreed."
45,"@DatCryptoBoi Bottom is probably in, trend following bots getting slaughtered

But trend followers make up for it when the market trends."
46,@Shermanisfm That would actually be bad because the the USA would try to ban it.
47,@samscrypto_ I think we go to 55k over 4-6 weeks
48,"@YapperYu If I'm right I'll still make money, I just left a lot on the table by capitulating at the bottom"
49,@YapperYu lol
50,"Markets-wise, the most bullish outcome is that Russia wins quickly in #Ukraine. 

It looks like that is about to happen, expect pumps. 

I didn't really trade this very well but I think overall the bullish thesis is correct, at least for the next few months."
51,@AINOOB4 You can look at prediction markets like Metaculus for the probabilities
52,"@dystopiabreaker Battery backup is feasible for hours, not weeks. 

Energy storage is a serious issue"
53,"@0xAlina Alina! Stop invading us! 🇷🇺

😜"
54,"@AINOOB4 Those things are ""maybe""'s"
55,yup https://t.co/pzuI1DZ4Sf
56,@enchiridion47 yup
57,@AINOOB4 I think I just over positioned. IMO we are probably bullish from here ...
58,@gametheorizing lol 🤡🤡🤡
59,"@CanteringClark Synthetic asset issuers (MIR, SNX)? 

Problem is the tokenomics sucks"
60,@LadyofCrypto1 @CanteringClark could be
61,"Shitcone longers get liquidated
JPEG enjoyooors get illiquidated https://t.co/rDmeiLdB7i"
62,@SoLuna_FTX Looks EXTREMELY rare.
63,"If you lost 5% on buying ETH/BTC at the wrong time, take a look at some of these altcoin charts 

💀💀💀 https://t.co/HbzRlcdSM3"
64,@ethotaku Nice I really should have had faith in hold
65,"@Nickyshatz IMO right now it's about having the right position given the information we have, controlling risks etc."
66,"@CryptoRat66 I didn't have any significant position at 44k, just a small ETH/BTC position (5% or something). Rejection from 45k meant no reason to be bullish. 

Here I think the right thing to do is to allocate a small portion to spot for long-term and wait to see."
67,@ShitBidJos @duckbutt52 Still using phantoms? Yikes.
68,"Bitcoin fail, gold win. https://t.co/0FkmoR4bPA"
69,@KGTachi Options are expensive right now
70,@Crypto_Educator It's not good if 30k breaks.
71,@0xRuler yup
72,"I disagree. 

I think if we are bullish, 30k will most likely not get tested. 

If it does get tested, I think we are in for a trip to the 20s. https://t.co/HQX63wZmso"
73,"In terms of fundamentals, I think if the Ukraine war is limited to a war in Ukraine, we have probably bottomed, but any escalation could send us down, and especially escalation in Asia (Taiwan)."
74,"I am happy with 33% ETH/BTC, 66% cash. Really that was the position to take yesterday.

The reason I don't want to take a more aggressive position is that having lost the 36k area, we are looking Bearish on the daily."
75,@deltaxbt_ Agreed.
76,"@tezzaboy98 Yeah, I suspect that might be the case."
77,@deltaxbt_ Agreed.
78,"@YapperYu IMO given what has happened be cautious.

I am 16% ETH, 16% BTC, 66% cash"
79,"@BitcoinEcon If you can take a loss of 6% when you are wrong, you can make up for it later. We should feel sorry for people who lost 90% though."
80,"@DatCryptoBoi yup, 💯"
81,"@DatCryptoBoi expecting a lot lower

😳 https://t.co/7BrAUYyF9g"
82,"@YapperYu I don't know, I think right now it depends on whether we can defend the $1.495 Tr low on TOTAL. We are kind of in no-man's land."
83,This chart is worth looking at to see how much you need to gain in order to recover from a given loss. https://t.co/OkU3F4Eu4X
84,"If you have 94% left, you can live to fight another day. 

There are people who lost 90% or even 100% of their portfolios in this downtrend by using leverage much higher up and hodling a leveraged position in a downtrend."
85,"Something to bear in mind when you enter a trade is how bad the outcome will be if you are wrong. 

If you enter a spot position in BTC or Ethereum you might lose 6% of the trade overnight like I just did. 

That's unfortunate, but you still have 94% left."
86,"@FailedTrader_ @SXJU_1M Gambling = no alpha. 

I think given that I held cash down from much higher, going from 100% cash to 66% cash is fine. It's just dumb to give up 4% of my portfolio by overallocating early"
87,"@SXJU_1M @FailedTrader_ I think the answer is simple: if you have information, go in in proportion to the amount of informational edge that you have. 

In this case it's not worth a full spot position given the amount of information I have."
88,"@FailedTrader_ I think the call is right, just the correct way to allocate was more cautious."
89,@KGTachi reclaim 36.5 = rebuy
90,@KGTachi I think it's fine to wait and see if a bottom forms now and then buy more.
91,@eth35298683 lol
92,"On the plus side, the advantage of spot positions in majors is that you will not take massive losses when things like this happen. 38k to 35.5k on #Bitcoin is 6% - not great, but also not a disaster."
93,"Lessons here: 

(1) even if it does seem like information is priced in, the market is less efficient than you think

(2) when you see conflicting information, don't go 100%. Go 33%, wait a bit, go another 33%, etc."
94,"OK, Putin/Russia worst case playing out. 

I think the bullish thesis long-term is fine, but I was careless to allocate 100% spot when technicals pointed one way and fundamentals pointed the other. 

I'll sell 66% of my position, if we bottomed I will trade the uptrend. https://t.co/p2T5qgkGCo"
95,"@DJ_DiamondHands Bottom was 33k, not 39."
96,"@MarathonCrypto_ Lol

Should have waited"
97,"Spot #Bitcoin and #Ethereum positions whilst people are jerking off over World war 3 

No leverage

GN"
98,"@bloodeezhell Perhaps 

It certainly looks low"
99,"@ethotaku The thing is, wars do not necessarily affect markets.

But, OTOH, it might"
