1,Anyone buying a Kevin at 8-9E doesn’t give a fuck about your normie opinions on NFTs. Fucking chads. https://t.co/Sf1YI05v7k
2,@NotJustCoins Still need? I can send i have a bit liquid atm
3,RT @NftSpoony: Getting better with the laser engraver by paying homage to some of my favourite upcoming projects. Are you Blessed or Posses…
4,Just cashed out for the 2nd time. This time it was 0.1 to buy lots of snacks.
5,Is there anything more underwhelming than an invisible friend used as a pfp?
6,@LadyRose_NFT Ahh I will find out soon. Having to switch banks soon
7,@LadyRose_NFT Have you withdrawn recently? I was only going on our conversation a few month ago! Is it just deposits or both?
8,"UK folks, did I hear Lloyd’s have prohibited coinbase withdrawals?"
9,Assumed I’d be selling pre reveal all the way up to minting @WonderPals but now it’s in my possession I wanna meet them. Looking forward to it. Congrats on a smooth mint @minasnft
10,He’s referring to purple fur hybrids https://t.co/7sP4fvBVo9
11,GN! https://t.co/4T2FVUOFAZ
12,@thejamesxrp Wonder list G
13,"RT @Ukraine: Stand with the people of Ukraine. Now accepting cryptocurrency donations. Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT.

BTC - 357a3So9CbsNfBBgF…"
14,So who’s excited for wonderpals today?! 🔥
15,"@HewTheArtist @coolcatsnft Grabbed a 2nd at 2.2 a while back, no regrets. A sleeping giant."
16,At the risk of sounding mad cringey I kinda like when markets are down for a bit after a bullish period. It’s a time to step back and focus on other stuff in life and not floor prices. If you can’t relax and step back you aren’t confident enough in your bags long term.
17,@NftSpoony @RiftyNFT https://t.co/MPVBSTE2Lu
18,Forever having my NFT world skewed by comparing every one else to @Deadfellaz and having them not match up
19,@RiftyNFT My favourite is the capybara
20,"Don’t have anything of value to add about the situation in Ukraine right now but, if there’s any Ukrainians reading this, The world is with you."
21,@WonderPals Postpone mint.
22,@NftBoyFrance Perfection 🙏
23,@Spocket9633 @Deadfellaz Lucky no skill involved
24,@GeosNFT Bangladesh 🇧🇩 vibes
25,"@hifellazzz Not liquid atm but I’ve added you, yes I’m interested 😊"
26,@hifellazzz Would you sell?
27,RT @paxel_nft: Look at that beast!! 😱❤️ @Deadfellaz https://t.co/TaqjM9qSZB
28,Purple fucking fur hybrids Jesus Mary &amp; Joseph 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
29,I think we can all agree that @psych_nft killed it and has earned a well deserved break 👏 GG.
30,@EmpressTrash Decent CV
31,150 days sober. Don’t think I’ll ever get bored of hitting new milestones. Grateful 🙏
32,"RT @nft_xelar: Alright, this got a few chuckles when I dropped it last night but no one actually answered the question. Where does a Draffe…"
33,@pinkygreenfpl Aren’t you the dude that’s buying up Russian dudes in sorare??
34,IF gonna bang hard af but gonna make some really fucking lame pfps
35,RT @L00sEtooth: iconic @CryptoDickbutts https://t.co/dQi7RrYNPM
36,@GoofeezNFT Based on that gif I’m gonna choose the sword
37,"@thejamesxrp @Deadfellaz Not really an indicator tbh, there are plenty hybrid pets as well as passes for sale which offer the same thing &amp; sales of passes aren’t electric"
38,@raj_24o4 @Deadfellaz Not revealed yet buddy but I will when it does!
39,@pinkygreenfpl @Deadfellaz Barney gone bad 😈
40,"@raj_24o4 @Deadfellaz This is a sneak peek at a one, but I have a hybrid too yes so same type"
41,Hybrid frenz easily the best who agreees?! @Deadfellaz https://t.co/RZMoE86tQD
42,I really like the @doodles merch. Why’s everyone bandwagon hating it? Just because it doesn’t have humongous fucking obnoxious googley eyed creature mfer engulfed in fur doesn’t make it bad
43,Not gonna lie if you’re not rocking a hybrid frenz what’s the point
44,The fact that coolpets is holding firm around 2.2 after the messy ass start is soooo bullish
45,What a bizzare existence https://t.co/vHYbEOkVJ7
46,Anyone know why this dude is just tweeting away like he isn’t a massive fraud and pretending like everything is okay? It’s the behaviour of a sociopath. https://t.co/c98saGeaC8
47,If I asked for a Visitor from @TheVisitorsNFT you reckon there’s a chance or nah?
48,How we supposed to get mainstream adoption when you’re giving Reddit this kind of ammunition fml. https://t.co/8vKc6SE00e
49,Is there a more undervalued project right now than @kumoxworld ? Gorgeous pfp art.
50,We want hybrid sneak peaks @Deadfellaz @betty_nft @psych_nft
51,Don’t know why I expected coinbase to have any level of integrity 😂 this renders the imminent fellaz drop pointless. https://t.co/fYLKLHkxXB
52,With the arrival of $MILK do you think we see cool pet 3E soon? Wouldn’t surprise me.
53,Anybody wanna direct me through a competent slices of time burning strategy? Im mentally checked out from NFTs and cba using my brain right now.
54,@JDay2494 I NEED ANSWERS
55,@Mau_Mau_45 @TribesNFT Haha love it
56,RT @NftSpoony: Lots of people buying #PancakeSquad recently and are sleeping on the None Bunnies. Come join the cleanest squad of them all…
57,You can make decent money on all kinds of shite but for love of god cycle those profits into fiat/crypto/blue chips when you can.
58,#FPL fam! Follow me @FantasyClarkie &amp; unfollow me here please 😊❤️
59,@nnn4642 Honestly it’s a pleasure to lose those kind of people. You’ve not lost anyone of value and that’s all that matters imo.
60,@Klopps_mug My fav account atm
61,@nft_xelar @thejamesxrp You’d think I’d be able to organise 30 grand worth of fucking JPEG’s tho
62,@thejamesxrp Nope it’s so annoying. Hope I’m wrong and there is a way but didn’t look like it does it.
63,Is there no way to change the order of my NFTs in my OS?
64,@FPL_Apina That’s what I have when applying for jobs
65,@Benny_Blanco40 @FPLFella @HinduMonkey Thanks man wasn’t sure if I went a little too strong but I thought eyy bennys a geeza he knows his way around a bantertouriam x
66,@Benny_Blanco40 @FPLFella @HinduMonkey Is it going in a frame or is it gonna be an NFT fartchode?
67,@FplChandler Most vegans previously ate meat. Most vegans didn’t used to abuse animals. The fact that it’s a discussion is perplexing. Nobody cares about anything nowadays they just enjoy being right and looking good.
68,@GoOfficeNinja Please tell me this is a joke
69,@Coinbase_NFT I don’t collect NFTs wink
70,I can’t predict the market as much as the next guy but I don’t see cool pets dropping much now with only public mint to go. Will be a free for all for scooping up those sub 3E eggs.
71,@JDay2494 Good luck buddy x
72,@ElfFpl @pig_fpl I did everyone a favour
73,@ElfFpl @pig_fpl Mechanism used to travel to different floors of a building
74,@evanodette This is kinda horrifying and would look great next to my rug pulled hash demons
75,@FPLFella @HinduMonkey Not as good as Harrison but will be decent cover
76,@MagnusCarlsen Chess
77,@ClaretFPL As far as I know crypto. Com was the last big exchange to not have been breached so I believe so
78,@ClaretFPL Ahh that. Well it’s tough to find an exchange that’s never been compromised tbh. They are insuring all losses up to 200k and large amounts should be on cold storage so that itself doesn’t throw me off as much
79,@ClaretFPL Something I should know?
80,@NftSpoony brub https://t.co/GlH8pG3NWP
81,@Klopps_mug Np ❤️
82,@Klopps_mug Buddy I was calling the likes of him condescending not you 😂
83,@Klopps_mug A lot of vegans see it as a prime opportunity to virtue signal which is sad to see. You can actually make similarities to eating meat and every day animal abuse without being condescending to others.
84,@thejamesxrp @NathanHeadPhoto @Crypto_Bull_NFT @galyverse @GalyArtist No red flags on cbs 👀
85,@nnn4642 @robotosNFT A great choice!
86,Best $6500 I’ve ever spent https://t.co/cHSYPlbx8l

89,@clockfacesNFT @_livnft @BobbyPeru24 @PANDARlN @DaleyH98 @Wavy_Mikem Love you bro. Proud of what you’ve built ❤️🍕
90,@ElfFpl @fpl_tactician Even 2 green arrows is better than 1 imo
91,Hapebeast looks absolute garbage but SURELY they meant the ear poking out of the hats?

96,@nonfungibletai Disagree completely. Having these views in private doesn’t make them better.
97,Brantly is adhering to the worlds largest religion and that’s the problem. It’s right in front of our faces but a conversation we aren’t ready for.
98,@M_Maarten Thank you!
99,Dropping the ENS until @BrantlyMillegan fucks off. Who’s with me? 🤝
