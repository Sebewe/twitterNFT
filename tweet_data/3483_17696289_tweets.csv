5,@0x_fxnction So I’ve been doing this all wrong this whole time ? All I needed to do was join his dc?
6,@andrwwang Stupid part is it actually makes sense
7,"@Nate_Rivers You had me at trust us , wen mint"
8,@jennythl_ Unfortunately most devs are in it for the quick $$ then leave. These also end up sucking the liquidity from more deserving projects where the devs /teams are grinding it out.
9,@hazer_NFT Same. I barely mint anymore or purchase .
10,@hazer_NFT 💯 that’s the sad reality

43,"@NFTLlama if you intend on collecting $70+mill you better have a solid plan and team in place beforehand. Tired of the I am not experienced BS, this doesn't cut it IRL and we shouldn't accept it here either. What he delivered was not even a joke."

51,@sxtvik Haters will always hate. 30pls artists and a team pulled this off in less than a day for a worthy cause. No one made any money from it. Still the hate 🤷🏽‍♂️. Just need to ignore them .

91,"@NFTbanditeth it's really about the quick flip, the new buyers are the exit liquidity for those who minted and were lucky to get WL. The new buyers are fomoing in , when really if they just wait the floor will drop... 3-5x I get, this is nuts."
