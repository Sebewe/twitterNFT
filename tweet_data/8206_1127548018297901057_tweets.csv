2,"@metaxis_eth @cryptaltd ... for a moment I thought you were replying to me, and I thought to myself, ""you know, maybe he's right, maybe I don't understand decentralization - if other people thought of it the same way I do they'd be working harder to achieve it on the network, maybe I just don't get it."""

5,@Law_Privacy Slashing only occurs if you act maliciously on the network. Leakage occurs when you're offline and is pennies a day if only a few validators are offline. FUD spreads more quickly than truth.

7,@Cryptovoxels1 @DAppNode I cannot publicly promote @DAppNode until they support four genesis staking clients.
8,Don't let decentralization become a buzz word. If we're going to be successful for a hundred years it must be a rallying cry and nothing less. Run your validators from your home!
9,Enterprise operators need you to believe that staking is hard and Ethereum will be most successful when they're staking for you. The reality is that the network will thrive most when we have user-accessible staking tools and EVERYONE is comfortable staking at home.

58,In a few hours the Ethereum beacon chain will cross the 300k validator mark. This is incredible progress for our network and we can be proud! Let's continue to focus on decentralization as we ask pools to practice client diversity and voluntarily hold less than 20% of validators:

76,Hiring for Ethereum researchers &amp; developers? Why not seed the fields by offering juicy scholarships for undergrads to attend university? It tells me whether you're trying to develop the ecosystem or just meet your own goals.
77,"@CryptoQand Decentralization in this context relates to layers. Some layers will be more decentralized than others, but we should resist centralization wherever we can identify it. I do believe in true decentralization, the same way I believe things can be fully centralized."
78,"Why is decentralization hard? Because one hard-working centralizer can accomplish more than a thousand people who aren't doing anything. The trick is to get those thousand people to organize 1% of their energy, then you're 10x more powerful than the centralizer. We got this."
79,@CryptoGucci Sending you all my good vibes.
80,Continued decentralization won't be easy but it's worth fighting for. The next step is agreeing as a community that no provider should control more than 20% of the validators. Our role is to set the standard and enforce it. This is Layer 0.
81,"We're still looking for centralized exchanges to do their part to improve client diversity, while I don't want to take the pressure off of them yet, I do want to say, ""Thank you"" to everyone who has contributed to this effort by believing that true decentralization is possible."
