That does seem reasonable circa 2005.

83,"@Justhere1245 @Marc_Garriga @lennysan @soorajchandran_ Great points all around.

Given the degree to which community is involved in web3, it blurs lines between CMs and PMs.

Ultimately I think the distinction is that CMs primarily *engage with* the community where PMs *build with* the community. Both people partner with communities."
