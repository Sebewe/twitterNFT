5,"@FelicianoWyller 💙🙏👊🏼 that's so nice of you, thank you. all the best for you as well 🤝"
6,"@Galaktic_Shaman @AntonymNFT Galaktic Shaman sir, kindly ape into Jordan999.eth 😁"
7,@FelicianoWyller haha ty bro. no Kevins for me! 😊
8,"@FelicianoWyller tbh I'm kind of jealous of people who have a strong belief in religion or God.
My brain doesn't do those things. I have a hard time thinking of the past or future, it saddens me. I don't wanna get too dark here,but at least I have morals and ethics to keep me sort of in line 🖤💙"
9,@Scotty_Kirby_ @BAYC2745 @psychedelic_nft this is amazing.. enjoy mates!
10,"@BAYC2745 @Scotty_Kirby_ @psychedelic_nft @BAYC2745 can you promise me either a few pint together one day, or a follow back? 😋 🙂"
11,"@FelicianoWyller haha no idea what Elden Ring is😊
and unfortunately I have no religious beliefs🤷‍♂️
but I can give it a try, 
I'll pray to Kevin, Lord of the NFTs."

15,"@DaGoatNFT if people aren't willing to hear your opinion or explanation of an issue, then it's not even worth it. conversations are not one way streets. However, you could still ask yourself if you could improve upon anything that you did to cause that reaction. #PaFam are thinkers🧠"

24,"@b8xEpie you 're 100% right. Even me, who is SUPER careful &amp; managed 2 survive this long without a ledger, absolutely needed one. I kept procrastinating, &amp;  didn't realize the extra stress &amp; alertness was chipping away at me daily. 

*You must still be hyper vigilant even with a ledger*"
