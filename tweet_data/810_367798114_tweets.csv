49,"In my life only few things matter: Love, Family, Friends, Art and Culture. Money are just money and they won't make you a happier person. So have fun, love people and look at how beautiful this planet is."
50,"People don't understand me when I say ""who cares about the price"" because they always think about the profit. Profit also exist to me, but I'm more attached to the fun of exploring communities and new projects. (and I repeat.. I'm playing with old profits, not with my mortgage)"
51,7/ If a project pumps a lot I do take profit just because I'll have more Eth to spend on something new and to explore the eth ecosystem. I'm a very curious person and I LOVE to explore dapps etc..
52,"6/ With Nft I've got a purely fun approach. I always consider lost every Eth i spend on a project. Sometimes i buy projects just because it's fun and i don't expect to sell for profit, I just love to mint something and look at the reveal. That's it."
53,5/ I've got a bag of fave crypto I'll never sell even if these are (really small) in a wallet (usually stablecoins) just to buy when a crash occurs.
54,"4/ This is why my approach to crypto and nft is the following: ""If i lose most of my money who cares? I can live anyway and I'm not worried about having a small bank account."
55,"3/ I started investing in crypto in 2017, hold tight on my bags and today everything I have in crypto/nft is merely profit. I cashed back my initial investment a year ago."
56,2/ I'm working hard every single day just to prove myself I can create something great and to push myself to my limits.
57,"1/ I'm not attached to money. I've been living with 1-2 thousand $ in my bank account for almost 20 years and I don't think money can change my life. Money will probably just make it a bit easier, but in the end being happy is way more important"
