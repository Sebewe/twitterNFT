8,@ImGlassCrown 🤗🔥🔥🔥🙌✨Wingyyyyyy!!! https://t.co/hIVAG72kPh
9,"@Anna_V_E Well said Anna~
And I'm sorry you feel this bad ... you're an empathetic person (like me) .. it's easy to get wrapped up in this sea of negativity.  Must rise above it all and let some goodness and inspiration out~"
10,"@NFTKollabs Thanks so much NFTK, appreciate this kindness and warm words!! 🙏🙏🙏🤗✨"
11,@CreationzThree That's heartbreaking.. they're too young to have to shoulder these types of concerns :\
12,"@EvEart14 Oooh fellow compatriot 🤗🤗🤗
Have a very lovely day 🔥"
13,"@Whimsicalblue15 Oooh love that, haven't used 'carpe diem' since high-school :D   Indeed, indeed! 
Have a wonderful day my dear! &lt;3"

15,"@utverzhdai thank you my dear Olnya, appreciate you friend 🤗🙌✨🔥"
16,"@ArtSandana so lets start now, why not show this wonderful art? :)"
17,"@CreationzThree Life doesn't stop my friend. I get it, I really do .. but then what? Miss the moments right in front of you? Kids will be grown and out of your live before you know it~"
18,@wildalps 🙏🙏🙏🥰 https://t.co/3QC1aKTZ5G

24,"@kuchinskaya_nft have a beautiful day Aleksy, may it be blessed and peaceful &lt;3"
25,"@vlada_glinskaya Thank you my dear Vlada! My words are heartfelt, there is enough negativty and suffering already. 
Seeing struggling artists here ashamed to post their work and starve, it makes me sad. 
Similarly, hating on russian artists and boycotting them is cruel.
Have a superb day 🤗🔥✨"
26,"@_courtsjay 100% my dear, well said.
time passes by in a blink .. regret sets in when missed~
Enjoy what is HERE and NOW.
have a lovely day Courtney 🤗🔥✨"
27,"@art_Bulgakova It should not, that would be wrong and utterly misguided.  Promoting hate is never the answer.  Russian ppl did not do this, Putin did this, cause he's a whack-job.  Much love to our Russian artist friends &lt;3"
28,@NikolinaPetolas @cryptopom1 Exactly. Each does what they can do -- no one expects more (or shouldn't).  It gets toxic when you start levelling expectations at those around you~
29,@darkmarknft Me thanks matey! Have a great day Marko 🤗🙌🔥🔥🔥
30,@D_Art2021 Safe safe safe :) Thanks a lot Dhanya!! &lt;3
31,"@NikiLeSunshine1 Thanks a lot my dear Niki &lt;3
I'm having a good day, I cannot complain .. we don't take the time to appreciate what we have, I'm making a concerted effort to do so. I am thankful, that is all :)
Have a lovely day 🤗🤗🔥🙌"
32,@jan_gonzales 🔥🔥🔥🔥
33,@glariix Have a great day Saeed! :)
34,@ideartist_eth https://t.co/s7vEvuCMsQ
35,@TheHiddenWalls Beautiful :)
36,"@graffitiongrave My pleasure, it needed to be said. I see so many Artists suffering because of some peer pressure or social stigma currently. Have a great day GG &lt;3"
37,"@RaisaNazarikova Be strong, be yourself. You're not doing anything wrong~
Have a lovely day Azanas &lt;3"
38,"@NBorousan All efforts are appreciate mate, you've done what you could! :) Have a great day :)"
39,@JamesHorizon_ Agreed! I hope you are well my friend!
40,"@itisohm GM OHmmm! 
No, I didn't come here for the money, I came here to spend mine~ hahah~
j/k -- point well made and agreed upon. Sensitivity is key, but so is survival, of ALL.  No one's plight should be minimized, even if you're not being bombed
Have a lovely day &lt;3"
41,"@cryptopom1 Yes, of course my dear &lt;3"
42,@vivianegbr 😲🤯😅🤣😇✨
43,"@_mies_mies As do I -- but we can't wave our magic wand, World doesn't work that way. What we CAN do is try our best, and it will flow from there~
Have a lovely day my dear Mies &lt;3"
44,@MonikaNFT https://t.co/8fNFF2oBOj
45,@jasimalbulushi Hope.
46,"@ryxnole Keep at it my friend, I am sorry for the fear and turmoil you experienced as a child, those tormentors have a special place reserved for them~"
47,"@jan_gonzales I do, it's really cool, I can never figure out if it's photo, digital art, or a mixture?! drives me nutz!"
48,@pete26965 GM Pete! have a super day as well mate =)
49,"@3lack444 My pleaure fren, wish you a lovely and blessed day &lt;3"
50,@navka_arts (which is oddly lacking these days. GM~ happy Tuesday fren!)
51,"@5_minutestories Well said FMS, and excellent points you bring forth. We just need to temper with some sensitivity of course .. not be like ""yah, buying that Rolls phantom with the 1000E flip i did on Xcopy's scribble"" ... 🤦‍♂️"
52,@cryptopom1 Damn ... makes me want to make some tonight as well lol~ I'll have to run a 20k to make up for it hahah :D
53,"@ArturFalco3 GM Arturooo ! I feel like we haven't spoken in months! Days on Twitter have different spatial time elements haaha~
Wise words my friend, totally agree!
Have a superb day, always enjoy your creativity! :)"
54,@cryptopom1 Dun dun dunnnn! The big unveiling soooon!! :D Can't wait for your reaction :D

61,"@lisaelsewhere Thank you Lisa -- I think ""rescue"" is a strong word, I had little to do with it besides support~ 😳✨🤍"
62,"@attilagaliba Gmmm Attilaaa, have a fantastic day mate! :)"
63,"@wildalps Absolutely my dearest Dom, we are all connected, and all important, this fact is often lost in these times .. but suffering is everywhere and everyone has their own troubles as well which may be ENORMOUS to THEM."
64,"@ompsyram GM Ujwal!! and so true, strength for others begins from within ourselves~"
65,@GoosesLandscape Gmmmmmmm! :)
66,"@vissyarts GM Vissy and sure indeed, food does not appear magically on the table because of world events~"
67,"@aeoixs Indeed my dear, so lets see what you have been up to? Anything cool? :) Have a beautiful day Alexa~"
68,"@spydenator Ahhh, my pleasure spyde ! We are all interconnected, and feeling very much the same.  I've just voiced it first because I like getting on my soap-box hahah~"
69,"@assalnajian Well said AssAI, very nice distinction made.  Have an awesome day fren :)"
70,"@cryptopom1 So get creating my friend, show me some brilliance!! :D
(and tell me about the poutine?!!? :D)"

74,@avaaaaart Gmmm Avaaaaa~ Happy Tuesday! &lt;3
75,"@MonikaNFT Agreed as a strategy, but as a broader viewpoint -- you do YOU. Any effort is an appreciated one. This notion of measuring and comparing and judging one another .. crazy, and counter-productive."
76,"@amanuel4sileshi Of course, whatever you feel helps, is your contribution, big or small.  We should stop judging each other with microscopes, it gets tiresome~"
77,"@paulwilsonimage Agreed Paul, things cannot grind to a halt. Lets see this hope and brilliance in the World."
78,"@GoosesLandscape We help in whatever way we can and as our conscience dictates. Don't overthink it OB -- just the fact that it is on your mind, is more than most can say. Well done &lt;3"
79,"@cryptopom1 Yes, and I'm the first one to get wrapped up in my uber empathetic mode -- but I stepped back, for my own sanity, and can see things more clearly. I can do more good, if I am clear-headed.
GM dearest PommmPommmm! &lt;3"
80,"@Art_via_lens GM brotha, hope all is well ! :)"
81,"@MesutNFT Damn right brotha, keep at it! :)"
82,"@lisaelsewhere You're very welcome Lisa. My family is no stranger to War either, they were POWs in the vietnam war.  But we get thru all hardships in Life.
Have a beautiful day my friend &lt;3"
83,@leeen_dah ✨🙏🙌🤗

86,"@mastaneh_kfr Not a speech, words from my heart &lt;3"
87,@OvidiuProto Thanks Ovidiu :) Have a lovely day my dear :)
88,"@NatalieIna Well said Natalie -- there is a sense of panic and pervasive  urgency everywhere, it has affected the metaverse as well. Like a ghost town suddenly .. but we need life and creativtty, all while being sensitive."
89,"@mafiafrog_NFT Very neo tokyo punk, Froggie, interesting :D"

97,"Life can, will, MUST go on~

If we don't look at the moments of happiness in front of us, they flutter on by~

Artists, you do not need to starve to show 'solidarity'.  Art should flow and Everyone keep on living, how else can you be strong enough to help?"
98,So sad... 😳 🤦 https://t.co/T0ulEAzye4
99,"@art_Bulgakova I'm pretty good, how are you dear? I finally slept a bit, trying to catch up on work neglected now~  
It's been a hectic few days .. 🤗✨🔥"
