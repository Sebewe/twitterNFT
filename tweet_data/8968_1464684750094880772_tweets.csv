91,@VitoDotTV @JohnBerryhill @TLDadvisor @stevanLieberman @360 @domai @ShaneCultra @morganlinton @andrewrosener @singhdotin @Barman @QualityNames_ What’s crazy is they were delisted and then added back on by OpenSea.  At that point I noticed a ton of OG BAYC whaling in. I got in at .09 ETH and going to hold until I replace with an actual halo.
