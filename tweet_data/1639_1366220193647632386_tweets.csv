14,@vinny_glo I fucking love u.
15,"(15/15) If you’ve made it this far into the thread I genuinely appreciate you and thank you for your time. Now, I need to get back to building and prepare for take off.. we’re headed to outer-space 🛸👽"
16,"(14/15) Also, if you want to come join the community here’s a link to our discord server https://t.co/9YGX8AifnE"

19,(11/15) I’ve also published two articles on medium which I suggest you check out to learn more about the history of Teji which can be found here 👇
20,(10/15) Now who is this kid? It’s me Jet Williams and I’ll happily dox myself because I’m proud of who I am and want people to be able to go back and trace every step along the way to greatness. https://t.co/DT1kS0Cdnl
21,(9/15) The willingness to publicly fail is this kids biggest asset. He knows his time will come and will persist and continue persisting even when he’s been given everything he’s ever asked for..
22,(8/15) He’s come to a point in his life where he doesn’t give a fuck anymore because he’s fallen in love with the process. Now it probably sounds like a terrible bet betting on the kid who just said he’s failed on multiple occasions. But guess what?
23,(7/15) A project built by a kid who’s been building things his whole life. This kid has failed over and over on multiple occasions and projects. He’s been criticised and been made fun of for putting himself out there. But you know what?
24,"(6/15) Although we don’t have the biggest team, best marketing strategy, access to influencers, bullshit roadmap or whatever the fuck these projects are trying to sell you these days. What I do know we have is.."
25,"(5/15) As of now we have 881 addresses on the WL with each wallet only having permission to mint 1x NFT. Also, not to mention even I the founder am only allowed to mint 1x NFT at launch."
26,"(4/15) To get on the @Tejiverse whitelist all you had to do was literally join the discord and ask for a spot. We never wanted anyone doing the share this, invite 10 friends bullshit."
27,(3/15) The @Tejiverse is a free to mint project with a supply of only 1000 NFTs built by a kid trying to make a genuine community and not a quick bag.
28,(2/15) The @Tejiverse is minting in two days and until now has had 100% natural growth in discord and on twitter. FYI we didn’t do any corny paid promo and have grown 100% from word of mouth..

38,"community also win. I’ve decided to take a long term approach to building, focusing on playing long term games with long term people.  

I don’t want to make money from loot boxes or from the mint of the nft. I want to build a thriving eco-system with our own infrastructure"
39,outlives me. Now you might be asking how is a free mint helping you achieve your lofty aspirations for generational wealth? Well.. in order for me to win I need to continually be providing value in building out the project. I literally can only win if my supporters and community
40,"influencers to shill, set the mint price anywhere between 0.05-0.03, sell out and boom congratulations you just made a million dollars.

But unfortunately for me, I don’t want to make a million dollars on day one. I want to create generational wealth and a product that long"
41,"Why I’m building @Tejiverse from 0 (Free Mint)
