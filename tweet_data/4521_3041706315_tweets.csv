14,"@BillyM2k Kevin gives me hope. He rose from the ashes of lies and a child Minecraft player’s delusions and showed us that there is something beautiful in every disastrous launch. 

Actually thinking about it, many friends were made via mutual rug and scam experiences……kinda wholesome."
15,@SeeriusNFT You kidding! It would be the funniest shit!
16,"@Punk_2070 That would be the only party I’d go to. I’ve had a decade to enjoy the hype clubs and Bro downs- love me those more intimate settings where you can actually talk business, art, and more."

20,@cozypenguinsnft is 7 away from flipping @cerealclubnft plot twist I didn't have on this months bingo card.
21,@mihaylova_jpg I think this is showing the Russian rations for troops have long since expired? Issue date in 2013 and expire 2015?
22,@0xHustler I mean edgy budding emo me at 12 drew hearts and Xs on skulls. 🤷‍♀️
23,@0xHustler I was more speaking to why he decided not to follow through with the claim. He didn’t have one legally. There was no tracing and the design is so vague and was never patented or whatever other special language protects that.
24,"@0xHustler Just because someone commits fraud, scams, or something like a misuse of dmca doesn’t suddenly give people a free pass to violate laws and safety."
25,@0xHustler Oh I agree. No one deserves that. People think those things can’t be reported but they can. And repeated threats are taken very very seriously. And twitter will absolutely comply with turning over user data for genuine concerns.
26,@0xHustler He also tried to say something about web2 thinking but like. That’s still wrong. Because it shows a gross misunderstanding of copyright law. So what I think happened was he finally talked to a lawyer and got told he was being big dumb.
27,@0xHustler he falsely put in the dmca. It was over the concept of using heart and x for eyes on the skull. Which he claimed he owned. He owned his version of it but it’s very different. Someone also showed a 2004 image by a child and said they deserves to dmca him by that logic
28,@Callme_Bee11 Thats interesting. False negatives suck so much. :( I hope that wasn't the case but maybe it's time for retests just to be sure. Thank you though it means a lot https://t.co/RdvWSYALAK
29,@Callme_Bee11 I'll have to look into that one. I'm sorry :( I've been cleared of any worry for lupus. They've done so many tests but I don't have any labeled diagnosis yet. I'm just stupid sensitive to any change and it's frustrating. Can't do pills for the same reason.

56,@AB84 @boredpunksnft It’s also a form of false advertising when you say a discord is at 100k as a primary method of selling and 90% of it is bots and secondary accounts due to white list grinding… 🙃
57,"@AB84 @boredpunksnft You are aware it is illegal to advertise something that paid you without disclosing this, correct? Be it payment in nft, crypto, or through cameo- you need to disclose this. 

Really hope for your sake, this is genuine. But something tells me it’s not."
58,@mr_aventad0r @OttoSuwenNFT @Loopifyyy It’s relevant to nfts in terms of a crowd funded game but they’re very transparent in the time it takes to develop things. If anything nft gaming projects should study their launch language and how they placate their community until the next update.
59,@mr_aventad0r @OttoSuwenNFT @Loopifyyy And have achieved things no modern game has yet in terms of scale and detail. But there’s also a lot wrong with it and there isn’t enough playable content that makes their investors happy. So that’s where the grief is right now
60,@mr_aventad0r @OttoSuwenNFT @Loopifyyy Yes and no. They are still in alpha because they aren’t anywhere near done with what they want to do. They crowd funded and aren’t owned by deadlines of publishers. They keep adding new and amazing things.
61,"@bryanbrinkman @Loopifyyy Alpha* we still in alpha hehe. 

Honestly, I love star citizen. It’s more of an experience than a game. I understand the unease for people who invested far far more…but they’re crushing it in what they’ve achieved. No other game comes close in vastness."

80,@0xBiZzy @NFTsAnonymous The report can be before delisting. I’m sure there’s a few projects who would love that type of shake up.
81,"@0xBiZzy @NFTsAnonymous Oh I know! It’s just a good talk. And I agree with fighting for the greater good. Maybe a group of people and project runners can get together, agree to move on to a competitor site or their own, and then allow someone to put up the dmca claim. Keep testing it to see how shallow"
82,"@0xBiZzy @NFTsAnonymous But as someone who knows YouTubers who have lost everything to malicious dmca claimers, it is a touchy subject. Again. I support it on paper. I’m a firm believer a dmca claim starts in the court then goes to the web."
83,@0xBiZzy @NFTsAnonymous So those people would dump and be loud about it being a rug when in actuality it’s not s rug at all and it’s people proving a point that OpenSea is trashtier.
84,"@0xBiZzy @NFTsAnonymous Yes and no. On paper, I’m behind you 100%. In practice, I’m worried for the projects depending which you chose. Not because of bags or personal stakes, but because people don’t respond well to what they don’t understand. And most people don’t understand the meaning of this"
