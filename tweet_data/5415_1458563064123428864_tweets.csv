41,"@JaredBlitz @worldofwomennft You can see the differences by clicking both “Give Now” links. To ensure your donation is attributed to the campaign and to receive an NFT, please click the “Give Now” within the campaign page!"
42,"@JaredBlitz @worldofwomennft If you donate by clicking “Give Now” just below the “Days Remaining” &amp; “Donations” stats, your donation will go directly to Black women in Georgia. If you click “Give Now” at the very top of the page, this is a general donation link which will benefit households in Africa."
43,@crystalhefner Would happily take some hype for this high-impact initiative for Black women in Georgia facing disproportionate barriers to wealth creation. Donors receive a beautiful NFT as well. I’m a little biased but one of the best investments out there 💙 https://t.co/by7qtTgO14

https://t.co/2iAtdXvTaT"
48,"*Anything* helps, and any generosity will certainly lead to more equitable future outcomes. However, to receive a @worldofwomennft inspired NFT by @KatalinaOoma, donate $50 to the campaign above &amp; DM me a screenshot. To have your PFP featured *in* the NFT, donate $100 or more."
49,"Returns on effective giving won’t 3x in a day, and can’t be bought &amp; sold for a quick profit. It’s more of a @punk6529 philosophy - invest what you’re able, keep learning, and see what happens in 2030."
50,Effective giving is one of the most important long-run investments we can make. My 2 largest investments in NFTs have been in @worldofwomennft &amp; @crypto__chicks. A major factor for these investments was how strongly their teams are committed to working towards a better future.
51,"On maximizing your impact: when we think of buying an NFT, we think *investment*, and try to pick the one that’s going to maximize utility ($, community, happiness, etc). But too often when we think of philanthropy, we don’t think “investment”, we think we’re giving money away"
52,"The evidence is significant: giving cash is really effective. According to gold-standard charity evaluator GiveWell, GiveDirectly is one of the world’s leading organizations when it comes to maximizing your impact per dollar donated."
53,"Just as NFTs liberate artists &amp; creators from the limitations of traditional art constructs, @GiveDirectly frees recipients of aid from the restrictions of traditional philanthropy. In both cases, power shifts into the hands of those most deserving of it."
54,A powerful effect of giving unconditional cash is that it eliminates the implication baked into traditional philanthropy that donors &amp; staff (despite good intentions) have a better sense of what's best for recipients than the recipients themselves.
55,"I’ve posted it before, but it’s important to recap why giving cash is so empowering: 

People living in poverty rarely get the chance to have any say over how money intended to help them gets spent. GiveDirectly offers recipients the freedom to make their own financial choices."
56,"If you’d like answers to questions like “Why is the program focused on Black women?” or “ Why cash?”, you can find those answers and more at: https://t.co/gMZ2rlqV4P"
57,"If you’re part of any women-led community and are wondering - beyond community engagement - what step you can take today to have an immediate impact, supporting GiveDirectly’s guaranteed income initiative for Black women in Georgia is an incredible place to start. https://t.co/zj5eun3Kg3"
58,"It’s awesome to see women-led projects crushing, thanks to leaders in the space like @worldofwomennft, @crypto__chicks, @WomenTribe_nfts, @WomenRiseNFT, @FlowerGirlsNFT and so many more setting the tone."

83,"15/ To be eligible to receive an NFT without your PFP, donate $50 to the campaign linked above &amp; DM me a screenshot. Additionally, please like this post🙏🏽 the more likes from reputable accounts means the less worried the community will be about the possibility of a malicious link"
84,"14/ To represent for your women-led PFP community &amp; have your PFP featured in the beautiful @KatalinaOoma NFT, donate $100 to the campaign linked above and DM me a screenshot of your donation. All donations are anonymous, so you won’t dox yourself to anyone besides GiveDirectly."
85,"13/ Calling every women-led PFP project to this initiative. I just spent the last 3 hours listening to @WomenTribe_nfts @nft_izzy @NFTs_girl lead a brilliant spaces on empowering women, and if there was 1 takeaway it’s that the more people collaborating to uplift women the better"
86,"12/ GiveDirectly has launched a 2-year guaranteed income program for this group. If you’d like more information on why this initiative is so valuable, effective, and important please visit https://t.co/gMZ2rlqV4P."
87,"11/ Black women earn $0.63 on the dollar compared to white men in Georgia, and face uniquely high systemic barriers to wealth creation. GiveDirectly’s mission is to tackle root causes of this disparity head-on. Starting with Georgia, and expanding globally from there."
88,10/ I challenge everyone who’s made it this far (info about your beautiful NFT coming soon!) to instead think of charity as an even more important investment (in this case in women) where the goal is to seek out the best chances at making a more equitable world most likely 🌎🤝
89,"9/ On maximizing your impact: when we think of buying an NFT, we think *investment*, and try to pick the one that’s going to yield us the most utility (in whatever form - $, community, happiness, etc). But too often when we think of philanthropy, we think we’re giving money away"

91,"7/ Just as NFTs liberate artists &amp; creators from the limitations of traditional art constructs, @GiveDirectly frees recipients of aid from the restrictions of traditional philanthropy. In both cases, power shifts into the hands of those most deserving of it."
92,6/ I think the NFT community can uniquely resonate with how meaningful &amp; uplifting this shift of power &amp; sovereignty is. NFTs are to creators as @GiveDirectly is to people in need.
93,5/ A powerful effect of giving unconditional cash is that it eliminates the implication baked into traditional philanthropy that donors &amp; staff (despite good intentions) have a better sense of what's best for recipients than the recipients themselves.
94,"4/ Giving cash is really empowering.

People living in poverty rarely get the opportunity to have any say over how aid money intended to help them gets spent. GiveDirectly offers recipients the dignity and agency to make their own financial choices."
95,"3/ I want to first share why GiveDirectly’s unconditional cash transfers are such an effective way to uplift women, and then share how donating will earn you a beautiful NFT from the talented @KatalinaOoma, a valued WoW community member &amp; artist behind the recent WoW ArtDrop 🤩 https://t.co/OLM5mfkVQV"

97,"1/ @worldofwomennft was the first NFT community I joined. Aside from the obvious upside of beautiful &amp; widely relatable art from @YKarkai, it was clear that creating a more equitable &amp; inclusive future by investing in women was top of mind for the WoW team &amp; community alike."
