10,@Ledger These ledgers are junk! I've had nothing but issues since day one. Always spazzing out and not letting me process transactions at sensitive times. Get it together over there. Thanks for the 6k plus you just cost me

14,@NFTParis2022 @OMIToppin @timthehumanbot @Zajako97 @SooltanEth @Cfold2 @patbev01 Big shout out to you for bringing this to light &amp; sounding the alarm @NFTParis2022   People like him are a virus in the system &amp; a threat to all of us. If we can band together as a community we can put an end to these scammers before they get started.
15,@EdNivris @BCBacker Indeed! Exactly what I did &amp; it paid off well 🤝

17,@yaaagin_ Sweep my bags
18,@CountofZurich @StardustNFT_ @Temptranquil Vincent wants to do a video call live where you two hash out the details. If you have nothing to hide you should be able to clear this up immediately.
19,@NFTParis2022 @CountofZurich @APInvestigators @StardustNFT_ This is a great idea! If @CountofZurich you have nothing to hide why not clear this up once and for all?
20,@NFTParis2022 @CountofZurich @grayboysdao @StardustNFT_ @HeroGalaxyNFT @nftworldsNFT This guy needs to be taken down immediately!
21,@creepztopia You ser are an asset to the team. A day one OG.. We appreciate you fam 🤝
22,@StardustNFT_ @CountofZurich Why did the entire team disappear after @Temptranquil  went in the discord? It was an immediate action...
23,"@NFTParis2022 @SooltanEth @CountofZurich @Banks @agoriamusic @garyvee @KrisK_NFT @pixelord @nftworldsNFT @iamarkdev @Temptranquil @StardustNFT_ Is he the Nathan Clester guy from Orlando, or is that someone else? He's claiming he was a victim of a hack.

24,@skuxxverse @LiamSkuxx @iamarkdev @Ukraine @nftworldsNFT This is awesome. Im going to grab a pass myself based off this act alone. Class act

26,@NFTParis2022 @SooltanEth @CountofZurich @Banks @agoriamusic @garyvee @KrisK_NFT @pixelord @nftworldsNFT @iamarkdev @Temptranquil I do appreciate you standing up and warning others. All of these scammers need to be called out for what they are. 👏🏽

28,"@NFTParis2022 @SooltanEth @CountofZurich @Banks @agoriamusic @garyvee @KrisK_NFT @pixelord @nftworldsNFT @iamarkdev @Temptranquil Thats tough buddy, sorry to hear. I do appreciate the heads up. Unfortunately NFTW devs cant control holders. I'm a world holder myself (Since early Oct.) I for one have never seen him up in chat, or heard of him for that matter. Please don't associate the team with this guy."
29,@iamarkdev @nftworldsNFT You're absolutely amazing Ark!
30,@alt61648690 @jcrcentral @BCBacker Enlighten us please.. This I would love to hear.  Elaborate..
31,"@Michael40065421 @BCBacker Big money rotates profits through each and every market sucking up as much liquidity as possible. Maybe your confidence is 0, but pros are sitting back in stables waiting to pounce. Sit back and enjoy the show"
32,"@XRPBandit @Letsgetwizardy @BCBacker DIVERSIFICATION.. You do know not everyone is on the same financial bracket as you, yeah? Veteran traders never go full speed into 1 coin. Bold of you to assume otherwise. And, those emotions.. Remove those out of the equation. Any loss should be viewed as a lesson."
33,@DerivativeApes One delay after another. You'd think after months of sitting silent the team would have this organized &amp; planned out.
34,@CryptoVonDoom @loveless_city @BrokenSeaDao @TribesNFT @SkullDungeonNFT Woop woop.. I’ll make sure I keep my eyes on your posts 🤞🏼
35,@AngelsDevilsNFT @nftworldsNFT Minted a nice pack of these! One lucky winner will get an @nftworldsNFT and ability to earn $wrld token?? Sign me up!!

39,"@BMilkseck @DeFi_Made_Here Maybe he googled pics of Ukraine, and that one came up without his knowledge? I'm not saying to be willfully naive, but please do have a little humanity here... These things are really happening"

42,@2oast @nftworldsNFT I've been saying this all along... You hit the nail on the head... Great thread! 🤝
43,@samKen @cobie I don't see one post on your page in regards to Ukraine..
44,@samKen @cobie How about the millions of innocents that have lost their lives in Congo? Why are you not talking about them? 1 human = 1 human

61,@johnpetersMD Tell us you’re upset you missed out without telling us… Tricked? This was a free mint making us passive income
62,"@johnpetersMD @nftworldsNFT Apparently you haven’t done your proper DD. Staking going live, hundreds of MAJOR projects building within nft worlds, Wrld token economy, etc all at fraction of sandbox marketcap currently. No brainer here. $Wrld is in its infancy."

78,@HaroonS98022577 @PacVotan @BCBacker 👏🏽
79,@PacVotan @BCBacker They are in stables waiting on entry signals. Money rotates through markets taking as much as they can from retail. Why wouldn’t they?
80,@Sunshine89_22 @LogicalXRP @liueemm @BCBacker You only lose when you sale. If you had bought the top in 2018 you're in profit today. Same goes for future runs...
81,@IggytheIllest The mickey mouse pfp 🔥
82,"@ColombiaMaster1 @BCBacker Veteran traders don't post absolutes. Post up your charts so I can obliterate them.. ""0 chances"" If that were the case we wouldn't see volume on alts.. wrld coin just went up 600%, market is bullish 🤦‍♂️"
