15,@BrettHornung @NungFPS Guess I’m not the right person to comment since I’m so into the community 😅 but I know at least a mass population in one industry does know the term. I feel like the wording of drop vs launch is quite unimportant in the grand scheme of things
16,I can’t even begin to imagine the emotions the Ukrainian people are going through right now. My thoughts and prayers go out to those affected ❤️

26,Just a thought but a lot of this crypto company swag gets thrown out when people re-pack their bags or get home and realize they can’t wear it out. Companies also likely throw away a lot of this stuff. Conferences should have a place where people can donate it all to homeless
27,Tough to hear all that was lost yesterday in the #opensea hack. I hope everyone can get something back at least and @opensea can help all those creators and collectors that were affected. Stay safe out there everyone 🙏🏼
28,@Pequelord @MindMakesMatter @0xfoobar I feel like @MetaMask and other wallets should include the “revoke” and “addresses I’ve given permissions to” stuff within their UI. Seems not a lot of people ever think about going to etherscan to check their wallet allowlist
29,"@Robert_Rabbit @Fwd_Party @Lobby3D @AndrewYang @TrustlessState Voting isn’t just happening on the Ethereum main chain, and actually a majority of high throughput voting has been moving to alternative L1s and side chains where you can vote with governance tokens for cents.

Plus, ETH 2 is coming 🔜"
