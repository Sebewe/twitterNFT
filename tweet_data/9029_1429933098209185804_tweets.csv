5,"@KristyT I hear you and respect your point here, but I had 10 slimhoods that I'd held since the .005 days, along with a few moodrollers, Invisible Friends didn't set the price of the previous collections, the market did"
6,"RT @mooncat2878: I own 80 @3landersNFT which makes me the biggest holder!

I love the art and the project and look forward to the future ah…"
7,Seems like the people who got to mint are happy 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/JNSGMam1H4
8,RT @HOWLERZNFT: @Impose_eth Soon
9,@NftRuddy You think that long? I was putting the line mentally at 7-14 days
10,"@tucomprends1 @otter_eth Do they not realize the people who are selling, are likely degens ready to ape into the next thing, and keep it flowing?"
11,"@tucomprends1 @otter_eth This particular argument is really really funny, because I often say things like that about drops (even if deserved, like CloneX) where the MINT price is 3ETH, but if all of the ""ETH being sucked out"" is from secondary sales"
12,Tell me again why I have seen so many people with BAYC profile pictures talking about how awful this is for the space. Do you not want to see small wallets win? Or are you salty you didn't get another airdrop of free eth?
13,Tell me again why this is bad? Did Invisible friends have a ridiculously high mint price? Did Invisible friends run an auction and take all the profits for themselves? Did invisible friends somehow force people to buy at a high floor?  (The answers are no.)
14,"Typically speaking, big whales don't grind for WLs, it's not worth their time with how often projects brick, so what I'm getting at here is that thanks to this project, 2,500 people who are likely on the smaller size of wallets, were just given a huge bolster to their portfolio."
15,"When you connect the dots there, it reads as this. 

Thanks to Motion Markus, and Invisible Friends, 2,500 people, along with loyal supports of RCC have been rewarded with over 7.5ETH in value for simply engaging, or holding old collections."
16,"@MotionMarkus and @InvsbleFriends basically rewarded those who held previous projects (Slimhoods, and Moodrollers) with a 7.5ETH airdrop for every 3 that you held. 

Beyond this, 2,500 people claimed whitelists spots FOR FREE. 

The floor on open was between 8-15ETH."
17,"Also, on the topic of Invisible Friends, I think that everyone saying this type of drop is awful for the space is selfish, and upset that they didn't get any. 

Now, I know that's normally what people say, but hear me out."
18,O/U on days til apes start to cope buy IF instead of missing out and FUDding?
19,"Transparency. Honesty. And community first. Whatever this team does, which clearly won't be WGMI Interfaces, will be great, because of the integrity shown here. https://t.co/NppWzFQxSk"
20,RT @ImAbvAvg: Respect
21,@HOWLERZNFT Think we can get a discord soon? Would love to hang out with the wolfpack and build some vibes 🔥 Promise you the positivity will outweigh the haters.
22,"@FlurETH Bit too early to call IF a loss. You're a good trader in the research and convictions you find, but I feel you flipflop on feelings too quickly"
23,"@FlurETH I think IF is going to rebound pretty hard, personally."
24,"Nonetheless, the art is very cool here, the care from Noah is very apparent, and I think that Howlerz can have a bright future.

I'm betting on people here. 

 !awooo mother fuckers"
25,"Personally think this will prove to be an extremely intelligent play a few days/weeks from now. 

I do think there may be some hurdles along the way, and I think that a window of success for this project pends on @HOWLERZNFT opening a discord that is NOT gated to only holders"
26,"!awooooo

I decided that despite me being salty, despite the FUD, and despite the lack of discord (pls fix @NonFungibleNoah) that I feel Howlerz has found a natural bottom here. 

Bought 10 around .48ETH each. https://t.co/4z7sDY7ikq"
27,@HOWLERZNFT The people who want to be there just to troll will quickly be pushed out by your community who wants to interact and talk with other holders about their howlerz. IMO.
28,"@HOWLERZNFT Ser, please reconsider opening a discord, would love to chat with you over DMs on my thoughts for why it would be best for you, your mental health, the project, and your community if you're interested!"
29,"@ol_smoothie bro it's kinda savage tho, someone just replied to me, but they're private so I can't respond, but I can see the response"
30,@ol_smoothie no1 can reply?

32,"@nftshiestyyy @HOWLERZNFT I mean, sounds like anyone who DM'd would've gotten hints. As far as fvckrender goes, sounds like his ""inside info"" was incorrect? don't really get your point here"
33,@DeezeFi Impressive that they can get that many ppl to dox

35,@FlurETH My money is on best tbh
36,"@FlurETH Really excited to see if you cement the best, or the worst, sentiment countertrade of the year"
37,@HOWLERZNFT Bro stop 😭
38,"@nftshiestyyy @HOWLERZNFT Have you seen proof of this, or are we making damaging assumptions for no reason because we’re salty we missed out?"
39,@HOWLERZNFT You should get some rest Noah ❤️ Reveal was great. Art is awesome. But engaging with people bashing your collection (Nate) and posting things people should buy is a really bad look. Come back tomorrow refreshed. Also; if you open a discord I think you’ll see positive voices.
40,"@LinusCaldwell5 @HOWLERZNFT @NonFungibleNoah So, this is how people were able to get a ""very similar"" contract to scam with"
41,"@LinusCaldwell5 @HOWLERZNFT @NonFungibleNoah What people are ultimately missing is that Howlerz did tests on testnet, and one of those tests did have the real metadata link. In fact, you can see here the TX that updated the metadata link on a testnet contract, 1d8h ago https://t.co/w4FXVa5ETV"
42,RT @pranksy: Also when 50% of the replies are promoting other projects... Great projects tend to find their own way to the top in the long…
43,@pranksy Rare time that I agree with pranksy. But spot on
44,"But you cannot try to say that Noah is the scammer. 

People are creative, and Noah continually said do not mint if I have not tweeted. Web3 cannot fix user incompetence, unfortunately."
45,"What I'm trying to say is, if you're fudding @NonFungibleNoah for being a ""scammer"" you've lost the plot. You can be mad that a ""stealth"" launch was the most hyped drop of the month, and you can be mad that the drop took long enough that allowed many scam contracts to circulate."
46,"I was able to locate the contracts the night prior, and a few hours prior to release. There WAS a testnet contract with the correct metadata URL. Deployed *AFTER* the toadz pointing metadata contract I've seen some refer to. You can see in the image attached, I found it 25h ago. https://t.co/sG15Oj1qOr"
47,"Look. I'm as sour as anyone about the @HOWLERZNFT release. It was a disaster. I was following them since mid January and got rewarded with a ""stealth"" launch that was anything but stealth. 

That said, in an effort to be early, I hunted on the testnet for Howlerz contracts https://t.co/VbJDaahdrO"

56,I heard ape follow ape https://t.co/yq90rcYuHE
57,"@ImAbvAvg Sounds about right, and while high, at least RTFKT was a well established name in the space prior"
58,"Raid party, big hype, huge price, delay delay floor death.

Pixelmon, big hype, huge price, garbage auction, floor death.

Anyone know what the next 3ETH mint is so I can full send it? Lookin to lose some ETH"

64,@mrmiracle1984 @NFTLlama @Pixelmon @Syberer His post isn’t half the impact of the art itself. Fucking atrocious. Embarrassing. And devastating that we as a community let someone raise 20k+ ETH for this bullshit. Be better community.
