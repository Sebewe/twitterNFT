Jimmy Butler u.5 3PM (-130/DK)

Butler only hit this in 13/42g this yr. Hit in 2/L10. Went over in 2/L3 so that’s why we’re getting this number. Bulls very good at defending SG. I don’t see many 3PA by Butler. #PlayerProps #BettingTips https://t.co/5Bd99cgs2h"

DK for both. CHA is terrible against C. Game should be fast paced. Had 12 rebs against charlotte earlier this year. Full unit for rebound play, only a small sprinkle on the dd.
