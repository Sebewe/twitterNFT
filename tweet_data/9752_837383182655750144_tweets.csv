4,Should we go to Vegas = Yes if you are playing two nights in LA. Simple rule of thumb.
5,"@bigthiefmusic How could you not come to Las Vegas? We are 45 mins from LA, we have more venues to play than most places you are going. People will come to Las Vegas to see you and make a vacation out of it. We have a football team, hockey, wnba... ""What's it gonna take?"""
6,@cobie Seems like a drug dealer vibe. @Upwork y’all are out of your minds. This is the the place that lets people keep their 5 star reviews if bad reviews are spread out enough in time. If you had a true review system everyone would be 2 stars. Horrible business

9,Support the god that is @zchickenlobster ! All pieces are 1/1 and only 0.05 ETH. https://t.co/Tf4hmCo22M
10,Places like @GoodwillIntl and similar foundations should make an nft marketplace where we can donate nfts for  tax write offs. Proceeds could go to a program for teaching underprivileged kids to learn how to code. NFT thrift shopping would be great.
11,@mattipietar_art You're going to make me homeless. I'll just be staring at your work on a phone under a bridge in a sleeping bag
12,@mattipietar_art Approx time?
13,@lDKCHRXS @zchickenlobster This is the gentleman’s way of properly responding to tweets viva @zchickenlobster for ever. I even own an nft of his tweets
14,If you aren’t a fan of Joe Burrow go seek help. The world in your eyes is not a correct one. Ice cream and puppies suck too?

20,His Tweets are pure gold and should be onchain for eternity. They are on Polygon using OS contract to avoid gas. https://t.co/Bg7qeB4Rxw
21,@mattipietar_art It’s one of those things where you immediately want it within a millisecond of seeing it. Tysm for your work!
22,"@MechanicalMind There’s no doubt that nfts people are right up there with vegans and crosfitters in their obnoxious promotion of their hobby/lifestyle 

It’s a bit like massive stoners the only ones trying to legalize weed. It’s not a good look and easily cringeworthy"
23,@eyebrows360 Can you link me to a debate? Would love to read it
24,"@KannaHayabusa How about owning assets that you acquire in a game? I have thousands of hearthstone cards that I cannot sell because they are tied to my account. 

I have thousands of physical mtg cards that I can actually trade and there is a market for them

Why not bring that to online games?"

27,I bought this piece from @tazzista . The story of it coming together (see below) is worth the price alone. It’s amazing to see how passionate and dedicated some artists are with their work. https://t.co/PNWugEeJwm
28,@tazzista I love your work! I’ll be getting more and tysm for this piece.
29,@zchickenlobster @LeanCuisine @beeple He has done one piece every day for 3000 days.
30,@zchickenlobster @LeanCuisine https://t.co/ZtHQIUOAuu - If you have an eth address send it here and I can make you a collaborator. Or if you want me to take it down just say so. I'm thinking a Beeple type project of one image a day? I'm going to buy the 1st/Genesis release.

42,@cobie I’m sure @saylor has a few 10 hour answers to any question. Bring him back  on if you want to autopilot the show. I want to make a white noise maker of just his answers. He’s the goat.
