3,@dotta @cur8orofearth @0xBender Personal protection is important. Web3 allows us ways to identify ourselves without directly putting us in a line of danger. I grew up in too many bad neighborhoods and know people will be willing to mug others for chump change if they're desperate enough.
4,@Jup1t3r13 @0xBender Especially if someone is just looking to rug. They only need to fool you for a few weeks tops. People didn't even find out Pixelmon was using unity assets until post reveal. Nobody would do the legwork to uncover a fake dox. By the time you realize it the rug is pulled.

55,"@intocryptoast Interesting that there are still people who are just finding their sacred flames. I wonder how many others are unaware, and how many flames will be unused from those who just don't realize they own one. Technically 520 left with 431 owners but how many of those are forgotten? https://t.co/C2aA7PZkjD"
56,"@BastardWhiskey @cur8orofearth @xnatasxswe @screentimes @intocryptoast @forgottenrunes Actually if I recall, a little over 50% of holders qualified. The criteria those who wrote lore (book of lore had just came out at the time) followed by those who held the longest, capped at a 1112 total flames. This was so newer cult members also had a shot at the airdrop."
