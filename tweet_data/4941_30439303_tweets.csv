4,"Climate interested investors, @terradotdo is taking applications for their next cohort.

I participated in the cohort from last Spring and learned a ton!

5,"@webaverse @pixels_online @Worldwide_WEB3 @decentraland @TheSandboxGame @nftworldsNFT @readyplayerme Oh wait, is it the light blue bunny? Which collection??

I totally missed this, and would love to learn more! (I poked around your documentation and couldn't find instructions on doing this)"
6,"@webaverse @pixels_online @Worldwide_WEB3 @decentraland @TheSandboxGame @nftworldsNFT @readyplayerme That's awesome! But not for avatars yet, right?

From what I can tell, you can't walk around as a CloneX because you own a CloneX - at least yet?

What you guys are building is awesome, and definitely the closest to what I was imagining!"

I don't see anything about integrating other NFTs mentioned, but would be really cool to see some beasties walking around in there :)"
8,@javipark_ @pixels_online @Worldwide_WEB3 @decentraland @TheSandboxGame @webaverse @nftworldsNFT @readyplayerme Of course! Trying to learn in public :)
9,"@BrianHoffstein @pixels_online @Worldwide_WEB3 @decentraland @TheSandboxGame @webaverse @nftworldsNFT @readyplayerme @tableland__ Woah cool - I don't fully understand it, but the gist of it is fascinating. Will take a deeper look."
10,"I've been fascinated by interoperability in NFT gaming, so dug in last night and organized my thoughts.

I touch on @pixels_online/@Worldwide_WEB3 (2D), @decentraland/@TheSandboxGame/@webaverse/@nftworldsNFT (3D), @readyplayerme (character), and more.
