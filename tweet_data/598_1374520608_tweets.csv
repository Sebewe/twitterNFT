1,After selling a @CryptoMories back to the original owner by their request the other day I wanted to get another Morie to replace him. I snagged this guy just now off the floor on @LooksRareNFT. #FaMorie https://t.co/iJx29iSelU

16,@SOLMiningPunks Exactly.
17,@SOLMiningPunks Kinda feel like everyone is numb to how much 3 ETH really is worth.
18,@tmagled @JarrodKramer8 @nbatopshot @PackripEwing Who gives a fuck if the market is flooded at this point. People will paper hand the shit out of them anyway and dapper will get their fees.

65,"@CLTguy_ETH All depends on your risk tolerance. Long term holds on quality teams are more likely to play off than the casino. You can try and quick flip but for every @3landersNFT and @InvsbleFriends there are 50 other projects that rug. You sold some of your apes ""soon"" but it was profit."
66,@nice_jpeg Throw that shit across the room to end the call. They will get it.
67,@FettyWop_ Yeah they walk you through how to connect Coinbase and binance APIs and stuff. My Binance stuff had to be corrected too now that I think about it.
68,@FettyWop_ I would go thru everything and double check their work just to make sure though
69,@FettyWop_ Most of mine were burning NFTs for other NFTs. That kind of stuff
70,@FettyWop_ Yeah some stuff needs manual adjustment but they tell you what needs to be reviewed
