16,We're working on a new token for KARMA - current token is worthless and please do not buy it. The new NFT related project is underway and we're looking to airdrop the new asset to pre-hack holders as fast as we can. Special thanks to @jaredmadere1 for helping out
17,Many have offered to help. The best help would be to stay tuned for the next evolution 🤝 we will airdrop the new asset to pre-hack holders. more info soon👷‍♂️🔨brb BUILDING! - Andrew @alee
18,"Feel disheartened for those losses, but it is motivation and fuel to evolve into the next life cycle for $KARMA. Taking in all the lessons I am grateful to have received so far, and I'm confident we can evolve the token into something 10x better."
19,"As the creator of Karma DAO, I never withdrew any liquidity from Uniswap so what we lost with the Roll hack was the total sum of contributions collectively owned by our 465 members and others outside the group that hold the token."
20,"I also think it's an opportunity to accelerate Karma's evolution into its next phase -- I've ideated a roadmap to evolve the concept of the token asset into something else. Please don't buy KARMA on Uniswap, and all invites into KARMA have been closed."
21,"I learned so much in the creation of Karma DAO and I'm infinitely happy for the value it's created for others. I'm at a terrible to loss to know that 155 ETH of the community's funds was exploited and drained with the @tryrollhq attack. The token is worthless, 🚨don't buy it!🚨"
22,"In light of the Roll hack and Karma tokens being depleted to $0.00 value, Karma DAO will be migrating to a new token and we'll also be launching an experimental hybrid project with it, more details to come, we need to build it first! Thank you and stay tuned ✅time to evolve 🌱"
