But we should always remember that sometimes teams do unconventional things and that is not bad by any means. This just means they're exploring. https://t.co/lBpykwSgpg"

6,"Friendly reminder to you, my anon friend:
Learn to support creative #NFT projects instead of cash-grab ones. Don't buy the hype, don't buy what others say you should. Buy something that you truly enjoy having.💖"

24,#ETH down? Perfect! Time to buy more 👀 Who's with me?
25,"From now on, if you decide to continue trading on #OpenSea, please don't blame anyone but yourself if something happens to your #NFT assets. You had the chance to leave the platform, but you didn't take it."
26,RT @zscuffed: OpenSea could run over your dog and y'all still won't go to @LooksRareNFT 😂
27,@EvijanJohn OpenSea being OpenSea
28,@NFTKoza @HomieGsNFT Gm homies
29,@NFTKoza Or move your listings to a marketplace that you want to support like LooksRare!
30,@PunksReload I was beginning to feel out of place. Glad to see I'm not alone!
31,"Thinking about some opportunities #Ethereum v2 provides. 

With proof of stake and lower gas fees, there will be major changes in the #NFT space. Other blockchains are working on eth integration, too  I'm telling you all, things are gonna get exciting in the next few months"
32,@statelayer https://t.co/vGxUcxv5MH
33,@logosolos I got you homie
34,@BananaM4750 @HomieGsNFT Let's go homie🚀 https://t.co/HD6DP7QCgr
35,"When it comes to #NFTs, the opportunities are endless. It's 2022 and we have yet to see famous games use NFT assets in their games. We have yet to see cars and houses be traded as NFTs.

So when I tell you this, mark my words: We are early and we haven't seen anything, yet. ✌"
36,"@jarritosxzo @LooksRareNFT They aren't worth ""nothing"". If you never believed in this marketplace, you should've never bought one and its on yourself.
Only invest in things that you believe in and in the long run you'll see profits ;) I trust in looksrare, the team and the execution 🚀"
37,@BakMller @sandboxed_eth @NathanHeadPhoto I don't understand why mint prices are so high. What makes invisible friends special? This is an honest question that I have because I see some projects with so much hype but their art seems ordinary to me and their roadmap and plan is nothing special.
38,RT @Banks: “NFT” is synonymous with “Fortnite Skin” or @ and .com ownership. Still confused as to why so many people THINK they hate NFT’s…
39,Hey there 😏 @HomieGsNFT #6628 https://t.co/28LqfG0elZ
40,"@mooncat2878 I don't worry either because I trust in the team and the execution. Long-term, $looks will make it ;)"
41,@ryancarson @LooksRareNFT We trust in the team and we know they won't disappoint. LooksRare is far more superior IMO.
42,"@rexwub See the bright side.
check eth gas price, down."
43,"I'm holding all of my $looks. Like any other crypto token, the price fluctuates, but short-term doesn't matter when you trust in the product ✌ @LooksRareNFT"
44,"Friendly reminder:
Long-term thinking is better than its alternative. If you don't believe in the team behind a product, don't buy its tokens."
