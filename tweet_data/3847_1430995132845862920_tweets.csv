31,@TripawdCrypto You’re here on my list for something
32,@TripawdCrypto You got me. I advised you to be happy for ppl. Let me guess you minted or bought low the long list of “well established” projects in your bio but not invisible friends. I understand the bitterness.
33,"@TripawdCrypto Did you read the tweet? It says do whatever you want just stop being a hater. Wouldn’t call that advice* per say. But let me guess, the well established projects you’d recommend are the ones you’re in?"
34,@liambakers @nuclearnerds I like I like
35,I don’t have any invisible friends but why is everyone so upset about it doing well? If you didn’t mint that’s your problem. Stop fake looking out for everyone by saying don’t buy at the “top” you don’t know what the top is Just ape into it or don’t but be happy for whoever did.
36,@OGDfarmer Everything under the sun is in a bear market. It will all return like it always does. In due time.

80,@LogicallyCrypto I agree with you aside from the pfp part. I think repping your set allows the community to be more receptive to hearing your message. I think many have a lot to offer the space but not always r given the chance because their pfp doesn’t show case that they r in the great game too
