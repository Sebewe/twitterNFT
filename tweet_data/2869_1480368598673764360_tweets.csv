1,@qrakeneth @doodles So clean 👀
2,"@ajsimns @MrJamesonNeat @TwitterSupport This tweet is the petition, spam twitter on it 😂"
3,@EthBlower Soon
4,"@ajsimns @MrJamesonNeat Trust me, me too. .@TwitterSupport"
5,@TwitterSupport can we get gif pfps soon?
6,Seems like people haven’t realized that Twitter now somewhat allows gif pfps… unfortunately it’s for NFT pfps only and only works on mobile https://t.co/DmbtHbQg8Z
7,@cryptobreaky @doodles Hehe no worries if you can’t
8,@cryptobreaky @doodles That’s trippy 👀 can you make the universe background into like a liquid ocean flow?
9,"@sydewalkdao @doodles Let’s goooooo, I have the same space sfiship!"

12,@notwarrenETH @doodles Doesn’t smell great though haha
13,@notwarrenETH @doodles https://t.co/T3gjtYUG9p
14,@NateAlexNFT It’s not your fault people can’t read lol
15,"@Degentraland @doodles @BoredApeYC Especially if @doodles make an on-chain game... with @NateAlexNFT on the team as an adviser, doodles will have longevity on this space"
16,@MotionMarkus Where do we start? 👀
17,"@NFTCrazyKRC @doodles If you get Twitter blue, you can have animated pfps (to some degree) like click on my pfp on the mobile version (doesn’t work on desktop for some reason)"
18,"@dandyddg @doodles We got the same ship, pretty stinky in there tbh"
19,@cozywyatt @doodles @burnttoast Might have taken the idea a few days ago from someone... (you)
20,@econoar Something along those lines
21,@fleeb_eth @doodles @burnttoast You have no idea... I also rolled a 1/8 in bladder management and mechanics
22,@nguyenhut_art Have you made this coat trait or eye patch yet? 👀 https://t.co/Bdvo0wnenq
23,This gives me a lot of rick and morty vibes... @doodles @burnttoast you killed it 🔥 https://t.co/caVa4VUhmQ
24,@BingBongGuy @InvsbleFriends Bing bong https://t.co/B8gjbYRFWV
25,@BabaBrouk @InvsbleFriends 2/5 checked off. When are you going to get all 5/5?
26,@itsorawan @BoredApeYC @doodles @RTFKTstudios @AzukiZen @worldofwomennft @RNDMCHARACTERS
27,@dTHIENb @BabaBrouk @MotionMarkus Lucky 👀
28,@fvckrender What about your @timepieces crystal holders? 👀
29,"@Degentraland @opensea You should consider turning into a chick, great UX accessibility for bars"
30,"@QUESOPARTY @FlurETH Agreed, plus the additional utility of having commercial rights plus everyone knows the 3D ones are coming out in a few months. It’s all just FUD from people without wl or just “late” to RCC"
31,"@FlurETH I don’t think people understand how long RCC has been working on building their communities, people assume IF is the first launch by them"
32,@RocketMan_NFT Burning the kush and my NFTs 🔥
33,@oOo0oO0oO0oO0o 0x1002871C44871bE0459974913a209dbAb79e3063

35,@BabaBrouk What’s good https://t.co/4W9yd9wsc9
36,@mikker @knut1783 @InvsbleFriends @MotionMarkus @Poolsuite Poolsuite x IF collab wen? 👀
37,@Louis_Capital @InvsbleFriends LFG!
38,"@Tony___Fern That’s my strategy, I focus on both but it really depends on what you’re trying to get out of tangible utility. I own a few street ware clothing NFTs because I see fit in getting those exclusive and early opps"
39,"@ScottyMac101 Nah they don’t, they said it’s not going to be to big just fun"
40,"@__chidz__ @stapleverse I figured. This is something I looked into a few weeks ago actually. Web2 definitely don’t do as well as web3, since it’s all exclusive merch and haven’t seen much resell market on them either. But I’m excited for Web2 / web3 collaboration"
41,"@__chidz__ @stapleverse I mean, what’s the difference? I see it as the same thing. New NFT projects going into branding vs old clothing companies leveraging NFTs and web3. I’d say majority of all pfp will go into branding and clothing through partnerships with existing companies"
42,@__chidz__ @stapleverse just had a 75% off sale off their currently collection. Holders got first dibs
43,@HunterGoldberg7 @InvsbleFriends I might have to buy Twitter blue to flex my @InvsbleFriends after reveal
44,@HunterGoldberg7 @InvsbleFriends Twitter supports gif profiles with NFTs if you click on the hexagon 👀 this is big
45,@cozywyatt It's all about gif traders now
46,@malibugoes @InvsbleFriends Yes... done very poorly
47,@malibugoes @InvsbleFriends Already been seeing ads for 'Ghost friends'
48,@Degentraland @doodles Luckily I work remotely
49,"@MisterArtsyNFT I thought eth is just play money, you get it back when you return it to a centralized exchange right?"
50,@0x_b1 @BoredApeYC @BoredAxelApe @FODLfi @mutant_cartel @officialboredAi Best offer on the market https://t.co/WMx8jVvfUl
51,@NathanHeadPhoto .@InvsbleFriends isn’t even out yet and I’m getting Twitter messages about ghost friends 🤦‍♂️
52,"@SocratreesMusic @Pjlozano11 @doodles I bought NFT worlds at 0.25, then sold it at 0.3 because FUD around it just being a Minecraft server…"
53,@itsdanataylor Same…
54,"@NathanHeadPhoto Tips for DeFi actions? I think NFTs taxes are easy, but I’m having a hard time with staking and constantly swapping between tokens lmao"
55,@drew_gmi @doodles That’s all you need… maybe more doods

62,"@TeddyBitcoins @0xmoxxa Gotcha, well there was another offer for $87M"
63,"@0xmoxxa How are you not going to accept a $135M offer but take a 23M. Don’t get me wrong, but that amazing returns but why turn down the $135M?"
64,"@0xDesigner Better part is that it’s free, you could get away with using POAPs as incentives rather than $20-100 gift cards"
65,@CloutedMind @doodles You don’t know?!
66,@scotty_ups Same 😭
67,"@scotty_ups Clonex and mutants. After the amount of rugs currently, idk if I can trust buying into anything new. Maybe Mfers"
68,@SNlPER__ Invisible friends 2/23
69,@0xDesigner You may want to check out poolsuite if you already haven’t https://t.co/CLnNGMBq4W
