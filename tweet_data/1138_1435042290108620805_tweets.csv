0,@trader1sz Counter trading excessive euphoria in market may be the easiest trade this year imo - don’t believe in the height of war this decoupling from the Nasdaq will last. Time will tell
1,@trader1sz Where’s your stops buddy
2,@trader1sz Certainly not useless- but in times like this people calling for a relief rally because something is oversold on the RSI seems irrelevant given the once in a decade circumstances
3,@nonaural @trader1sz People tend not to want to buy risk-on assets at the start of wars
4,@crypt0e @trader1sz Real talk- probs my biggest ever short win tonight and I feel little solace- families will be killed tonight amidst the start of the war- celebrating cash wins seems horrible
5,@Cryptoandthega2 @Trader_XO I did buddy it’s why I suggested it ;)
6,@Trader_XO Thoughts on FTM as a short? Feel it could easily hit a dollar soon
7,@Trader_XO Avax has run into a brick wall of a resistance zone
8,@trader1sz Hopium for my short

16,"Rejection of the previous ETH/usd trend line, dwindling volume, bearish divergence galore, and a clear overbought RSI, with rising geopolitical tensions, and yet I am still 99% sure my short position will be liquidated. Welcome to Crypto! #eth #btc"
17,@trader1sz @Trader_XO No more rallies just straight to a 28k BTC in one wick seems likely due to the hidden bearish divergence on the 2 minute BTC/1inch chart
18,@cryptoalle https://t.co/o8C2Vpxcce
19,@blessero @vaterimmortal @profit8lue Hidden bullish divergence on ethUSDT hourly lower bottoms on RSI and higher lows on price- fairly interesting but still bearish- feel there’s a lot of TA to suit ppls narrative atm
20,@cryptoalle Predictions?
21,"$wrld is likely to outperform $sand.The console compatibility, future gasless transactions requiring no crypto experience to enter the metaverse, are two key reasons why I am so bullish on this project. Just type in $wrld and see what all the NFT teams are building. Jaw-dropping. https://t.co/5BQHDEwPll"
22,@cryptoalle https://t.co/vGJomdXweB
23,"@cryptoalle This is the crux of everything basically- has inflation been priced in? No matter what any of us state or hypothesise we can’t know as of now. I agree this level of bond rate rising seems excessive, but so too did the 12% sell of surrounding the S&amp;P- stay safe everyone"
24,@kevin_dmnk @mackmined @trader1sz Seems safer to be long during a shitstorm damn 😂
25,@kevin_dmnk @mackmined @trader1sz And the recovery
26,@cryptoalle Seems ridiculous- if this didn’t scare the market I guess nothing will. Bullish

31,"@ChiefSovietBear @nftworldsNFT But that’s just not true- you need to have knoweldge to understand how to setup a MetaMask- and transfer tokens into the polygon network surely to P2E, otherwise you have no compatible wallet to earn, so surely that is misleading?"
32,@flairay @trader1sz Thank u sir
33,@flairay @trader1sz Crumbs
34,@trader1sz Someone explain
35,"@EthDeFiance @0n1Force @NUFC @On1force @thesevens_7 @0n1Force issue seems to be team, an issue that can’t be said for @thesevens_7 who have a brilliant team. Time will tell with both projects, extra bullish on both my two picks for nft success and I rly hope we see them back where they belong"

38,@trader1sz Back down we go
39,@cryptoalle https://t.co/q5c9tLVI83
40,@GKSteven @Trader_XO I guess I was simply viewing the two individual tokens at their major points of resistance- but I like the perspective regarding the pair- what would be your estimation
41,"@Trader_XO Hoping to see ETH 1700 BTC 32K to really start seeing value in the space- will start DCAing from that point, anythin lower is a bonus"
42,@cryptoalle Are you saying in general or aimed at a stock in particular?
43,@GoodKarm4 @adamscochran @JagerCrypto @LooksRareNFT The p/e I adapted from @tokenterminal using the percentage of wash trading given by cryptoslam
44,@adamscochran @JagerCrypto @LooksRareNFT Estimated non-wash trading of @LooksRareNFT provides it with an annualised P/E of 6.6- with the current state of Opensea could really see the logic for this being called undervalued
45,@ConMarbleHalls Was adnan januzaj also part of the deal or are we a fool for thinking he was on holiday
46,@allnick @cryptoalle How did you work out that 92% is wash trading
47,@adamscochran How in gods name did it rally
48,"Add macroeconomic conditions such as Kazakhstan’s potential ban on crypto mining (short term) and runaway inflation concerns, and I can’t see how @elonmusk hopium can lead to any real debate to this."
49,Long term gigabullish on crypto short term bearish. Feel these relief rallies are just delaying the inevitable and will be used as exit liquidity for whales. Without a complete capitulation and high volume support I can’t see how a bottom can be in. 1/2
50,So it begins https://t.co/E3YXAsbnhA
51,@cryptoalle Think ETH breaks 2500?

53,@Prototype963263 @intocryptoverse I’m not projecting I’m in a short position myself the graph below proves my point
54,"@HighStakesCap In reality, long/ short ratio is still 70/30’according to glassnode- seems majority is still quietly bullish"
55,@BrantlyMillegan Joelinton.eth
56,@intocryptoverse Why do you think people are hesitant to short when markets are looking so rough?
57,How common is getting liquidated in #crypto ? Show me your loss porn
58,@Dani_DaCEO @adamscochran I agree below red we’re hurtling to the abyss- what is the blue line a representation of?
59,@Dani_DaCEO @adamscochran Volumes too low for a bottom- too much opportunity for whales manipulation to tank price. 1700 is where I think ETH will bottom
60,"@hexonaut Gotcha I assumed as much, I love maker so the thought of that somehow unravelling scared me. Days like this for a Defi protocol are gold in the long run. Any protocol being able to deal w a 600$ million dollar vault liquidation, and come out unscathed will look highly impressive"
61,@hexonaut Will this not simply trigger a large selling of the maker token? What is the potential downside
62,@adamscochran will the buyers necessarily instant sell? i know the dai works and how the auctions operate but Is the assumption the buyers are simply arbitrageurs?
63,@adamscochran Where can you find on chain liquidation points?
64,@whale_alert https://t.co/CxXlm541yR
65,I think a #Btc capitulation to 32K is viable here.
66,@intocryptoverse Volume still poor Issa shame feel we’re destined for a capitulation down to 38k and a rally from there
67,@CryptoCapo_ Thoughts on low volume- traditionally we have always seen a large liquidation and high volume when there’s a suggestion bottom is in- what do you think is different this time very curious to learn :)
68,@cryptoalle Confident in BTC holding this level then? Assume a genera downtrend in ETH and BTC And all bets are off
69,@cryptoalle Thoughts on this price action? Dead cat bounce or could this be confirmation the lows are in
