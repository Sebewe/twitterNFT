0,@coffeebegood Yes! Trying to save for one …
1,@coffeebegood Vitiligo trait imo massively undervalued. They look so good!
2,@coffeebegood nice clone btw
3,Do you think the NFT market is in a bubble?
4,Seeing the large interest: Would you invest in a project without utility?
5,@bluechanck Never too late... its just starting!
6,@bluechanck Would go with CloneX. Resources and global reach of NIKE will be a gamechanger
7,Would you still be willing to buy an NFT without utility?
8,"The market undervalues #hapebeast rn. This is a solid project, not Mekaverse 2.0"
9,"Just sold my IF. Will be interesting to see what value the market assigns to ""pure art"" without major utility."
10,"Overall the Sandbox seems best positioned to become the leading Metaverse. Although still early, the Sandbox has the backing of celebrities and cooperations, which may prove to be valuable in the future."
11,"#Decentraland is one of the first created metaverses. Also backed by a large community, Decentraland is home to several large events such as the Metaverse Fashion Week.

A weakness is that larger cooperations generally tend to choose the Sandbox to enter the Metaverse."
12,"NFT Worlds is one of the most hyped projects. In February the floor quadrupled! 

Unique about NFT Worlds is that it is built upon Minecraft. Problematic however is that NFT Worlds doesn't have a full commercial license from Microsoft. Currently the game-token $WRLD is airdropped"
13,"The #Sandbox is probably the most known metaverse. Not only does it have a large community, but has also attracted large cooperate brands: Adidas, Gucci, BAYC, RTFKT. An extremely bullish sign!

Currently the Sandbox hasn't launched, however the alpha season seems very promising."
14,"There is currently a lot of hype around NFT metaverses. The Sandbox, NFT Worlds, Decentraland... But who is actually the frontrunner? Here are my thoughts:

A short 🧵"
15,@tisidab @RTFKTstudios I think it’s just the global brand name of Nike. Everyone knows Nike. Owning the first virtual Nike sneaker will be like owning the first Nike Jordan.
16,"MNLTH could end up with a similar performance to #CloneX vials. Key here is the fact that each holder decides when to reveal. The more revealed, the more hype, the more scarce a MNLTH becomes. Simple economics"
17,"Considering MNLTH holds “several items”, it is currently massively undervalued. Alone Fewo x RTFKT sneakers have a floor of 5.7 ETH and MNLTH is Nike’a first NFT. Something to look back in years…"
18,RT @ZollarsEth: NFT x GameFi x DeFi

#WAGMI #NFT"
58,"Team:
- @benitopagotto @clegfx @Zaptio are leaders in the space. They have a clear vision and mission 
- Backed by Nike. Unlimited resources with best-in-class network
- Collab with #murakami, a famous designer

Art:
- Subjective, but imo highly creative and differentiable"
59,"Community:
- One of the best: Highly active 
- Visionary. A large portion of the community is in for the long run, believing in the 'RTFKT Dream'
- Community builds without monetary incentive - free airdrops for space pod decorations"
60,"#RTFKT fulfills all of these criteria extraordinarily:

Utility: 
- Regular airdrops for hodlers (space pods, sneakers...)
- Usable Avatars (i.e. Zoom or metaverse )
- Physical Forging
- RTFKT x Sandbox 
- Exclusive Nike collabs?! 👀"
61,"Generally when analyzing projects I apply the UCTA formula:

Utility: What benefits does hodling provide? Roadmap?
Community: How engaged and active?
Team: Are the founder's visionaries? Regular updates?
Art: Does the art appeal to me?"
62,"2021 was the year of pfp nfts: BAYC, CryptoPunks, ...

2022 will be the groundbreaking year for avatar, P2E and music nfts. Why? Bc owners will increasingly demand their nfts to provide utility and an incentive to hodl. This is a natural evolution."
63,"2022 will be a massive year for RTFKT.

A short 🧵 on why I am bullish on #Clonex."

95,Rule #1: LIKE THE ART YOU BUY!
96,"Here are 5 projects I believe fulfill these criteria the best:

✅ #Clonex 
✅ #BAYC 
✅ #Merge (Pak)
✅ #PsychedelicsAnonymous 
✅ #filiphodas 

Over the next days I’ll present WHY I believe in each project"
97,"Most importantly never forget - nfts are illiquid assets. Therefore: YOU NEED TO LIKE THE ART. 

Nothing is more painful than sitting on art that you don’t even like."
98,"When analyzing a project look for these 3 MUST HAVES:

1. An engaging community. This is essential. Community creates demand and hype. Without a community a project is worthless.

2. Utility and roadmap. There needs to be some incentive to hodl.

3. Community engaging founders."
99,"99% of all #nft projects are scam. Especially rn many new projects are entering the space promising “the moon.” ❌

It has never been more important to look for quality NFTs. Thorough analysis is crucial."
