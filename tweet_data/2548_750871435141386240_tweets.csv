18,Some of the suggestions perhaps harsh. I shouldn’t get political. Just didn’t really hit me what a big deal it all is until reading.

hopefully it improves soon after FloorDao is up an running since it will be providing liquidity for PUNK as well"
21,@screentimes @gainzxbt ahah ya if it's a floor punk that would work :P
22,@DheerajShah_ @FloorDAO Liquidity bootstrapping pool by Balancer. Sorta like a combination of AMM pool and Dutch auction. It starts at 96/4 floor/eth and moves to 40/60 floor/eth over three days. Price goes down until end is reached but trading can happen in both directions from the start.

42,@bitcoin4bernie @next_roy ya even that gets tough tho because then you can basically get random people banned by sending them money from your account
43,@rob_mose ahah ya man such a joke
44,@godsflaw @rob_mose totally. and doubt many ppl use exchanges to hold their crypto these days. especially in canada after the last big canadian exchange (quadriga) got rugged by owner
45,@next_roy ahah ya seems like it. i dont think they know how crypto works tho lol. could probably just move money to new address and offramp as usual https://t.co/zimGN1tIVN
46,@currencyat yeah same. wish that twitter bookmarks saved the links even after the account got deleted so I could use internet archive services. oh well
47,@0xinc ahah 100%. and only way to offramp is to sell NFTs to highschoolers for cash during recess
48,"@Foobazzler lmao yeup. also, canadian crypto users buy more crypto"

using @goz_eth as my alt tho. I'll give u a follow :)"
52,"@cryptobeaker no idea. maybe didn't want to be in the limelight anymore, or perhaps just was draining mental health"

he had some great threads from back in the day I wish I had saved"
54,"@banterlytics @0xfoobar @statelayer best option in that case is probably to live off the grid, give up lavish lifestyle, and make p2p crypto trades in private for cash and/or food &amp; supplies"
55,"@banterlytics @0xfoobar @statelayer true.. definitely agree that if things get bad, going to another country won't rly help unless you also get rid of original citizenship as well (which isn't easy). otherwise original country can still hold u accountable for financial charges"
56,@banterlytics @0xfoobar @statelayer hmm.. what makes u think that? (just curious)
57,@0xfoobar @statelayer agree with this. curious if you think going to a country without extridition is important if that happens

65,@EtherealApes Great stuff guys. Love these 💙
66,"@nicovrg_ yeah I spun up a contract on rinkeby to test. first storage change was more expensive than subsequent changes to the same variable, but subsequent changes still weren't cheap"
67,@nicovrg_ lmao. last one is pretty legit
68,"@bitcoin4bernie Ya the changes will be sequential. I tested out on rinkeby and seems like each storage change to the same variable still adds gas, but I think less gas than the *first* storage change"
69,@ThatsTheGwei ahah all good. According to Kiwi sounds like this is true
70,"@ThatsTheGwei ok ya, this is my hope, and seems to make sense, since just the final state would likely get broadcasted to other nodes"
71,"if a storage variable gets updated multiple times during a tx (eg. 3 times), do you just pay the gas for updating storage once (optimized)? or do you pay gas for 3 storage updates?"
72,"@Foobazzler Wicked! Will check it out, thanks"
73,@Foobazzler Yeah I still got one in my personal wallet. Plan to hold longterm
74,"Nevertheless, I'm still hopeful that as more index funds are launched it will get included, and that we can eventually solve liquidity issues in more capital efficient ways for tokens like GLYPH that represent collections with &lt; 1k (high value) NFTs."
75,"On a personal note, GLYPH was always one of my favorite tokens, but with NFTX's pivot to automated inventory/liquidity (as opposed to purely focussing on index funds) it is less relevant, as it tends to get very little turnover."
76,"We plan to sell the ETH from it for USDC, but to hang onto the GLYPH for now.

More info here: https://t.co/nzuOq5it2J"
77,"We will be withdrawing most of the GLYPH/ETH liquidity this week as part of XIP-20 to set aside USDC.

The vault &amp; token will still technically be live, but since the NFTX Dao supplies 99% of liquidity for it, it will become quite illiquid.

Just a heads up for any holders."
