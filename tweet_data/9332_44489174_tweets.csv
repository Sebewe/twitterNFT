23,@WarBirdUSA @TRF_Stories @salesforce You clearly don't understand what the term 'misinformation' means. Setting that aside... so the fact that credit cards have been stolen and misused to frequently means there should be no credit cards? How about the usury by banks considered legal?
24,"@TateOrtena @ezekiel11 @gootarts @TRF_Stories @salesforce How precious for you to reject a technology that empowers people with just a mobile phone and internet connection to earn a living wage, while having no apparent problem with the use of electric for convenience and entertainment. I guess we have different values."

26,"@gootarts @TRF_Stories @salesforce Anyway, time for me to stop trying to save you people from yourselves. The better technology will always win. I so wish that more of the people who care about things like the environment would be among the first movers, who always benefit more due to risk rewards, but so be it."
27,"@gootarts @t13trad3r @crk_NFT_ @TRF_Stories @salesforce This is a lie.
Point of fact, it simply does NOT use that much energy.
Do you not check the accuracy of things before repeating them?"
28,@gootarts @theloudestno @scarytreebones @TRF_Stories @salesforce The fact that something can be copied doesn't mean the technology that could copy it should be rejected. Or do you have a beef with Xerox too?
29,"@Trevorwhatever4 @t13trad3r @TateOrtena @gootarts @TRF_Stories @salesforce 100% THIS!
But what's stunning to me is the number of otherwise discerning individuals who wouldn't normally trust those sources not only swallowing their lies wholeheartedly but repeating them without ever checking their facts first."
30,"@ezekiel11 @TateOrtena @gootarts @TRF_Stories @salesforce She's probably an American on top of it, with her govt waging financial violence on so much of the world, her neighbors 'wasting energy' on conveniences like massive TVs, and meanwhile attacking the tools that help America's victims."
31,"@TateOrtena @gootarts @TRF_Stories @salesforce The difference is value. I have never owned a TV, so to me the ability to save 3 minutes each day not waiting for it to turn back on is worthless. Meanwhile, financial instruments empowering people worldwide has a lot of value to me."
32,@TateOrtena @yslburner12345 @TRF_Stories @salesforce There are many things we do that are not 'green' in that they use resources. The question is about value. Any amount of resources used for something you don't value is too much. But there most definitely are NFTs on chains using no more electricity than we're using chatting here.
33,"@TateOrtena @ezekiel11 @gootarts @TRF_Stories @salesforce Really, no. It's not a ponzi scheme selling hyperlinks. I mean it can be. A lot of things can be. But it can also be so much more. What a poverty of curiosity to not even bother to find out what it can be."
34,"@gootarts @TRF_Stories @salesforce Second, the only one that uses more energy than a small country is the Bitcoin blockchain, but NFTs aren't on that blockchain! LOL
And as for even Bitcoin, guess what uses more electric than all the BTC mining in the world? TVs left on standby in the USA alone. Hypocrisy!"
35,@gootarts @TRF_Stories @salesforce This is where you're repeating lies and misinformation. 1st there is no 'the blockchain.' There are hundreds of them. Some use a lot of energy and some use about as much as you and I are using having this convo right now.
36,@yslburner12345 @TRF_Stories @salesforce ... the hypocrisy is in the workers protesting what is largely internet usage while working at a company that moved more and more workers online more of their workday focused on 'the cloud.'
37,"@yslburner12345 @TRF_Stories @salesforce The thing is, there's only the perception of mixed messaging because people misunderstand NFTs. There is absolute consistency between offering a product like NFTs and being environmentally friendly. You just have to pick the right blockchain or use other measures to offset..."
38,"@TRF_Stories @salesforce The degree to which misinformation has taken hold in the minds of seemingly intelligent people is amazing. The same people complaining about NFTs are streaming video hours per day, leaving their TVs on standby, and using clothes dryers instead of hanging clothes to dry. LOL"
39,"@yslburner12345 @TRF_Stories @salesforce Messaging yes, because people are so deeply misinformed about NFTs and so thoroughly unwilling to learn."

58,"@Web3Disciple @BT I think it's the same for all of us.
My guess is that the use of Chainlink means the NFT lands in our wallet only around the time of reveal, so when @BT says reveal is tomorrow that means we'll see nothing until tomorrow. No placeholder even."
59,@BT We won't even see that we have the NFT at all until reveal time? Because it shows my collection as empty still.
