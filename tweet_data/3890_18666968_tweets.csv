52,"@YorkNew5 Also the keys are separate from the character so you could potentially flip those keys later and keep the pfp. Either way, we’re using these characters in the story so we’ll be licensing them from holders to include in other media."
53,"@YorkNew5 Understood. Some of these are slipping by at minimum bid. If you have anything to sell in the Metaverse, this is the move, but we open in the summer so it’s a longer hold."
54,"@YorkNew5 Yes. There will only be 50. 
Starting bid for 45/50 is .369E. 
5 of them start at .75E. 

It’s more of a real estate play with limited spaces. There’s a 3 year lease on retail and/or commercial space in the city for NFT sales/displays. PFP is a bonus w/ limited commercial rights."
