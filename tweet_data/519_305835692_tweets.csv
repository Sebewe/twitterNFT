40,@brycent_ Some axies are as low as $60. Nice time to sweep if you know what to look for
41,@dude27lebowski @YummySkyPuppy @bigmarinara Damn bro. Instead of having a conversation you chose violence https://t.co/6etBeFGFl4
42,"@dude27lebowski @YummySkyPuppy @bigmarinara You sign a contract when you join a gym, too. Btw a ""smart contract"" isn't a legally binding contract, it's a series of ""if this then that"" statements. It's code."
43,@NFTartCo @OGDfarmer @GordonGoner @AJPokaPlaya1017 Thank God. Tbh it wasn't very bunked to begin with Ripp's article was so stupid imo. Totally unsubstantiated claim
44,@NFTartCo @OGDfarmer @GordonGoner @AJPokaPlaya1017 I saw this on a thread on Twitter. People there are just crazy trying to find anything
45,@Crypto_Sisters Just started learning today 🙌

57,"If Ethereum EVER gets to $10k, @BoredApeYC at 100 ETH is $1,000,000"
58,"@agtmadcat @bigmarinara I'm 100% sure that being involved in the NFT community influences my opinion and makes me biased. I honestly don't see it though. The anagram thing, the 18 teeth, and the similar art style honestly seems like ripp was grasping at straws for some inflammatory/viral response."
59,"@itstylersays Quick, sell some NFTs 🤗"
60,"@ImliterallyETH You'll always be an ape in spirit. And youtre still in the NFT fam, fellow cool cat"
61,@agtmadcat @bigmarinara I read that article and I just don't think there's enough to prove it
62,@CreatoriousRex I may or may not have borrowed @Tropofarmer's iPhone
63,@zsolt_kroki 🤫
64,@bigmarinara But it's possible this is just a coincidence. It looks more like vintage old school americana to me. The ripp article has like 3 points that are all pretty wishy washy tbh
65,@bigmarinara I'm sorry but a similar style doesn't mean apes are secretly neo Nazis
