43,"@Elena_Graham Agree, any way is okay. Just saying what resonates with me. Been donating both quietly and publicly for years now."
44,😘🐶 https://t.co/WcVe5PP7pk
45,"@Ololotta Main reasoning is this - if someone wants to do good, just do good first. Donate first. Buy Ukrainian art first. 

Then figure out how to sell own art, as an example. Instead of using own art as a proxy to donations."
46,"So for me, @QLiebin is a great example — his work can stand on its own, while he donates all his proceeds, quietly and without fanfare where he thinks it will help the most 💙💛  https://t.co/pcX97hUoe4"
47,"I think the best way to help is not to promote your own work in order to sell and donate, but either donate directly and quietly or uplift creators who can benefit directly. 

I know it's a controversial topic, especially after seeing so many photographers doing that."
