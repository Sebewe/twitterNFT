26,@Sadgirlsnft Woah coming back to this. Forgot I retweeted! I picked this beauty up at 1ETH - could have had her for .08 but I’m still stoked to be part of the SGG movement 🔥
27,@beaniemaxi This presents an interesting offshoot of influencer groups. This is something I think the community would balk at but not something completely out of the picture IMO
28,@beaniemaxi Solutions will arise to address this inefficiency. Big voices are (hopefully) doing research and promoting. This is a service that will eventually be commditized either through pay to access investment groups or another means.

64,Imagine the drops that could have been saved if there were proper observability and a rapid deployment pipeline
65,Deploying a contract right now provides little way to remediate issues that arise in production
