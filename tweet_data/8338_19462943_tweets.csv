18,"@NathanHeadPhoto That's a fact, but I'm looking to change that when I'm more liquid."
19,"@0xPerc @FlowtysNFT Bruhhh.. that's awesome! Do you have a store online? Might have to get one and review on my blog -&gt; https://t.co/prIaNu6Vr8

Great work!"
20,RT @VitalikButerin: An opportunity to support Ukrainians here! Proceeds go to civilian efforts helping Ukrainians suffering from the war.
21,@0xPerc @austinNFT420 @FlowtysNFT Those are sick! Where'd you get them done?
22,@NFTbark Took profits and bounced around the time people started having their shit stolen.

42,@nftushy Yerrrrrr https://t.co/FPq4NyXoxq
43,@garyvee I reached out to the project and they haven’t said shit about these bogus ads. Makes it seem like they’re allowing it or perhaps using an affiliate service for mint?
44,@0x_fxnction @instagram @garyvee I reached out to the Dan guy. Dude was sadly hacked months ago and can’t regain access despite being verified. Wild!
45,@BoredApeGazette @opensea Dude didn't come to play.
46,"Tell me you lack creativity, without telling me you lack creativity. https://t.co/F6t0XIMQke"

50,@steveaoki @a0k1verse Hell yes
51,"@superphiz @coinbase @krakensupport @prylabs Not all, but a good amount of my ETH has been staked on Coinbase since they opened that up months back."
52,@superphiz @coinbase @krakensupport @prylabs So I’m fucked with what I staked?
53,"@Gee__Gazza Lol I go to bars solo all the time and talk to everyone, man or woman. My wife doesn’t give a shit because she trusts me. So weird."
54,@PrimeApePlanet There's an advertisement for your project going around FB that says it's GaryVee backed. Are you paying ads on hacked FB pages? Very scammy.
55,@VickijEth @garyvee Looked that guy up. He was definitely hacked. Lol
56,"@thedansalem @bloglovin Homie, was your FB hacked, because it's shilling some fake crypto."
57,"@DrifterShoots @WMVGSalesBot @VANS_66 So fire! Congrats, dude."
58,@LeahLamarr This! I have so many NFTs just for the art.
59,"Love me some @manishie_. ""Chat, see how he is gingerly holding her?"" @SypherPK you got some explaining to do LOL 🤣 https://t.co/v3YeJ75s6W"

74,@n3aR93 https://t.co/zXq1DOvfpv
75,@WhoWant_Smoke @the_x2y2 I love the added competition for the space. When Coinbase throws their hat in things are sure to get interesting.
76,@WhoWant_Smoke @the_x2y2 Not sure how I feel about them yet.
77,@0121eddie @thingdoms Welcome!
78,$looks like I know where I’m buying from now on.

81,"So if I revoke access to my important NFTs only, is that enough? Or should I revoke access to everything connected to OpenSea?"
82,"@AJFromDiscord @opensea To be clear, the migrated listings they recently asked everyone to do?"
83,"@BitBuster01 @opensea I believe it's a phishing attack, which is common for this type of thing anyways. I could be wrong, but I would just not click on weird links."
84,"@NFTMintQueen @NFTCryptoChicks This has to be a parody account, right?"

90,@Walshy_Eth @Jacobtheape @ShrewdCharlie How does this work exactly?
91,@cheekyliris Facts
92,@NathanHeadPhoto I hate it. Now my real #mayc yellow bg reminds people of the derivatives.
93,@outlinedcloth @Cryptoon_Goonz That looks nice. Love their art.
94,@bndaughety @BoredApeYC I hate you https://t.co/neFqNNC7zx
95,"@FreekyCrypto @a0k1verse For sure. @steveaoki fucked with NFTs for a while now, and is the perfect media/celebrity to test the waters with his fans. I think he is going to bring some really cool value to his passport holders."
96,@AltcoinDailyio Dude is a joke. Old money is a joke.
97,@JetSetTogether Nice. I bought a bit more and decided to stake it. Going to ride it out for a week or so.
