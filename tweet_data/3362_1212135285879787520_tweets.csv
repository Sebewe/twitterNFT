66,"It's a bright future for provenance, longevity and stewarding the fantastic first year of Foundation Collection mints 🌄 https://t.co/IFhrzYpOaz"
67,"RT @boomkatonline: Broadcast, finally

⤳ https://t.co/XQyKbbJFgR https://t.co/nXnUKfmD0J"
68,13/13 I believe that no marketplace offers a better product for photography/albums/immersion to web3. Custom collections are the best photography tools out there. 📸 🛠️ 🏁 https://t.co/SDHwgpHeZl
69,"12/13 Thx to the widest range of creators in any one format, @withFND gives us a front row seat to @Reuben_Wu @KateWoodmanArt  @halecar2 @l4artiste @aaronricketts_ @bugindreamland @chadwicktyler @noahkalina @shavonnewong_ +++'s growth so far"
70,"11/13 Already pushing the limits, @obscuradao's Who We Are collection held the most simultaneous auctions in @withFND history + most mints/splits in a single day https://t.co/PRWI52Bcj1"
71,10/13 DAO coordination may replace much of the industry’s agency dependence in traditional markets. More control given to more photogs will bodes well for diligent cultivation of the art form
72,9/13 Photo has also been an industrious medium ready to organize + activate quickly in the NFT space. Great collective thought + stewards are developing in DAOs like @obscuradao @theRAWdao @fellowshiptrust @untitleddao @TheCitizensDAO &amp; many more
73,8/13 1/1s make the most sense as photography. It’s an industry where artists even burned their negatives to control scarcity / limit duplication https://t.co/C6gsz4s17m
74,7/13 The serial nature is traceable and the viral aesthetic value is immeasurable— a picture is worth 1000x words. Photo books are exactly portable to custom contract collections 🗂️
75,"6/13 In web3 identity is valuable and photo can be portraiture. There’s no better simile to the success of PFPs—if you don’t own a Punk or WoW or personally create art, your avatar is likely a photo."
76,5/13 Watching @jessewldn @Iiterature at @mediachain_ approach the old world at Getty &amp; Intl Center of Photog in ‘16 was a no-brainer. Private archive &amp; pay are ancient 🦖
77,4/13 Web 2 distribution is vampiric &amp; devalues photos to Likes. web3 enables the viewership of IG with the support of Getty Images.
78,"3/13 A professional photographer has slim chance at independent + sustainable income as a gallery artist. Commissions are unreliable, print &amp; pub are much tougher now."
79,"2/13 NFTs have touched many industries, but none have been as apt for revolution as photography (so far). In web3, power is in the hands of the creators. And almost everyone is a photog (from baby pics to 📲)"
80,1/13 Ruminating on photo NFTs &amp; their importance to me (&amp; @withfnd) 🎢 📸 🌐
