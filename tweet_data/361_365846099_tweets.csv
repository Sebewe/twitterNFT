4,wait so our solution to rising inflation is to spend less? https://t.co/ATD8fcIi9q
5,"@tylerwho_ @EB7 why?

Instead, we deserve more efficient markets where scammers don't get to run the markets. That's a better outcome because it's a productive outcome.

""we need a bear"" is a lazy way out"

12,"@DennisonBertram - Call out the scammers 
- don’t support the projects
- markets should get efficient enough that scammers don’t take over the space
- hopefully we have an efficient enough market that scammers don’t last long, and ecosystem keeps growing"
13,"I don’t like FB/Insta or any of the content on those platforms. I think it’s all absolute garbage.

$fb stock still made insane returns in the last decade.

38,"@cozywyatt @CloutedMind @BoredApeYC @doodles @RTFKTstudios Im gonna get a complete set shortly! Really love what’s happening in that ecosystem. Also hate what’s happening in the pfp space.

“Vibes” and “merch” is not enough. 

I had a cloneX for a hot minute, but sold it off too fast :/"
39,"@CloutedMind @BoredApeYC @doodles Agree.

I own none, but I’m becoming insanly bullish @RTFKTstudios as well. Their deliver/approach is so great.

Not sure about anything else rn for pfps.

Most of these new pfp drops don’t actually need to be NFTs. They’re essentially web2 projects (YouTube/insta/merch)."

60,@KeyboardMonkey3 You sent this same exact tweet 50 times last year.
61,Currently only long-term bullish on NFTs that are solving interesting technical problems. Or being creative with delivery (not just creativity with art).
62,"@itsmechase @Iam0xB0B There are devs and teams that continued building through the bear. There are even more people building this time around. That to me is growth

However, there is still tons of junk that attracts tons of retail money in the short term. Like you said the WL/AL stuff is total junk"
