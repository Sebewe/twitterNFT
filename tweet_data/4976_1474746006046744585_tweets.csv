5,@superf3st @homing_818 @ZeyadSamra @wd8915 @melissaatan @ijihun46152523 @AoAve @Grifff101 Thank you. I like to respectfully candid. When I didn’t add two more people to the original request I felt like I short changed the opportunity so I’ll be patient. Music changes lives so I’m happy to see how things develop and stay active
6,@superf3st @homing_818 @ZeyadSamra @wd8915 @melissaatan @ijihun46152523 @AoAve @Grifff101 For those who didn’t make it - let us know how we can get in the discord and get WL.

22,"6. Community Partnerships - We've partnered with @LongLostNFT  and @moonsofmarsnft. We're connecting other projects with our P2E game and competitions (Fall Guys + more). We all win together.

The #disruption is real. What other projects can say the same?"
23,"5. Community - I love being a chubby and spending time in Daily Kaiju Night Twitter spaces, pop-up fireside video/audio Discord chats - playing games and joking around, going over the latest Alpha in chat, and helping others answer questions in gen chat. The #chubbygang is legit. https://t.co/Uqm6Vmq2V7"

d.) Tickets for events/concerts at the ChubbyVerse Sandbox 
e.) Play at the Chubbyverse Casino https://t.co/7DdFo6O5n5"
25,"4. $Crunch - staking your chubby (infographic included) provides #crunch for the Chubby ecosystem.
Utilizing crunch provides opportunity in so many ways to burn it.

a. Minting Gen2 Aliens and Serums (Completed)
b. InfiniteWorld Blockchain P2E Trading Card https://t.co/FRAK3xtlyH"
26,"3. Innovation-It's not only creativity that drives innovation but execution. The team is developing on multiple road map items in parallel.

a. Gen2 Mint (Live)
b. Sandbox Properties ⬇️
c. InfiniteWorld Blockchain P2E Trading Card Game 
d. Merchandise
e. Chubby Marketplace https://t.co/bqVXG87O9r"

From discord hacks to re-strategizing the Gen2 minting process -@JAMPZER @YosepArt  and team have pivoted time and time again while pushing the roadmap https://t.co/2rtDPBIOCj
28,"1: Culture -a positive and empowering community. The hardest part about Web3 right now is navigating it alone with confidence and security. The leadership, mods, contributors, and holders love to safely educate and provide solutions for people new and old into the chubby discord. https://t.co/cRgcTKViuR"
