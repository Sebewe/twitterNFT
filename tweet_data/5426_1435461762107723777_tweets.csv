44,"The whole premise of nfts is there IS something differentiating the person who purchases it from someone who right clicks it.

Digital artists who use adobe or blender as their paintbrush can now sell their pieces as art and even receive royalties when they get resold."

55,Aped (only half) back into $LOOKS for a few reasons: 1. mental sanity. 2. More and more OG users are falling victim to @opensea's ui bug. 3. @LooksRareNFT dev team has moved super fast. 4. Still want to hodl ETH for the long term rebound #NFA
56,"@cash4kromer By right clicking and saving it, you’re just spreading the exposure of an nft collection you don’t own."
57,"@cash4kromer You right clicking and saving my nft just increases exposure to my nft and the nft collection, like free marketing."
58,@cash4kromer Bored ape yacht club grants IP to their collectors so they do own it just as much as a movie studio owns the IP of their movies
59,@cash4kromer @NathanGuergis @ThatJamOnToast You can download a movie illegally because it’s a “digital asset” but still go to jail.
60,This one hurt to watch. @opensea should’ve notified people with below floor inactive listings BEFORE announcing to the world this bug exists. @rarible at least canceled transfers. $LOOKS built batch canceling in only a couple days. https://t.co/AnfmRSP9Dw
61,"3 MAYC's and a WoW just got exploited by the @opensea glitch. If you listed, transferred wallets while still listed, then transferred back, your original listing is still live. Be careful y'all."

71,@crypto_coop_ kinda funny that this tweet is littered with scam bots
72,@ElYogui_PA great read!
73,"@MasoudYazdanfa4 @ck_1337_ @opensea @LooksRareNFT I agree with CryptoMax on this one. Seems reactionary and slightly disingenuous. Might not be the founders decision though, a16z just wants their bag."
74,"It does feel like @opensea is getting squeezed from both sides. $LOOKS is staking their claim with the web3 crypto natives, and @coinbase is aiming to grab the marketshare of the mass consumer normies."
75,"@fadetospace @OX_Ditto @FilmBrief @NadavAHollander Interesting point. The curve in their tokenomics is steep. Current APR's are not sustainable, but with the nature of previous token airdrops failing right after launch, they needed to incentivize people not to just dump their tokens."
76,@keechcuts @GoldenXnft @LooksRareNFT Yeah not being able to sort on price is really the only major thing preventing it from being usable. @LooksRareNFT
77,#NFA if I didn’t have all my liquid eth in $LOOKS I probably would be flipping #HAPEBEASTGANG rn.
78,"@jack why are you shitting on #web3, literally the internet integrating with the blockchain, as the CEO of SQ (recently rebranded as Block)? Know your customer… https://t.co/umCZDzjxVf"
79,"@DrJones0305 @LooksRareNFT Yeah so both buying and selling counts in the way that you laid it out. right now it’s only for certain collections (most of the major ones). Idk about the looks amount for 1eth, maybe someone in the discord knows if you’re still curious."
80,@DrJones0305 @LooksRareNFT Yeah someone made a dune chart comparing LR to OS: https://t.co/DtvR2OlfWp it should also be 50 times the total weth fees collected that day (since the fee is 2%)
81,@DrJones0305 @LooksRareNFT The 2.8665m goes to just the traders that day. (Doesn’t include $looks compounded from staking). The weth collected in fees goes to just those staking looks.
82,Looks like @pixelvault_  were quick to renounce their affiliation with @beaniemaxi. I don't have the best insights on the PV discord but apparently their relationship was already deteriorating before this event. https://t.co/9fgSmvW85J
83,This is quite the damning evidence of straight up illegal behavior. Interesting to hear @beaniemaxi's response and what will happen with his relationship with @pixelvault_. https://t.co/CIbM2tPLVK
84,"What I think is currently misunderstood is #web3 and #NFTs are actually de-anonimizing the internet. The public ledgers store everything. This doesn't necessarily mean doxxed IRL identities, but as this space becomes mainstream more self-doxxed, non-crypto-anons will join."
85,This is pretty much going to determine if I'm going to take a long term position on $LOOKS or paper hands this ish. #NFA #DYOR https://t.co/2q3TfsS0XM
86,"@_dmda_ @LooksRareNFT @opensea I share the same sentiments. The devs have their work cut out for them, but the opportunity is there."
87,"When there’s a gold rush, sell shovels.         Loaded up a wee bit more on $LOOKS. The @LooksRareNFT team still needs to fix core product issues and much of the transaction volume isn’t sustainable yet because of wash trading, but they are in a prime position to make it happen."
88,"Hands down my favorite nft project is @heaven_computer and it's not even close. #WomeninNFTs is trending, but not enough people know godmin is the realest of them all. https://t.co/gFyFLBqma9"
89,When there's a gas war to claim a token drop meant to compensate those who paid a lot in gas just so they can dump before everyone else...#WTFairdrop
90,"@LooksRareNFT Changing the time on listings is #1 (price changes rapidly, no one want's to list for 1 month or pay gas to delist). #2 is sort by price ascending. #3 fix issue of unlisted items still showing when toggling ""Show only listed items."""
91,"Third free token drop I've gotten: https://t.co/4iE1ycWE4M. Sold the other two immediately (OpenDao, ENS). This one's a #HODL for me dawg (#NFA). I love OpenSea for what they've done, but this is the path they could've taken if they listened to their community and made a token."
