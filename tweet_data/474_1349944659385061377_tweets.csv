One more unwritten rule is:

Wtf is my exit plan. Do u have patience to hodl 6 months or 6 hours?

Profits love patience. And if you are not overinvested patience is more abundant.

Wish you all happy investing and always DYOR.

Life is good 🔥"
13,"8/9

Recap what does DYOR mean?

1. When is project launching? Are you buying pre or post reveal?
2. How active is community? Is the team still working &amp; delivering announcements post reveal?
3. Who tf is the team? Their reputation?
4. Analysis of own budget. Am I overinvested?"
14,"7/9

My rule of thumb is never invest more than 10-15 percent of total liquidity on 1 single project.

When I bought 30 @KarafuruNFT it was huge conviction play and also less than 10% of my liquidity.

I believe they are a project that is doing so many things right."
15,"6/9 👀

Lastly once thing that does not get mentioned enough:

Take an analysis of your own budget before you invest.

If you have 10 eth and invest 10 eth in a project you are balls deep in it now. If floor drops you are probably not sleeping at night.

Why u did this?"
16,"5/9

The reason why this is so important because it will decide if:

A) will team rug or simply suck at what they do. 
B) will they continue building/have build reputable things before.

Teams are the heartbeat of communities and as we’ve seen with @Pixelmon, experience matters."
17,"4/9

Now that the project is going well something you should have already done is:

Who tf is the team? Who is the artist?

This can matter depending on project ambition. You need yo know team experience, ambitions, budget, reputation."
18,"3/9

Second, how active is their discord post reveal — Is team still working and being engaged?

- Engagement and further announcements post reveal tend to help floors recover.

The blend of marketing, community involvement and gram announcements are essential in this stage."
19,"2/9

First, you should consider the following:

- When Is project launching? Is it revealed yet or not?

If you buy pre-reveal expect price correction post reveal.Usually prices dip post reveal. However strong projects tend to recover their floor very fast."
20,"1/9

What does DYOR mean?

The worst mistake you can make in NFTs is buying “the next KONGZ” or “the next BAYC” etc.

You should not invest just based on “oh it’s similar. It will probably surpass X or Y project” but invest on actual research.

I love the NFT space however with so many bad actors entering the scene, WL destroying communities and so many rugs and scams it's becoming important as collectors and investors to protect our assets.

Trust doxxed, low-mint (low-risk), builder &amp; organic growth communities."
33,"2/3

As we are still in the Wild West of NFTs, un-doxxed teams are still the norm however as more $$ flows in projects and situations like this happen it will become the norm for teams to EARN the trust of a community, be doxxed, and have a proven record."
34,"1/3

Projects like @Pixelmon are destroying NFT space.

3 ETH ($10k USD) mint then hiring artists from @Upwork to deliver on art is pure disrespect to the community. 

Decentralization is appealing until teams perform day-time robbery and people cry for customer service. https://t.co/zjLHRBOz52"

43,"My big concern with NFT market:

- White-lists have destroyed community ecosystems and allowed scam NFT projects to take advantage of alpha communities to sell-out.

47,Actually like them but not paying 1 ETH to botters lol
48,"Congrats to who got @HOWLERZNFT however:

- If you didn’t have a bot you were not getting one. Must be less than 1k unique holders with multiple wallets.

- gas war and lack of information during “stealth” mint $600k to a scam account is not the way to mass adoption of NFT space."
49,"Seems fake contract made $600k doing this scam.

Confirm all is legit before throwing money at a contract. https://t.co/N8LpxMWFkZ"
50,"Stealth mint causing more harm then good to NFT space.

Gives scammers leverage to mislead others with scam websites.

Be careful out there everyone. https://t.co/pxtuTTqxeK"
51,@elikongz Respect to @Nate_Rivers for doing that
52,"NFTs are still new and great projects and making this space better however…

I believe we won’t see mass adoption until mindset of those building this space is more focused on creating, building and enabling others to succeed.

Hoping 2022 can be the year that does that."
53,"Money doesn’t change people, it magnifies who they really are.

I am seeing allot people get rich and the reoccurring message is “how do I make more” instead of “how do I help others make it”.

New buyers are getting f’d with rugs everyday with overhyped projects."
54,lol legit seller shaming is one of the most toxic thing about NFT communities. https://t.co/5bxjToHneY

57,"“Why would NFT market crash if just stock and crypto dumping?”

Many individuals are over-invested. When you add fear and emotion it leads to bad decision making.

Buy the fear, sell the hype is where wealth is made."

60,"Interesting how NFT market reacted to stock and crypto bleeding markets.

It was crazy to see ""hype"" collections being paper-handed vs organic growth communities like @CyberKongz holding value rather well.

Organic growth, in the end, holds value most. People value their jpegs &lt;3"
61,@mubarak_marafa @InvsbleFriends the way I am? lol it was fun talking bro. have a good one

63,"@mubarak_marafa @InvsbleFriends the market decided this for many collections that crashed. at 10 eth its very risky and I just pointed that out. I said ""learn to read"" because I never said anything about team. they did their job, some made profits but those that fomo are at risk."
64,@mubarak_marafa @InvsbleFriends if you knew how to read I already answered your question. My biggest concern is people knowing how to make their own decisions which tbh is not that common. If you can't agree with a view that challenges yours maybe you are the toxic one?  ;)
65,"@mubarak_marafa @InvsbleFriends if you knew how to read I already congratulate peeps that flipped well just adviced people not to fomo into collection at 10 eth floor. dont want them to end up like you with $20 in their wallet ser. its not about ""what can the team do"" kongrats again to all that profit in this. https://t.co/PccmBzBKJy"
66,@mubarak_marafa @InvsbleFriends ahah when did I ever say anything about the team. all I said is watch out for fomo 10 eth floor is get rekt zone ser.

75,@hectornft @VolatileTA @digitalgrails @InvsbleFriends respect your take too. being a bit careful is better than FOMO thats all im saying lol
76,@hectornft @VolatileTA @digitalgrails @InvsbleFriends to each their own. all projects look like mona lisa until floor drops

Once floor drops I want to see all the people saying how good the art is lol"

82,@smerkyyy_eth @InvsbleFriends @KarafuruNFT check my account im still holding all mine; at least their art and roadmap is better than this garbage tbh
83,"imagine congratulating people who made a profit off this and then warning others not to FOMO then getting called out for it lol 

Tbh sometimes I lose confidence in the entire NFT market wtih crap like this

I guess I should just shut up and just watch people get rekt lol 😂😂😂 https://t.co/QLU1qq0iaE"
84,@digitalgrails imagine being dumb enough to fomo and buy at these prices then prices dipping. crazy ! I guess that never happened before; guess floor can only go up maybe tomorrow its gonna be 99 eth floor BUY BUY BUY
85,"@Rimjiano @artnarchitect @InvsbleFriends first off idaf about honoraries. I care more about people FOMO into overvalued stuff more tbh its sucks liquidity out of market.

Also calling out an overvalued floor and telling people not to fomo is how ""these influencers"" do it lol ok bro"
86,"@InvsbleFriends for those in comments:

Like I said if u made profit congrats but def not the best vibes from this project. 

same as @MekaVerse reached a high af floor for no reason this is giving me the same vibes tbh 

just encouraging people not to FOMO too hard and lose money."
87,"Congrats to those that made some profit from this however not too impressed with @InvsbleFriends 

Market already not doing the greatest the last thing we need is another project to take out all liquidity out of entire market.
