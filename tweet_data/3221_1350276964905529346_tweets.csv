2,Hi @Syberer — I am the creator of the Kevin holder group chat. I’d like to work with you to preserve this special piece of art (yes readers — art) while you also push PixelMon forward. I think this can be beneficial for both of us. Feel free to DM me!

5,@ChampagneMan Hi! Shoot me a follow so I can get you added to the Kevin holder chat.
6,"Love it or hate it - The Kevin saga has been one of the purest Web3 moments we have seen in a long time. Holders have come together to chat, share memes, pitch development opportunities, preserve the art, etc.

There's a lot more depth to this than just jokes. #KevinStrong"
7,@fvckrender We are working to put this movement in the right hands. You can purchase without a guilty conscience 🤝
8,@voxviking This wrapped contract remedies that issue.

A “Wrapped Kevin” contract is under development to preserve the original Kevin from being altered."

Have you secured your Kevin, anon? https://t.co/YQf4N25BYY"
57,@FmftrevorH @exitliquidity1 There are seven billion people on the planet but only 85 Kevin’s. It’s best that we don’t hog them

62,"I couldn’t resist — I had to buy a Kevin. There are only 85 in existence. It may end up being one of the most memorable and recognizable NFTs from this period of NFTs.

Only one left for sale 👀 #KevinStrong https://t.co/8ssGdbOHwS"
63,@beaniemaxi Physical edition? Haven’t seen it. One year.
64,@Mike_Crypto Thank you!
65,@Mike_Crypto Excuse my stupidity but what does AMM stand for/mean?
66,RT @nypost: Bitcoin donations pour in to Ukraine military amid Russia invasion https://t.co/iIiTdjxoKy https://t.co/P7M0sCJFxS
67,"Surreal to see a nation posting $BTC and $ETH wallets in wartime.

We have come a long way. https://t.co/sD0WADalEQ"
68,@LancePackstrong Cheers to you!
69,@lemasterlearner TGIF! Have a great weekend!
70,"Any interaction with this tweet = TGIF
😎🍺😎🍷😎🍹"
71,@bottl_rock Would consider it but may need something else to sweeten it (Spinner floor is 118 atm)
72,@Doris_Burke_NFT Thanks. It will be super interesting to see how many pop back up over the next 1-2 weeks vs. remain unlisted
73,@Doris_Burke_NFT Is this due to an OpenSea change or is this organic?
74,@Gee__Gazza Do we know if this is even NFT related?
75,GM ☀️ Or should I say — Howdy https://t.co/SZWoPvtZKi
76,@nairb621 @Cosmo_886 Thank you!
77,@nairb621 @Cosmo_886 What website is this from if you don’t mind me asking?
78,"What will have the higher ROI moving forward? 

Would love to hear why! 👇"
79,@BoredApe6271 @dryjuul @takashipom And who will get early access do you think? Just CloneX or any RTFKT holder?
80,@dryjuul MFlower?
81,Well well well. Look what we have here https://t.co/qXvhKqh2no
82,@Toprak3d Save the NFT portion and donate directly
83,@KeyboardMonkey3 @stancrypro Thanks for the response! Seems that your warnings are more directed toward the late-2021 buyers than those that have been in for a while longer (which makes sense)
84,"@KeyboardMonkey3 @stancrypro Legitimate question — what is your rationale of heavily investing into $MAGIC while also calling NFTs a bubble? In the instance of BAYC, it seems they intend to develop a similar ecosystem"
85,"RT @jenkinsthevalet: Please let days like today serve as a reminder for what’s truly important in the world. Step away from the computer, c…"
86,"@RichardEngel @EliotHiggins Pretty huge clarification, Dick Engel"

94,@dividebyzeroeth @Drucritt @the_freightrain @fasteddiegloor Can do you one better. I once paid 8E for Punks Comic #1
95,@cryptowalker16 @PrimordialAA Yup… It’s been a long few years. Gotta remember all the good stuff we still have going! Silver linings 😃
96,"@cryptowalker16 @PrimordialAA I agree on the financial side and our historical involvement. On the other side, history has shown us that appeasement just leads to further aggression.

Either option sucks. Hoping that somehow it can be cooled off before a full-blown invasion"
97,@PrimordialAA I think NATO has to defend. Every option is grim but allowing this to go unchallenged is extremely dark
98,@kallianassa_ @InvsbleFriends It was 15 for a moment 😅
99,Love it or hate it — @InvsbleFriends is proving that WL grinding is a legitimate career option right now 🥴
