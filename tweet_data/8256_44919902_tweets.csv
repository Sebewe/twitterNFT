69,@MagicalBeaker @jimseven I can't really explain you rollups if you are not willing to learn. Just read about zero knowledge proofs if it interest you. Kind of tired of trying to explain stuff if you are only looking for arguments to fight me instead of trying to learn.
70,"@pwb @MagicalBeaker @jimseven There are chains with no fees, but it's a bad idea. Don't change my words 😉. Even visa charges you for paying stuff to prevent spam in their servers."
71,"@MagicalBeaker @jimseven Immutable x is 0 fees for example, if you use rollups or create your own is possible to create 0 fees. Btw 0 fees is dangerous. Create a bot that trades infinity and you can break the chain. Fees (even small) prevents spam as you need to pay something to spam."
