2,"We managed to bring GPT-3 data on-chain, and store it in an efficient way.

But, that's just the beginning.

@SheetFighterNFT is going to continue to be a hot-bed of creative technicals feats.

Next up?

Our Ethereum &lt;--&gt; Polygon bridge."
3,"Of course, that means we have to parse and split up that long string, when you query the contract for the Sheet's metadata.

But, that's not a problem.

Getting the Sheet's metadata is a view-only transaction, so it costs literally zero gas to parse the string. https://t.co/4EVt2jAFag"
4,"Instead of storing each string as a separate variable, we stored them all as one long string, concatenated by a pipe character.

Why would we do that?

To reduce the number of slots the data took up in storage.

Fewer slots = less gas https://t.co/s0kw6zzwBF"
5,"After getting the GPT-3 data on-chain, we had to figure out how to store it.

The main challenge was reducing the cost of gas. 

Each sheet had five different pieces of text we had to store, so we did something we hadn't seen done before."
6,"If alarm bells are ringing in your head right now — good. 

You noticed that anyone could've easily altered ""_flavorTexts"" and arbitrarily named their Sheets.

That's where the signature came in, which let us verify that ""_flavorTexts"" was the unaltered text created by GPT-3. https://t.co/I3vYt7BMDf"
7,"But, how did the GPT-3 generated texts actually get on-chain?

The answer lies in the smart contact's ""mint"" function.

When you minted a Sheet, you passed in the GPT-3 generated data yourself. That's the ""_flavorTexts"" parameter.

This all happened under the hood, of course. https://t.co/uVe88ZIRau"
8,"When users (lovingly dubbed ""Sheet heads"") minted their Sheets, something cool happened.

GPT-3 generated texts that represented their Sheet's name, and the names of it's fighting moves, were placed on-chain. https://t.co/V6NnB4JWTD"
9,"The goal of all this was to build something totally new and push the boundaries of what we could do on-chain.

The lore and high production value of the project were huge components of @SheetFighterNFT's success on the day of launch, as were the pretty unique technical nuances."
10,"It's no secret that storing data on Ethereum is expensive — brutally expensive. 

But, there was another problem, too.

The GPT-3 generated data had to be created off-chain, and users had to bring it on-chain, themselves. That presented security risks.

So, we had to be creative."
11,"12 days ago, we did something we'd never seen done before.

We took GPT-3 generated data and placed it on-chain on to Ethereum.

36,"By grouping smaller datatypes together, StructB uses only two slots.

On the flip side, StructA uses three. https://t.co/c5bVqCWcq9"
37,"More slots = more `sstore` operations,

and `sstore` operations are WILDLY expensive.

You can use fewer of them by properly ordering variables."
38,"Why should you care about the order of variables?

The EVM breaks up storage into 32-byte slots.

• uint8 takes up 1/32 of a slot
• uint256 takes up an entire slot

But, why does that matter?"

57,"By approaching Web3 protocols as regular old products, you'll learn all of the valuable context that makes it easier to remember the individual pieces.

Now you don't have to memorize protocol details in isolation."
58,"How is it solving that problem?

In other words, dive deeper into the protocol's implementation, and understand the ""how"" of what they're doing.

E.g., Chainlink is building a decentralized network of oracles to allow data to enter contracts in a decentralized way."
59,"What problem is it trying to solve?

All protocols are created to solve a problem.

Now that you know the target audience, what is the specific problem they're having?

E.g., prior to Chainlink, Dapp developers were struggling to get real world data into contracts safely."

68,"@hexonaut I think the real problem is that the network effects Ethereum accrued don't translate to L2s.
