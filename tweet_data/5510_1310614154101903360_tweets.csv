15,"It can sometimes get hard to keep tabs on everything that goes on in the Vayner eco-system, but luckily there’s Jeremy out there giving you the 411, deciphering cryptic messages, and is a great guy to interact with."
16,"Web3 being so overwhelming, so vast and so ambiguous, we’re lucky to have people out there to shed some light for us. Today I want to thank someone who’s provided me with a lot of value and whom I’ve yet to give anything in return: @jeremyknowsVF"
17,I use Twitter to stay connected to current events and to my community. I use twitter for inspiration; to follow builders and operators who relentlessly pursue their dreams. And I use twitter to learn from people who are incredibly generous with their time and knowledge.
18,"Why do I use twitter? 🧵

I think that Twitter is a fantastic tool to have in today’s day and age. One that can provide you that edge in life if used constructively. Needless to say, I’ve been much more active on Twitter since first being exposed to #Web3."

37,"Maybe Unpopular Opinion: A lot of brand new NFT projects are talking about their low % listed. That's great for showcasing the supply of a project... but very few of those same people are talking about demand.

If a project has no demand, it's worthless. Even if 0.1% listed."
38,KPMG just joined the community! https://t.co/C8WI2vibqm

53,"@RickyDebler Hey thanks a lot Ricky! I sniped the Pomp on your list, love @APompliano. I’ll be sure to check some of the others out!"
54,@MattyRos5 @WGAlphaGame @RealCryptoCoach @housegmoney @ajv I think it’s very very possible. I feel like now is a good time to stop fortifying and start going after GMoney with JMo. How much longer could Alpha Game run for?
55,@Stefan_Boberg_ This feels like the routine of a champion! 💪
56,@MattyRos5 @WGAlphaGame @RealCryptoCoach @housegmoney VaynerPack slowly creepin up
57,@RickyDebler Lmao I can relate to spending hours looking at the same things and expecting something magical to happen. What’s your fav podcast?

60,@WGAlphaGame @RealCryptoCoach @housegmoney 😂
61,@MattyRos5 Only reason I would want some more sheep though is because not sure yet if we’ll loose our current sheep by breeding them
62,"@MattyRos5 I was thinking farmers too, some people in the cord had some good points about Wool but I feel the multiplier effect farmers can have will really help with Wool generation anyway"
63,@MattyRos5 @kateshafe @wolfdotgame MattyRos is a Wolf Game OG and gave me a lot of good advice starting off. Appreciate you brother! ❤️
64,@berto_reb Stonks are a thing of the past https://t.co/LTISgsx6WU
65,@MattyRos5 @WGAlphaGame @PantherQB19 👀
66,"@kateshafe If you believe in a project I think it’s never too late :) especially in this case since the prices have dropped.

Macro risk is probably the biggest risk of any project these days though!"
67,"Wolf Game Strategy:
You have 1 ETH, what you buying?
-1 farmer &amp; 1 land
-2 land and 5k wool
-20k $WOOL
-1 sheep"

82,"@griffey2481 We are my friend, at the very beginning stages!"
83,@griffey2481 Your right! It kinda does remind me of crypto 😌 There was a lot of criticism and controversy about some of those early day platforms. But they paved the way for todays audio and visual streaming services that we all take for granted.
84,@HirangaG Crazy how far we’ve come! I can only imagine what our kids lives will be like when they’re our age.
85,"@AndrewTogg Lol for a while, Napster was King 👑"
86,@HirangaG Lmao I remember Jeeves very well! I used to spend hours asking Jeeves questions of which he could properly answer 0.15%. But at least he was a great listener 🤣 https://t.co/2cFqk9Kgna

94,@maxybinks What platforms are peaking your interest these days
95,@maxybinks 🤣 I Put a lot of thought into it haha
96,Considering staking ETH for a year so I dont’s spend it all on NFTs.
97,"@LukeJdoteth Yeah, the guy has crazy conviction in Bitcoin. I guess that same conviction is what got him to where he is in the first place!"
98,Michael Saylor is the ultimate degen CEO and he knows it.
