5,@LXV @if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe Well their banner did say stop all mandates which isn’t something you can hate. But yeah I’ll just leave the discussion for you guys ✌🏽
6,"@IHCphil @if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe Haven’t there been discussions to implement it? And discussions to censor ""fake news""?"
7,@LXV @if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe Can’t speak for the US or Canada so fair game if life is normal again for you guys
8,@sqsarasota @if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe Germany is considering banning even the last free messaging apps (Telegram…) because the state can’t read &amp; censor what people say on there. They passed a law that allows the state to read any private conversations you have and look into your phone just if they have a suspicion
9,"@sqsarasota @if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe I put wearing my seatbelt in the same category as the mask. But even if fake news ""kill"", freedom of speech should always be prioritized. If we draw the freedom line at how many lives we save it would end really badly. It’s a very slippery slope (look at Germany)"
10,@mitkopitko7 Damn. Let’s hope no one is. I hear about nut allergy a lot (often from the US) but never met someone who is allergic to nuts. Is this just a coincidence or is nut allergy regional like lactose intolerance

21,@KampTed @sqsarasota @if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe I can’t speak for the US or Canada but Germany is totally going in the wrong direction and oppressing their population so I’m just assuming similar things are happening over there and that’s why there are protests

35,@IHCphil @if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe I thought they stand against forced vaccinations. But I could be wrong of course…
36,@sqsarasota @if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe Honestly I don’t care about the masks. They’re mostly symbolic but wearing one isn’t a tragedy. But I respect everyone who protests against forced mandates and against censorship / propaganda
37,"@if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe Oh alright then. What a smart response. I see, we’re educated here"
38,@if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe Maybe I misunderstood what the truckers actually stand for so correct me if I’m wrong but I thought they stand against forced mandates.
39,@if_you_see_kaye @FiskVelox @juliaioffe That’s true and I agree with you. There’s always that side. But there’s also too many dumb people blindly following everything MSM or the state says
40,@typpyl @FiskVelox @if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe Did I say that?
41,@sqsarasota @if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe Is it about masks? Pretty sure it’s about forced mandates but ok.
42,"@FiskVelox @if_you_see_kaye @juliaioffe Sure. If we have learned anything in this pandemic it’s totally not that the state shouldn’t have too much control over people, right?"
