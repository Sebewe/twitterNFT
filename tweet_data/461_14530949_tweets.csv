0,@rhearajj it’s a game changer I have a few like that and it made email usable again
1,@rhearajj create a filter that sends every email with the word “unsubscribe” in it to a separate folder
2,@0xfoobar let's call it equirekt
3,@supergremplin lmao 😭
4,@scott_lew_is @NFTethics pretty sure most of the nft community doesn't take the nftethics account seriously anymore
5,@0xfoobar @scott_lew_is highly advise forwarding all of this accounts tweets to /dev/null.
6,@alexisohanian need their store to accept eth already
7,@RyanHodge @draftcheat tailored goals would be cool. i'm unbearable to be around during cut season. always hungry 🤣
8,@0xaleister lol those are two i'll ride to zero. fire sale on almost everything else
9,down only? https://t.co/xcjyS1ojSC
10,@draftcheat @RyanHodge low body fat only increases tinder hit rate performance. I'm too old and married for that shit. just need to balance good health and enjoying foods accordingly
11,"@draftcheat @RyanHodge i'd get in but i hate cutting. i'm in a cut right now but anytime i get below 12%, i want to kill everything around me"
12,@CaleCrypto i am concerned for anyone with NFTs that has ambitions of price going up tbh
13,@aradtski fully onboard with this. never taking a liquidity pump for granted ever again.
14,"@aradtski good sir are you tweeting under the influence? not judging, i often do the same"
15,@thepropgallery the entire space is super high risk
16,@0xfoobar imagine buying non-otc
17,@DailySportsGeek https://t.co/g5c5gN5HuD
18,"the attention span of a modern-day meme is probably like two weeks. i treat my money with this rule in mind. you do with yours whatever you want, i won't hate. I'll probably buy your bags when you're down 98%"
19,here's her bf https://t.co/sXjtohVAcJ
20,"@0xGav also the crisp bubbles popping in the background hit hard af, love it"
21,@bee__wells gm sir!

23,@SenquezPick marijuanas are a gateway to cake
24,@ClaireSilver12 @Sothebys Soooo cool and right next to Drifter two of my favorite artists 🥰🥰

28,gm 🌈🚀 https://t.co/oCNITtdxup
29,"@beaniemaxi Hate him or love him, Beanie’s take is right. Granted, web2 was just a prolific use of xhr (AJAX for the laymen). perhaps once we identify how to properly monetize community ownership (without vapor emissions), web3 can lean on that. Until then, agree."
30,@poopie great job dude they look so good 🤌🏻🤘🏼🌈🚀
31,@chris_chynoweth @0xBiZzy yea rosenberg is a sharp
32,@0xBiZzy Eminem but he doesn’t even know or care that his manager bought him an ape 🤷🏽
33,@greg16676935420 she’s no longer your girl brother
34,@CaleCrypto Looks like something I’d crush after leg day destroys my soul
35,@DiscoverXnft might buy one tbh
36,@DiscoverXnft once everything is at zero Coinbase be like https://t.co/xI2FoFhD2N
37,@digging4doge bearish until i see wtf it does :)
38,@thetechcreative I might need to find someone who helps spoon-feed their clients more down in south Florida.
39,"it's not that i don't want to pay taxes, i just get more anxiety at the thought of doing my taxes than the thought of going to jail.

it's 2022. just send me a fucking bill."
40,@Blockworks_ uniswap fixes this
41,"@0xfoobar yeah, imagine thinking we can educate the dumb out of people? glad you weren't compromised"
42,@0xfoobar can't tell if sarcasm .. leaning sarcasm
43,@ste_ve_e hey :) mind if I dm you? re: steve.eth
44,@ohihello1 happy birthday! :)
45,@Blockworks_ i don't think bitcoin works like you think bitcoin works
46,@bee__wells gm chief ✊🏼
47,"@0xinc yah. i think universe xyz will be good, though. should wipe the floor clean with looks/x2y2. i believe in Tyler's vision and his capability to build products. disclaimer: i own $xyz already"
48,@0xinc speculation but i am guessing it all went to shit when joe left
49,@punk9059 @ElectionDayMad1 with the liquidity equivalent of zero at that price point.
50,@fasteddiegloor @czbonick or just don’t buy NFTs that start at 11e dutch auctions
51,"also if you think 'art' doesn't need experimentation, i present to you @lphaCentauriKid"
52,@EmpireMaker2 top two are all i need. do enjoy nigori sake once in a while though if I'm going to calorie binge
53,@Blockworks_ hell of a drug https://t.co/W6D5GRJ9fa
54,@cathsimard_ i like u
55,@0xlght correct. i like you
56,bet on teams that are going to experiment and aren’t afraid of failure. the ones not experimenting are guaranteed to fail. we have no idea what a successful NFT project will look like in even 1 year. that requires breaking the rules. off to space we go
57,@MVillameta plenty of great solidity resources out there these days
58,tbh I’m equally anticipating the smart contract code for space doodles as I am the art. looking forward to reading it
59,"gm ☕️💚🌈 this fella is ready to head to space

61,@Fiskantes polne pizdetz
62,"on a more positive note, i am stoked that doodles will launch into space tomorrow. the animations, sound, and technical details are highly appealing. looking forward to seeing a timeline of spaceships 🚀"
63,@Debussy100 @bitpixi if you need some weights i got some heavy nft bags you can use for deadlifts / pressing
64,@sartoshi_nft lmaooooooooo
65,@punk3178 i've also recently diagnosed myself as bipolar when it comes to this space
66,"@sebgomezcr i think context is impt here. floor could be priced at non-zero, but also have zero liquidity. eg: avid lines"
67,@heykelseyj @dr__rossi ohhhh zoom into the text and take a shot for me kels! 💚
68,"fwiw, I think IF has cool art. what i think is insane is the hopium valuations. 666 supply of Grifters are trading at less than 10e, so excuse me if I'm not sold on hype holding a large part of the current valuation. let's see where it's at when attention shifts elsewhere 🤝"
69,@0xfoobar bell curve opportunity missed
70,@DrifterShoots goose bumps shit
71,@Marceezy2 god speed on your gambooool

82,@gainzxbt storz &amp; bickel 🐐
83,@sergitosergito @MrsSergito Is she doing power zone with the homie Wilpers?
84,@0xinc kinda inevitable when you can just print as many as you want no?
85,@toadz5490 😭😭
86,@OGDfarmer same it’s an immediate reflexive block with certainty I’ll never buy
87,@0xinc unless I can smoke it no thanks
88,@bitpixi I’ve got a 5yo and almost 12yo that can do better art than ded dragons for u
89,@bitpixi down bad bro
90,everything that is wrong with our industry in one tweet. sucking liquidity out from real projects and artists. I’d be embarrassed to have released this garbage with my name stamped on it https://t.co/PYbiNSxEU5
91,@zachxbt Lmaoooooooo dead chip https://t.co/WI5eTgE5Ox
92,@DrifterShoots Looking sharp af bro
