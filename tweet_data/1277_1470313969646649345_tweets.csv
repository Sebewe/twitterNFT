The problem occurs when people abuse money to indulge themselves."

9,"NFTs are not just a commodity, they are a promise. That's why rugpulls hurt so much."
10,"@ShaanVP Crypto is a tool for the people, not for governments. Decentralised money benefits individuals more than institutions. Crypto proportionally benefits the same people that war harms."
11,@epolynya Historical storage is not that big of a problem. Existing data availability solutions are sufficient and storage capacity in general will continue to increase.

13,"As world tension increases, the distance between populace and governments increases. Anti-nationalistic sentiment will rise. This is good for Bitcoin and other decentralised networks."
14,The origin story of a web3 protocol contributes as much to its value as the functionality itself.
15,"Origin stories are no where more important than in web3. Bitcoin has its immaculate conception that nothing else can replicate. Even if you replicate it functionally, it won’t have the same value."
16,It is much easier to increase scalability than it is to increase decentralisation.
17,Fintech companies not in web3 are NGMI
18,@itsdanwu Fair distribution is the most important way to prevent this. Yes whales will buy up tokens but they won't be able to acquire a significant enough portion to control governance.

20,Financial freedom is the right to allocate one’s assets as they see fit. No matter how degenerate.
21,Democracy defends freedom of speech. Web3 defends freedom of finances.
22,Banks take all of the upside and offload risk to investors. Defi gives investors all the upside and is transparent with the risk.
23,Decentralisation means that bad actors can use it as well. This isn’t ideal but it is better than someone suddenly deciding you are the bad actor and you get completely cut off from the network. Credible neutrality benefits civilians more than governments.
24,It is in times like this we must remember that the fight for freedom never ceases.

27,Wars rarely start due to moral issues. Economic interests are by far the greatest cause of conflicts.
28,"NFTs are culture. When you own something, you tend to want to show it off. NFTs are the key to strong community engagement."
29,@iamDCinvestor the web2 brain drain is real
30,Fees are the most important thing to get right with web3 protocols. It’s a careful balance between security and usability.

32,@punk6529 Consensus is law.
33,There is no greater act than the relinquishing of power.
34,"Remember, fundamentals only get better in a bear market, not worse."
35,@ExitedCxC It means decentralisation will win out in the long run. Centralised entities inevitably fail due to bureaucracy or failure to adapt to changing circumstances.
36,Money is a public good. It is too important to be left up to a few men.
37,"Myth: decentralisation can't scale.
Fact: centralisation can't scale."
38,"The most important idea I learned last year is to share your work publicly. If you aren't doing this, you need to start now. It doesn't matter if you feel like you have nothing to contribute, everyone starts somewhere."
39,@_erod @NadavAHollander @allencito @opensea Did you receive a phishing email or get your NFTs stolen?
40,@_erod @NadavAHollander @allencito @opensea likely from other phishing sites related to NFT projects

53,100% uptime is an underrated feature of web3
54,The right to transact is the right to participate in society. Restricting this is a violation of the 4th amendment. https://t.co/bupS9W9eYl
55,"web3 companies should behave like whales trying to maximise the value of their tokens. Instead of trying to extract value from users, deliver value to their tokens that are also held by the community."
56,Arguing against proof of stake is inadvertently arguing for exponential resource consumption and environmental impact.
57,"A lot of NFTs right now acts as Proof of Work tokens, where community engagement is the ‘work’. 

PoW NFTs will prevail with gaming but with more fun."

65,"@pseudotheos If a blockchain has a marketing officer, that's a clear sign they are trying to sell you something."
66,web3 is not just about money. It is about value. There is a large overlap between the two but do not confuse them.
67,Being a part of web3 means taking a stand against centralisation. Give me decentralisation or give me death!
68,@sassal0x only top signal is you tweeting ser
69,"@pseudotheos ehh, it’s kind of like an ICO except with a working beta. Perhaps it should be more transparent to investors that the code is not finished."

77,"Governments will adopt Ethereum. 

Why? 
Running their own centralised chain for fiat leaves them vulnerable to attacks. Biggest jackpot ever, huge target for nation states. 

Use Ethereum and gain the security of the whole network."

81,@jeevanpillay
82,Shout out to @meemosworld for building a mental health NFT community 🤝🧠💪 https://t.co/VUCzjAo9UZ
83,NFTs not built around communities will bleed against Ethereum. Only communities can outpace the growth of another community (Ethereum). That’s why you shouldn’t buy into artist/creator NFTs expecting it to hold value in the long run. Treat it as an expense not an investment.
84,@cetxyz yo!
85,"@justinspratt @cdixon appeals to authority don’t work in web3, sorry"
86,The NFT space is in a very strange position where it has a strong emphasis on mental health yet purports to be the most amazing thing ever. Folks are struggling with the fact that NFTs have changed their life yet the constant attention has ruined their mental health.
87,Access to a credibly neutral decentralised financial system will soon be regarded as a human right.
88,"The NFT market is still in its infancy. As more liquidity enters the market, blue chips will attract the majority of the liquidity and volatility will decrease."
89,I am bullish on being bullish.

95,"The problem with capitalism isn't the existence of property, it's the fact that a small minority own most of the property. web3 solves this by giving everyone equal access to ownership of property."
96,"NFTs change the way fans support creators. Instead of simply donating to them, they receive ownership of the fan base which keeps its value. They also get to share in the upside as the fan base grows."
