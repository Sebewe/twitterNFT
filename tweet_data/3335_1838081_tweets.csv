40,"@BenjiSucher One interesting way I've heard NFTs be described is: a link between two nodes. In the case of art, it's a link between artist &amp; owner, similar to a like/follow on social media but more meaningful. There's now the ability to ascribe an explicit monetary value to that connection."

54,"When I look back a decade from now, it'll be in those connections where the most value will accrue. I couldn't agree more with this sentiment: https://t.co/NtdGvcXAN7."
55,"I've bought a lot of great NFTs this year but this one takes the cake as the most special. To me, an NFT represents much more than a JPEG or digital collectible. Beyond the item itself, it represents a connection I've made with the artist I'm buying from."
56,Toy Faces very thoughtfully captures the distinctiveness of each human and celebrates their diversity. Toy Rooms capture the essence of an environment and each room is full of fun little details. You can check out more of his work here: https://t.co/LRtfk1iBO4.
57,"I've been following @amritpaldesign for some time and he's just an incredible artist. His style is distinct, playful, and inviting and I fully admit to falling in love with his work (h/t @cmgs_). https://t.co/YaQiu80KMW"
