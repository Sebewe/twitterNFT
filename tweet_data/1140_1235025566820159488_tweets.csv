28,@RocinanteCPTL @RyanSAdams @cryptorayrays The ray rays are a vibe project and the back story is they are kind of an ode to the OG punks. So in a way a derivative. But this is a good derivative IMO because its not just a remake of punks. Its a new animal. its a vibe project so you cant expect much from it. But if do gravy
29,@RocinanteCPTL @RyanSAdams we love the rayrays @cryptorayrays
30,@CrakdCrypto They already have money so I find it hard to believe the cool cats needed funding and couldn't find another solution. I just dont feel like all the issues with cool pets right now are due to after launch hacks/exploits. I do think some of it could have been avoided with testing.
31,"@CrakdCrypto The other thing is if your art/tech/whatever isnt ready just delay your ""drop"". Like lets look at cool pets, I haven't been following super closely. But cool cats is supposed to be blue chip, if cool pets wasnt 100% ready before launch, why launch instead of delaying."
32,"@CrakdCrypto 100% with you. People who have never done something like this are not not-capable. But if we zoom out I'll bet more times than not someone with no experience is not going to deliver to the expectations that are set based on the amount of ""non-investment"" people are putting in."
33,@Vchow7777 @nftworldsNFT The coin or the land?
34,@CrakdCrypto Yeah its so wack. I am not going to virtue signal this view to everyone. But I am taking note and will be scrutinizing this aspect of projects more. 90% of the people running these projects right now have no right to be running multi-million dollar enterprises.
35,Im choosing violence this morning. Is there a valid reasons projects launch... collect their money....  and then make you wait like 2+ weeks to reveal and still have issues with their reveal? Here is a novel idea... dont grab the cash until you have figured out all your shit.
36,GM! Name a better feeling than waking up and seeing that someone bought you out of a project that you think is complete shit. Today is a good day. Finally out of 2 trash projects. GL to the buyers.

64,@Nachiszz @quadzillatd I think when it comes to HAPE and mekaverse the hate comes with the build up of hype that sends floors sky rocketing before reveal only to (of course) leave people disappointed. People spend ETH like it’s nothing and then realize oh that’s $40k what did I buy?

72,@alexjmingolla @SMarieJohn @NFTethics Do you? Because you were quick to defend the feelings that were posted today with little to no research from the “ethics” account. You want accountability but you want someone else to do the work. If someone wants to smear projects provide the paper trail of hard facts.
73,@ChiantiTrail @NFTethics If you can’t show me a paper trail of your work I don’t need to listen to your nft ethics voice.
74,@alexjmingolla @NFTethics 😂 what a shit take
75,@RobertLoughlin1 Im 100% with you. They seem like they need to go take an ethics class. It’s just so funny to me that people only look hard for a scam or controversy as something is minting or after it’s minted. This call out by NFT ethics shows how this person/group deserves no respect.
76,@oglvnae That account is feeding you false information. So be careful.
77,@crispylines Ahhh shit I was about to say where’s the blunt. I shoulda known better. Patience pays
78,@imfastkid @_SillieBear @NFTethics They just heard about it. Believe them
