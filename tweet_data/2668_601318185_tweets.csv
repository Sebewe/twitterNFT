0,"The combination of provable on-chain randomness using ChainLink + a backend computing the metadata on the fly is great at preventing:
🛡️reveal being gamed by bots
🛡️team gaming the randomness

This technique should be used more often in NFT drops.

Kudos @evankeast , @poopie 💯"
1,"SpaceDoodle holders have the ability to ""dock"", essentially unwrapping their token and get back their original @doodles .

The concept is quite simple:
Wrap: deposit @doodles into the SpaceDoodle contract and mint a Space Doodle
Unwrap: deposit Space Doodle and retrieve @doodles"
2,"Once all trait values have been defined, the contract will emit an event, so that the backend service can properly generate the metadata and upload the image on ipfs.

It seems that the random assignment of the Spaceship itself isn't relying on ChainLink VRF..maybe..sequential?"
3,"Each trait has a value from 1-8:
- 1/256 chance to get an 8
- 2/256 chance to get a 7
- 4/256 chance to get a 6

Those values are written directly in the SpaceDoodle smart contract, which indicates that they will be used later on by other contracts. https://t.co/PVbsS9yKbE"
4,"The first time a @doodles is deposited, a spaceship with 5 traits (piloting, mechanical, stamina, bladder, vibe) is randomly generated.

SpaceDoodle contract is using ChainLink VRF to compute a random 256 bit word per Spaceship, which will then be used to roll the dice per trait."
5,"Context: Existing @doodles holders can finally deposit their token and create a spaceship in order to launch to space.

Space Doodle is a brand new NFT collection - in order to get a Space Doodle, one must deposit their @doodles into the SpaceDoodles contract. https://t.co/YNQ4FebxbV"

53,⚠️ The team can mint an unlimited supply of NFT. https://t.co/Jfi6GfjpHk
54,"7/ TL;DR:
- Team anon with fresh new wallets: they did not leave much trace behind
- Mint of 800 ETH coming from a single account: unsure if inflating numbers or just a failed NFT sniping operation
- Promo/Collab between @squiggles and @StonerApeClub - likely just a victim?"
55,"6/ All Rinkeby accounts used to test the Squiggles contract are also fresh new wallets that receive 0.1 ETH from a faucet that does NOT require social media link verification.

The @squiggles team hasn't withdrawn their $ETH yet with 2500 $ETH sitting in the contract"
56,"5/ All operator accounts are all fresh new wallets (less than a day) funded by a Binance account (same exchange as the 800 ETH account).

Except the 0x25d (@AlexxSAC), 0x030 (@StonerApeClub) - see screenshot for their side of the story https://t.co/wA0zs4BUA7"
57,4/ Another bot scooped 60 ETH worth of @squiggles (detectable because of the exact same gas price). Although those accounts have a pattern that looks like real bots with previous snipe on the following projects @ThePixelmon (RIP) or @killergfnft. https://t.co/tTfrk0OKFF
58,"3/ Mint numbers were inflated with over 800 ETH coming out of a single account distributed across 160 distinct brand new wallets.

Each accounts then sold the Squiggles at a big loss -60% https://t.co/8rI7XP52uF"
59,"2/ First, the obvious: if you see a combination of the points below, it usually smells fishy:
☑️ Team fully anon
☑️ Twitter created recently with big followers
☑️ Discord created recently with big followers"
60,"1/ Context:
@squiggles, a 10K collection launched less than 24hours ago its Auction mint (1 ETH).

76,"5/ Coming back to the Vanity Block, this mint is purposely trying to capture in a NFT the first NFT that consumes 100% of the available space.

A single block with a single transaction 🤯."
77,"4/ Less nodes == Higher centralization.

Ultimately, that's what the likes of BSC and other L1s are doing. They are able to offer higher throughput by increasing the requirements to run a validator node, and therefore increasing block limits :)"
78,"3/ This limitation is what is currently causing high gas cost on Ethereum as there are more demands (more transactions) than available space in each block.

So why not increase the limit? Increasing the limit is bad for decentralization as it requires higher specs to run a node."
79,"2/ Ethereum transactions are executed when a chosen miner include them in a block.

A new block is mined roughly every 13 seconds.
A block capacity is currently limited to 30M, arbitrary limitation defined by the Ethereum core team."
80,"For Normies #1:

A few days ago, a Vanity Blocks NFT was minted using 30M of gas (3.42 ETH in fee).

This is *likely* the highest gas consumed by a single transaction that has occurred since Ethereum genesis.
