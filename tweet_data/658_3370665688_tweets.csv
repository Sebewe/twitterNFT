2,@SirVincentFred @Pixelmon @RemindMe_OfThis I hope not. We have definitely seen a big short term change but I do fear in 6 months time the lesson get forgotten or new entrants don't take the time to learn the lessons of the past

13,@Samotorski @CryptoDickbutts Bullish
14,"@JeremyStreete14 @superfatapes @BoredApeYC has more IG 3D project with potentially high mint price vibes than i'd like, but their genesis collection has a high floor and seems a bit more memey so worth monitoring"
15,"Don't under-estimate the power of meme NFTs. Most holders are OGs who don't panic/quick flip.

Examples:
CrypToadz → 2.49 Eth floor
CryptoDickButts → 1.369 Eth floor
Mfers → 3.15 Eth floor

Guess what? None have a roadmap.

Guess what? None had ridiculous mint prices."
16,"@Cryptographiser @ChefDizzyD I track two of Gary's, although I am sure he has more. 0x5ea9681c3ab9b5739810f8b91ae65ec47de62119 and 0xd6a984153acb6c9e2d788f08c2465a1358bb89a7

I use @ninjalerts to track. Gives you notifications right to your mobile. Nice and simple to use."
17,@Cryptographiser @ChefDizzyD something like that 🤣
18,"The speed you attain information is key. When big influencers like Gary Vee buy something, there is often a pump directly after (not always). If you buy the second after they do, you can often ride the wave. 

But if you get your information too slow, you might be exit liquidity. https://t.co/4kEfIIA8LU"
19,@arcadedotinc Interesting...
20,"Want some NFT alpha? Sometimes the best thing to do is to do nothing at all. Just watch the market instead. Don't feel like you always have to be jumping into the next project, otherwise you'll end up minting out of FOMO and that's how you make bad decisions."

34,@garyvee That reporter is the epitome of where ignorance meets ego.
35,@M_Paciotti Yeah but S2 came after S1 and the ecosystem was already built. S2 were worth like an 8 Eth floor as soon as you got it. So that's fair IMO.
36,"Quick reminder: Ether Orcs, Neo Tokyo S1, Cool Cats, Anonymice, CryptoPunks, Cryptoadz &amp; DeadFellaz were all either free mints or under 0.07 eth.

Back then, we'd have laughed in their face if they'd tried to charge 0.25 Eth per NFT (which seems to be the norm right now)."

44,"Tracking wallets is a very big brain thing to do. But if you are apeing in after someone you track has minted, make sure they actually minted.

Scammers continuously dev mint to other's wallets to trick you.

To check, go to Etherscan and check who interacted with the contract. https://t.co/Xz1cjAqk6N"

60,"3D NFT Project Dev Checklist:

✔️ Get rig of random animal
✔️ Set price at 0.25 Eth
✔️ Add 10% royalty
✔️ Oversubscribe raffle
✔️ Launch WL but accidentally open to public
✔️ Do nothing &amp; slowly disappear with everyone's Eth

There are exceptions but we see this play almost daily"
61,@crypto_titi @thingdoms 100% they have a lot of room to grow 🚀 So early for the thingies
62,"I said this on August 5th when BAYC was at 14 eth floor. 

The truth is, just about any of the top projects were still cheap back then - Cool Cats, Doodles, WOW, Deadfellaz etc.

There are a new batch that we'll be saying this about in 6 months time too. https://t.co/DTtOgILV7C"

68,"The current market is very interesting. Crypto has crashed harshly, yet NFTs are still seeing decent volume. Generally when the market is fearful, activity slows down hard -but it's happening much less this time.

👉 NFT sentiment is becoming less tied to crypto markets."

70,"You only have enough Eth for one, which NFT are you buying? 

Azuki (@AzukiZen) 
or 
Hape Beast (@HAPEBEASTGANG)?"
71,@SirVincentFred So true and launching new projects every week
72,"@Cryptotrissy Them too 😆 The real winners were the ones who scooped cheap world of women, cool cats etc."
73,"We have some big projects coming up that will shift liquidity around e.g. Hapebeast, Coolpets, Invisible Friends.

You'll see people dumping NFTs for Eth to buy these projects. So, consider watching out to snipe some deals. We saw this happen many times before e.g. MAYC,  Clone X"

82,"@jmt_nft ahh i never got into these, will take another look"
83,@Quest3300 i'm deep in 💙
84,@necrotic1979 Mainly undervalued in the current market. Long term works but then the longer you hold the more you need to factor in the opportunity cost of locking up Eth when judging if they are undervalued or not.
85,"Hunting for an undervalued NFT floor to sweep... last time I asked this, you shared some real gems including Wavelengths which went from 0.5 eth to 2 eth+.

So let's go again! Drop them in the comments..."
