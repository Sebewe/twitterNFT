18,@staringispolite @grelysian @WGMInterfaces really good and i hope it gives other artists some confidence if they need to step back from all this
19,@WGMInterfaces love y'all and fully support this

22,"@iamnomon i haven't really, i just think it brings up a lot of worthwhile questions. here's another couple: obviously this sucks for the artist, but what can you do if you licensed away your IP rights before the advent of NFTs? would they feel similarly if this had been a traditional game?"

32,@joeyroth this is art
33,"@viniciusmanriq it's one of my favorites, from this book (not an nft (yet))

34,"@sadaf_eth definitely doesn't look good, but it's also not crazy to put your $70 million treasury into something other than cash, especially if you believe in the longevity of nfts. just extremely risky / poor judgement"
35,"@matto__matto exactly. to me there's nothing wrong with using premade assets, especially if it's an effort to keep prices low, but only if it's transparent. passing them off as original art and charging 3 eth would be deception"
36,"@mmatyus yeah i dunno. really my only point is that ""rugged"" doesn't capture the nuance of the situation"
37,@shiraeis traffic is traffic
38,"@sadaf_eth it's going to be next to impossible to deliver that kind of value, they should refund and scale back"
39,"@mmatyus he called it unacceptable and vowed to do better. whether or not we believe that, he hasn't disappeared"
40,@thefaketomato yes lol. precedents are useful
41,@CarlHPetersonIV i'll never understand what ddosing' the enemy's PR web site for a few hours is supposed to accomplish
42,"hard to think of a game application for nfts that requires charging anything more than next to nothing, especially if you believe in the scale you're capable of"
43,"just to wrap this up and be clear: taking 3 eth for these is not okay and i side completely with the buyers, who should be refunded. if the project's creator is acting in good faith they need to demonstrate it now. fudging the line between art and game asset is bad enough"
44,"@0xmts could be. i think intent matters a lot and it's honestly hard for me to read. either way if i were a buyer i'd be pissed, i'm certainly not excusing the poor execution for 3 eth. this was bound to go poorly"
45,@MeCryptoCookie this
46,@ElfoCrypto your entire feed and identity is shill posts but ok
47,@ElfoCrypto lol happy to give you a full refund
48,@ElfoCrypto you really rugged me with this reply
49,"don't get me wrong, i'm not defending this; if pixelmon were promising original characters and they just bought the assets, then that's a scam. and of course buyers want their game characters to look good on opensea if that's the only thing you can do with them right now"
50,"were the buyers expecting art, or were they expecting an arrangement of voxels that can be rendered in an infinite number of ways and whose primary value is their interactivity within a game space?"
51,"what i'm seeing is incredibly poor execution, not a rug pull. i'm also seeing nft-based games being held to the standard of art, which they frankly shouldn't. lots of games use unity assets (seems like these were licensed properly, or that was the intent)
https://t.co/M9bcw2Vb56"
52,"my primary takeaway from the pixelmon fiasco is that we need words other than ""rugged"" to describe what happens when an nft project disappoints https://t.co/NPYkPe1p3B"

67,"this might be a fun thing for @analogue to consider for the pocket some day, an unusually good but still affordable DAC and mini audio player. could be cool for nanoloop musicians, too"
68,also one of the launch models (SCPH-1001) apparently had a fantastic digital to analog converter and they were coveted for a while by non-game playing audiophiles
69,this was such a great aspect of the early optical disc console era. many PS1 games let you swap in a standard audio CD once the assets were loaded https://t.co/EsD3f9gTTv
