33,"Note: there aren't many of things that project founders can do to incentivize a lower the floor price early, but not creating unjustified hype is definitely one of them. Structuring the mint to in a way that achieves better price discovery is another one."
34,"I believe that lowering the early price entry point to make the community more accessible, diverse and incentivized to grow the value of the ecosystem as a whole is critical to any NFT project."
35,The community is also the best source of scalable efforts. Building a sustainable ecosystem requires empowering every community member to contribute to the project in their own way.
36,"Great products take time to build, regardless of the funding. Great communities also take time to build, and *A LOT* more if the financial entry bar is very high without justification."
37,"If the entry price point is extremely high, financial upside is naturally reduced. To balance this, one may seek value in community/tech/art. And if the project is very early, it's more than likely than tech or community are not there yet."
38,"These days, just like in 2017/18 for fungible tokens, the emphasis on the financial value derived from upside of flipping is extremely high, even eclipsing other sources of value almost entirely."
39,"In order for ecosystems to grow and thrive, it's critical for people to see value in them over time. In NFT projects, value can be derived from anything: financial, social, artistic, entertainment, you name it."
40,"I view NFT projects as ecosystems. This includes a top-level community, sub-communities, individual contributors (art, engineering, design, product, marketing), evangelists, and more."
41,Why a very early high floor for NFT projects is bad in my opinion as I received the question multiple times 🧵⤵️

43,"@AJ211103 @CH_101010 I think that if this ends up being a great solution, sure! We'll see"
44,@CH_101010 Keeping the floor price low is great early on to ensure that more people can get access at a relatively more affordable price. The idea is to build a community with an entry point that people can reasonably buy at. There's no perfect solution but this one's great

46,"@CH_101010 3. WL'd folks will have an incentive to put a lower floor price in the first place to snatch more in the public DA at a lower price.

Those are the big reasons of why I'm bullish on this system."
47,"@CH_101010 2. Because the price will decrease below OS floor price at some point, this will motivate early sellers/flippers to re-list on OS at a lower price. Sellers now have to compete with decreasing price, bringing the floor lower and lower for longer."
48,"@CH_101010 I think this formula is great for 3 reasons:
1. Starting above OS floor price shuts down the big ""hyper-FOMO"" rush that gets people to buy at the highest price point. It gets people to actually wait for the right price.. 🧵"

89,@sriramk @punk6529 @donnie @alive_eth @eddylazzarin One example could be to periodically review the outstanding approvals/allowances and allow users to revoke them based on their needs.
90,"@sriramk @punk6529 @donnie @alive_eth @eddylazzarin As important as standardizing permissions which requires work across service and wallet providers, wallet provider must also work on presenting and managing them overtime in a way that is secure-by-default, human-readable and frictionless for the end-user."
