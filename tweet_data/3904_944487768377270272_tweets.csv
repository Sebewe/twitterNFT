1,"@DrMilburn @funky_flies Sorry I missed those conversations. I don't visit discord but to check announcements and who has time to listen to every space for project updates? Again, first time I'm hearing about mutation limits."
2,"@funky_flies @DrMilburn Who said anything about unlimited? I would think that if everyone gets a chance at mutation, that would include those holding 1, 2, and 3 flys and not have to hold a minimum of 4 flies to get 2 drops. Looking at GACC, where one guy held 5 apes and got 5 serums dropped to him. IDK"
