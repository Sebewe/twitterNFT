26,"@brett_eth @nakouzi_tommy Nice. This was mine, project and artwork had so much potential. https://t.co/WmxbGjNkW8"
27,"@brett_eth @nakouzi_tommy Bought one for 0.5 as my first nft, sold that shit last week for 0.2. Lost all faith is devs and just accepted my loss."
28,@nakouzi_tommy @brett_eth Sucks because I really liked the artwork.
29,"@nakouzi_tommy @brett_eth No, the devs running it seem to just be money grabbing"
30,"@brett_eth Ape kids club, I really liked the artwork so I bought one, then the team dropped a derivative project (ape kids football club) and charged 0.16 eth to mint them (around half the price of the main project)."

44,RT @Banks: “NFT” is synonymous with “Fortnite Skin” or @ and .com ownership. Still confused as to why so many people THINK they hate NFT’s…

46,@peterlevin I can’t think of a better alternative currently besides putting a warning similar to the warning given for suspicious activity. However further down the road I’d like to see a more decentralized approach to this issue. 2/2
47,"@peterlevin I obviously don’t want unsuspecting people to buy them, but I don’t think taking the project down is the right approach. There are an infinite amount of rugs and fake projects and combatting them by taking them down is ineffective in the grand scheme. 1/2"
48,"Why did squiggles get removed from opensea? I know they’re a rug, but taking a project down doesn’t feel like web3"
49,"RT @jpegplug: 60 page document as to why squiggles is a rug:
