23,@Minhofnbr It's not a collab. There is no benefit to Meta Joseon holders. Its called a rug.
24,"@Meta_Survivors Meta Joseon is a rug, why would you team with them? They already moved onto a different project. LMAO"
25,@CryptoB612 @Meta_Joseon Turns out only 90 people got full body renders. They sold the NFT with videos of fashion walks and different outfits and only 90 people got full body renders of their NFT's. That is a scam. There is no fashion utility and there is no metaverse functionality. Just a scam.
26,@LinusCaldwell5 @punk6333 Clones and CryptoonGoonz have been my comfy places lately in this turbulent time of ipad art spam. I think in any parabolic growth there will always be bad actors.
