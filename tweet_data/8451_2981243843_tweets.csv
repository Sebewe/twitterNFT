81,"There is a lot to do in order to onboard the world into crypto, Ethereum took the first step by creating a secure and decentralized smart-contract blockchain… this is the second step in the right direction."
82,I hope users will be able to use projects deployed on Starknet mainchain/validiums or zkSync 2.0/zkPorter without noticing any change in gas fees because the only thing keeping them apart is a bridge between this solutions. https://t.co/HQbcmjlVX3
83,"Losing details about what ice cream flavour you bought? No problem.
Losing or getting 32 ETH freezed because a malicius actor or what ever screwd up the off-chain data? That's a big no no."
84,Now what about receiving your paycheck? Making some degen trading? Staking ETH? That's 100% what you want to get stored on-chain just in case something wrong happens off-chain and you need to access that data.
85,"Why would anyone want to choose validium mode you might ask?
Think of it this way, you don't want to spend 20 cents on a tx for an ice cream worth 2 dollars, you'd want the tx to be free or at most a couple of cents. Who cares if you buying an ice cream is stored on-chain?"
86,"What I'd like to see in the future is full compatibility between zkRollups like zkSync and StarkNet where transaction cost will be extremely low, especially in validium setups (called zkPorter by Matter Labs) where data is not stored on the Ethereum mainchain. https://t.co/mAWeWqxvjg"
87,"Currently Ethereum protocols/smart-contracts/projects (DeFi, NFTs marketplaces, DEXs, Bridges, etc.) are fragmented between L1, L2s and Sidechains (most notably Polygon PoS). https://t.co/FGZfzAHFpE"
88,"By the time retail users start pouring into L2s I expect solutions like zkSync 2.0 (with their zkEVM) and Starknet (with Warp, their Solidity-Cairo transpiler) to kick in and finally enable small users to interact with Ethereum"
89,"Even though they aren't able to get transaction costs below $1 they are still been optimized and they also benefit from full EVM compatibility.

It means that anything currently live on Ethereum mainnet can be ""copy-pasted"" into Arbitrum or Optimism with very minor changes."
90,"If your average smart-contract interaction most days costs anywhere from $50 to $150 in gas fees then it's unpractical to use for a lot of people.

We need something to solve this issue now and that's where ORs come in. https://t.co/KydiRFWDS1"
91,"First of all, Optimistic or ZK?

In my humble opinion Optimistic Rollups (OR) are a necessary, but temporal, step towards full blown scalability on Ethereum."
92,"I just published The future on L2s!

This is what I hope zkRollups grow to be, where users don't need to think of which protocol/rollup they need to use in order to get the best deal, they simply get the crème de la crème in every case.
