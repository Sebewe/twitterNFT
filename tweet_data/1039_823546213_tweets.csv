These guys are killing it and showcasing the potential of IBC and Cosmos SDK ⚛️"
9,"Recently we saw @AaveAave supporting staked ETH from @LidoFinance as collateral

But… Osmosis Superfuild Staking is way more impressive IMO

Imagine you pool ETH and DAI on Uniswap and you can use the pooled ETH to stake on Lido

It’s basically reversed Liquid staking 🤯"

19,"@GNSPS @Corpetty It’s the equivalent to the funding of startups pre-revenue vs post-revenue

Startups pre-revenue tend to raise more capital than post-revenue ones"
20,"@GNSPS @Corpetty Actually I would say pro bono is the best way to not sell yourself short

There is a huge difference between getting paid 10 for an hour of your time and doing it pro bono

Plus one could reach a point where its hour is worth 1000 after many years of pro bono"
21,"@abbey_titcomb @AFDudley0 I think we can’t describe it without context

But let’s consider blockchain… transaction value must be higher than transaction cost

Whether it goes through the mempool or flashbots… as long the cost is smaller than its value then it’s viable"
22,@alek7239 @gavofyork @Ukraine Do you really think a major co-founder of Ethereum prior to its ICO does not have enough ETH to donate???
23,"@abbey_titcomb @AFDudley0 As long as there is always a viable way to achieve the same result

The trick here is the word “viable”"
24,@crypto_bobby @ASvanevik Only if it saves Justin from going to prison
25,"@gavofyork @Ukraine people responding to those criticizing this tweet because he is “donating” 5M

It’s not a donation if it has conditions

It’s a product placement leveraging major global conflict with a 5M price tag

I’m sorry but he should just convert to ETH if he really want to donate"
26,@mikedemarais This thread is my favorite take so far https://t.co/fxDlTYNtH3
27,"@foldfinance @petejkim @0xngmi @bertcmiller @henlojseam @danfinlay Or we could all support EIP-3074 to allow transactions to be called by EOA with a signed message (aka meta-tx)

https://t.co/gJGDssM18u"
28,"@0xngmi @foldfinance @bertcmiller @henlojseam @petejkim @danfinlay The path forward is to: 
a) deprecate eth_sign completely
b) adopt eth_signTransaction
c) target requests with a chainId

This will remove the friction to multi-chain and improved transaction UX

I will do my best to push this for WalletConnect and incentivize MetaMask to follow"
29,@JHancock @LefterisJP @peter_szilagyi @bantg @element_hq one message 100k gas 🤣
30,@LefterisJP @peter_szilagyi @bantg @element_hq From my understanding each account is associated with  one server so participants on a particular chat need to register through different servers to decentralize
31,"@LefterisJP @peter_szilagyi @bantg @element_hq That's correct but it doesn't necessarily mean that is caching all messages

Popular chats are more likely to survive since more participants/accounts means more servers will cache those messages

Less popular chats are more likely to be censored so they should run their own"
32,"@LefterisJP @peter_szilagyi @bantg @element_hq Any messaging protocol would rely on an archive system to cache messages while users are offline

So unless the user is observing all messages and caching them… then yes"

34,"@wassielawyer @oguizaria @Timccopeland 100% far from perfect… you could even say barely any DAO is worth the D in its name

Yet we at least have some public channels to observe discourse for these orgs

ICOs on the other hand were basically just announcements tweets

Definitely not good times for Ethereum back then"
35,"@wassielawyer @oguizaria @Timccopeland DAOs are far from perfect and maybe there are only a few good ones

But ICOs were so much worse that I think it isn’t reasonable to compare"
36,"@wassielawyer @oguizaria @Timccopeland I think we look back at ICOs in 2017… we see zero responsibility or accountability to anything

DAOs may under-deliver in many cases but we are talking about disappointing results from an on-chain orgs that can be monitored

ICOs were opaque orgs taking money and going quiet"

64,"@milessuter @basche42 Let’s not forget that this will also mark the beginning of a world war and use of cryptocurrency will be tainted as support for Russia

68,"@iamdecentral @0xTRIES It definitely has and WalletConnect is essentially a more specialized version of DIDComm

v2.0 makes it a little bit more generalized but still a few iterations to get as generalized as DIDComm

Who knows! Maybe WalletConnect v3.0 will be fully DIDComm compatible"
