8,@1202reklaW Make sure to revoke access to opensea! It might be signature phishing too.

18,@S2TE_CRYPTO @davidbroom1983 @ryanallis NFTs are like Trojan horses to hold ethereum 😆
19,"@S2TE_CRYPTO @davidbroom1983 @ryanallis Does it consider the fact that NFTs lock ethereum as well? The ones who have NFTs are kind of building huge ethereum wallets where ethereum is kind of hodled.

So technically, ethereum staking + NFT triggered stacking is how I see it. Very bullish on Eth!"
20,@punk9059 My personal conclusion was yes it was signature phishing.
21,@punk9059 We talked in depth here if you are interested. https://t.co/yWgIGONFRK

May be start with other projects and then bring in big boys."
35,Holyshit @grayboysdao almost at 2 Eth!
36,@BoradApe Family missed Borad. Borad need more active.
37,@afearfuljesuit @Rewkang @MechanismCap @nftworldsNFT @fahdananta you should probably get some @nftworldsNFT
38,@treasuresETH @undacappn @Nate_Rivers @mart1ndoteth Ok this is actually scary. One signature to validate multiple transactions. This attack in that scenario is just getting started. People can easily farm signatures via mints and leverage them to drain wallets.
39,"@undacappn @Nate_Rivers @treasuresETH @mart1ndoteth Thanks for the analogy. According to your analogy @Nate_Rivers would have signed 10 times on a phished link for 10 NFTs he owns? Not sure how many NFTs he lost, but there should be 1-1 mapping of NFT to signature spoofing according to the logic mentioned here."
40,@treasuresETH @mart1ndoteth From same victim* 10 signatures of same victim for 10 stolen NFTs.
41,"@treasuresETH @mart1ndoteth Coming back to this. If each listing requires a signature, then for every NFT that was stolen (from same victim) there should be a corresponding signature to farm by the attacker right? Thus if 10 NFTs are stolen attacker should have 10 signatures right?"
42,@NadavAHollander What is the purpose of a signature if someone can replicate it? Ideally no one should be able to relay a signature right?
43,"@undacappn @Nate_Rivers @treasuresETH @mart1ndoteth Yes, the thing which confuses me the most is what is the purpose of signature if someone can relay the signature? It beats the purpose of having signature! Thus I am still not convinced that this was just a phishing and not a bug in the contract."
44,"RT @JackRhysider: The brakes on a car are only there to enable us to go faster. 

The security team should should be looked at the same way…"
45,"@Nate_Rivers @treasuresETH @mart1ndoteth The NFTs that were lost, do you know if you listed the collection before? Also, the ones which were not stolen did Opensea have access to it?"
46,"@treasuresETH @mart1ndoteth You are right with regards to signature. One has to sign for every NFT. But, the individual still mentioned this a month ago - ""There is a bug in the WyvernTokenTransferProxy approval that allows anyone to transfer NFTs to other wallets"" may be this doesn't need a signature?"
47,"@treasuresETH @mart1ndoteth No, if you list it once and gave access to Opensea then you don't need to list other NFTs. That's why you pay for transaction only once and not every time to list a NFT from same collection."
48,@treasuresETH @mart1ndoteth So it’s possible you legitimately gave access to Opensea to do a transaction i.e. sell a NFT and you signed it with your keys because this is by function.
49,"@treasuresETH @mart1ndoteth Obviously it requires a signature by the owner. When you list a NFT via opensea, you authorize opensea rights to sell or transfer. If the bug is in the contract and if you didn’t revoke the access, opensea still has access to your NFT and the specific collection."
50,@treasuresETH @mart1ndoteth What proves it was a phishing attack and not a bug which was exploited?

54,@quantwhale This 💯
55,Holy sh!t! This is it. https://t.co/TpNo8tgwJH
56,"@dearearth_ @mutantcats DAO is another one. It’s not utility project per say, but they do have almost 2300 Eth worth NFTs in their DAO so lot of liquidity to buy good projects.

Example in attached screenshot, you may look at their discord for more purchases they have. https://t.co/zOCzd2kdS6"
57,"@G_Gallows @lifestylearb @CyphrETH In that scenario, if the e-mail origin is compromised that means somewhere network is compromised and the email server/service provider along with it."
58,"@G_Gallows @lifestylearb @CyphrETH Spoofing email is not difficult, but I checked the email I got and that is definitely not spoofed. I checked the “show original” part of email and it looks legitimate.  It had DMARC, SPF

Not sure though what phished email the individual users who were compromised got."
59,@dearearth_ @nftworldsNFT is the kind of NFT project you should look at.
60,@ElectionDayMad1 Just make sure another wallet has no access to opensea. Double check by checking on https://t.co/0EZS7liCge or etherscan token approvals.
61,@adrianhetman @dguido https://t.co/EiEw3TL5Df
62,"If https://t.co/0EZS7liCge is not working for you. 
On etherscan there’s an options to connect your wallet under “More” -&gt; “Token approvals (beta)” -&gt; “ERC-721” -&gt; Connect to wallet -&gt; Click on By Contract -&gt; Revoke access."
63,@89Justintime I don’t think this is a phishing issue. Almost all opensea emails has a UUID like the one in your screenshot.
64,"@lifestylearb @CyphrETH The email came from opensea email Id. 

If this is actually a phishing email that means opensea network is compromised and someone leveraged opensea’s email to send emails to the end user."

75,"@theycallmeshwaz @ABigThingBadly @0xApes_NFT Do you measure intelligence with the type of NFT one buys? Interesting 😂
