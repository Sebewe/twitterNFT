13,@NakedSn4ke64 Tough one today.
14,Poll: Has the explosion of mfer derivatives diluted the demand for the OG mfers?
15,"@sartoshi_nft @PhariseesHouse @pinedegen @same_mfers It doesn't look good. Lots of people were fooled in a thread I was in earlier. CC0 appears to allow it, but it's morally dubious. In particular the Same Mfers is made to look as if it's you."
16,"@monstera_sc Unfortunately, you may be right. Legally permissible, but morally dubious."

20,@izildurrr Then again....maybe another couple of mferbots.
21,@izildurrr Nothing much planned for this week. It would be nice to see some volume return to the market though.
22,"@pinedegen I've had a couple of SCTs in the past, but I'm scope-less these days. I never managed to get a shot of M51 as good as that though. Super job 👏"
23,@pinedegen And this was the first NFT I sold last April. I do wonder whether it was the first astro photo sold as an NFT. https://t.co/x4sVAYFqLH
24,"@athiarchist No, but I have whaled into some polygon projects that I absolutely love, but that no-one is likely to see."
25,"@pinedegen mfer! Here's one I took a few years ago. This was through a 4"" apo. What are you using? https://t.co/yEy3HjH88N"
26,@r3cubeyou Resistance isn’t the issue for me. If I had the cash I’d get #2
27,@monstera_sc The fact that a bunch of mfers have replied thinking these are OG mfers is a clear indication of why these copies need to be removed.

29,"@bagstacker69 I think derivatives offer the basis for creativity, but just copying like that is out of order."
30,@FFMfers @sartoshi_nft Fair enough. It's hard for a mfer to keep track of mfers.
31,@mfer_kids @sartoshi_nft Plenty of room. All welcome.

53,"@pinedegen @azukimfers Very disappointed about the way they are being released. If you haven't finished the artwork, don't start the mint. Mfers and derivatives have been united in avoiding this approach so far."

62,"@GuyImprov I'm not sure I could single out a factor. Longevity is good, but only if it's historical or the team is still fully engaged. I look out for red flags, and the biggest is if the art is not yet revealed."
63,@DrifterShoots Love it. 😂
64,@petevantoad There are a few of us. I discovered one last week who was a year older than me. I thought sure I'd be the eldest.

83,Buckle up mfers. We're off again.🚀
84,@FastFoodMfers @MasterChanX So are you abandoning v1.0 in favor of version 2.0? Will the free mint offer the same degree of rarity as V1.0?

90,@jsgo70 @sartoshi_nft I think the two major pumps we've had the last two Sundays have just been too big. It draws the attention of speculators and trading bots. A stealthy rise is what I'd like to see.
