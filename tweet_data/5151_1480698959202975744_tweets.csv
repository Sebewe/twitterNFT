83,@AtownBrown @xtremetom Keep a store of who minted the project in the first place. That way you can restrict double minting 😊😊
84,@AtownBrown @xtremetom The non-fun way to do it could be to just take a snapshot and load the addresses to determine eligibility
85,@AtownBrown @xtremetom Hmmmm this is interesting. Couldn't you just check to see if person X's wallet contained that specific land/property in order to mint? Haven't tried it with 1155 yet but been thinking about a proj that does something similar.
