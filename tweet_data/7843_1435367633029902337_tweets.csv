21,"@europe_mph @MaroonDawg_ @unusual_whales Some of the worst mistakes in US history have been a result of EO… interment camps, Vietnam, everything Cheney ever did. This looks to be on trend with that claim. How bout regulating the inherently corrupt stock market first…."
22,"@europe_mph @MaroonDawg_ @unusual_whales Technically, EO are open to interpretation as the “executive power” clause in S1A2 is quite ambiguous. However, EOs in general can be seen as unconstitutional regardless of partisanship as it completely negates the separation of powers clause in the same section."
