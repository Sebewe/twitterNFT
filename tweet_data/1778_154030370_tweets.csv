76,@ApeCollector Legendary 🙏
77,"@ApeCollector Yes, but when clicking the image I am suggesting it opens up to the collection floor vs. just the cheapest item. Seeing how much less the floor item is vs. the next is interesting (to me), especially with M2’s so ppl don’t have to manually sort by bg to see the collection floor."
78,"@ApeCollector Instead of going to the specific item on the floor, can you go to the collection floor? For example, can you go to the M2 floor vs. the cheapest M2?"
