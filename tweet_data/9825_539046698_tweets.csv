76,"@Solchemist @TheOnlyNom I don’t disagree. I think we could do a post 1st vote debrief for the DAO once this is all over for next ones. I didn’t mean to pick a fight, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned in last couple weeks-there’s a counterpoint for every point when 2500 holders. Can’t please everyone"
77,"@Solchemist @TheOnlyNom Then I think you missed my point…have you read the threads today?  Something that’s obvious to you isn’t obvious to a bunch of others…I personally don’t see a benefit to anonymous voting when everyone loudly announces their choice before, during, and after their vote."
78,@Solchemist @TheOnlyNom Good point but do you format votes for how the world is or how it should be?  It should be everyone wants to arrive at an honest result.  If we format for reality…how far down the rabbit hole is sufficient…anonymous? Discussion limitations? Leadership silence? 3rd party ref’s?
79,@Solchemist @TheOnlyNom hate to hear when people say they didn’t/almost didn’t cast a vote because they think it is wasted on the losing side…in this particular case…there are ample uncast votes that could swing the issue the other way…The wisest policy is no games…everyone vote their conscience…
