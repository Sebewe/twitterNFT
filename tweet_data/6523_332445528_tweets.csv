The key comes down to your price point.  If your price point is not high enough, you won't make it pay.

Never made it work w/out: 

(a) a sales team calling the leads, &amp; 
(b) sales team really good at selling annuals."

But supply chain has been an issue too."

25,8. A business is more likely to get on the right path when resources are limited and you are forced to listen to your customer and give them what they truly need.  This doesn't happen when growth money is sloshing around.

28,"3. You can be profitable in your first month, and every month thereafter, if you want to be.
