1,@jchervinsky Who is saying this?
2,@boredgentleman @KingBlackBored Best series. F*@&amp; society!
3,"@boredgentleman Couldn’t agree more. We don’t collectively stand up for each other and for what’s right. Greed runs rampant, corruption goes unpunished, and the kind and generous are often unappreciated taken advantage. Society needs to wake the fuck up."
4,@iwwon_official Amen fren. Politicians (and politics) are the worst (for the most part). We need politicians who truly care about the least among us. So sad 💔
5,"Excellent point. I have visited Russia, and its people are kind, peaceful, and largely not supportive of this type of tyranny, from my experience. A nation is its people, not its political leaders. https://t.co/RVlCTqVkbK"
6,"@ShaneCultra Russia wants to expand its empire and claim a key geographic on the border between europe and Russia. Don’t think Russia will stop at Ukraine. If not pushed back, they’ll go for Lithuania, Estonia, etc. Putin wants the return of the old Soviet Union"
7,"Gm, sending love, prayers, good vibes, to Ukraine and everyone with loved ones there. Such a sad and frightening moment, unreal. 💙💛🙏 ✨ 🇺🇦🇺🇦"
8,"@SantiagoVelez95 @camilacampton If you’re in Medellín, please DM me. Would love to connect with more bitcoiners/crytpo-native gente down here."
9,@camilacampton I’ve been here in Colombia for the past 3-4 months doing exactly that. 🇨🇴 🚀
10,"@_miketriumph_ @NizzyNFT I like x2y2’s UI, very smooth and easy to use, you can list multiple items at once. Def should check it out and claim/stake if you have a non-trivial amount available to claim"
11,@Bornosor I don’t have a house ser. Sold it to buy ape jpegs.
12,@Bornosor Loveeee the art 😍 🔥
13,"@Blockassetco If I could invest in one rising star athlete, it would be @LuisFDiaz19 . He’s young, hungry, comes from very humble beginnings, and is incredibly talented. Has a bright future with Liverpool and Colombia 🇨🇴🇨🇴"
14,"RT @Blockassetco: Web3 allows for a new level of ownership. Introducing Blockasset athlete tokenisation 🪙

Spot upcoming talent, invest ear…"
15,"@desiraecherie Lol, precisely 😆🤬"
16,@desiraecherie It’s because E might accidentally be confused as standing for “Excellent”
17,@Alphaca_NFT @CryptoMories #Famorie values 🥰 welcome! https://t.co/rOxvYJU1h4
18,Here's your sneak peak into the future. @officialboredAi 🤯 https://t.co/wdkfCJrvnk
19,"@officialboredAi @benartzi @Bancor @tmuskal @BeniHakak All-stars? Y'all are being modest. Legends, superstars at least. LFG! The future is bright"
20,"I don't know that I've ever been more excited about a crypto project. I'm honored to be involved in the https://t.co/qNTsLiRGAl community as an Ape Ambassador, and looking forward to big things coming from this team of crypto/defi/NFT superstars. https://t.co/vOpuwyhrA9"
21,"@bitcoin_wales @tmbg Same here...and wow I'd have to count it up but it would be pretty close to that number. I think that means either we're both super smart, or total nerds... maybe both? 🤣"
22,@crystalhefner The Degen Academy
23,"@bitcoin_wales @tmbg I’ve seen TMBG in concecert probably more than any other band, and they were my first concert (at age 15 circa 1991-2). Hopefully they reschedule."
24,"As a freedom maximalist, I loved this insight from @benartzi (paraphrasing): 

""NFTs help people realize what crypto is all about: giving humans the power of self-sovereignty, freedom, and ownership of our digital identity and our digital lives.""

Amen, brother! #NFTCommunity"

31,"@PabloEnriqueEsq Un abrazo, amigo 💙"
32,@MartyBent Of all things a government could (and should) rightfully be worried about.... they choose to go after crypto. smh.
33,"RT @jchervinsky: In the 20th century, governments tried to restrict individual ownership of cryptography. They failed.

In the 21st century…"
34,"@defidefenselaw I enjoyed the discussion, thanks for hosting - definitely looking forward to future discussions about the intersection of crypto/NFTs/blockchain and the law."
35,@KelliStretesky Thank you. 💙
36,"What’s more exciting than NFTs, you ask? How about a spaces full of lawyers talking about NFTs and the recent OpenSea lawsuit! ⚖️ 💼 https://t.co/U5uVTGGSK9"
37,@LasVegasNFT @NFTVegas_ We are becoming an NFT hub!?? That's great news!  Good thing I'm heading back to Vegas after my 3-month sabbatical soon :)
38,"@jhyanstrudel ...g.  

Ugh, being a perfectionist lawyer is so difficult when you can't edit tweets to fix typos! 😩"
39,@jhyanstrudel Thank you Cap'n! :) #hologang is the best gan
40,"@NateDigital Thank you, friend. It's good to know my #hologang always has my back and is there for me when needed. 👊💙"
41,@NFT_ANDY_ Thank you fren 😄🥰
42,"@R_Sreekanth Brilliant, but what good is it after today? Lol. Maybe for someone born today or married today it would be cool."

44,"@SwoleLuksoBags @madsincognito 80s and 90s were the best time to be a kid, then teenager, then college student, and no one can convince me otherwise."
45,"@SwoleLuksoBags I was a practicing lawyer without a cell phone for a few years before I went big time and got a Motorola Razr flip phone. It was a beautiful time, pre-cellphones. I actually read encyclopedias as a kid. That was my internet, lol."
46,"I have not been well lately, dealing w/ some personal issues and mental health struggles I’m fighting to overcome. The chaos and cruelty in the world hasn’t helped.

To anyone wondering where I went or why I’ve not gotten back to you, please forgive me and know I’m working on it."
47,"Gm, and happy Palindrome Day (22/02/2022) to everyone except for those in the US, for whom it’s just a day with lots of 2s (02/22/2022)"
48,@jriets This is the way👊
49,@jriets I have found myself downgrading my lifestyle since going all-in on crypto/NFTs: Spending as little fiat as possible so I have more disposable income to invest.
50,"It angers me that the mainstream media FUD and CeGov have kept many individuals from buying #BTC (or worse, persuaded some to sell at a loss or w/ only small gains). #Bitcoin doesn't have the same impact when held by institutions. Nevertheless, we are about to launch: 2022 🚀🚀 https://t.co/OTQpBQJb7l"
51,Can't wait to see the game theory progressions play out. https://t.co/iVcmmUtB3H
52,"RT @_livnft: Couples who NFT together, stay together."
53,"@bitcoin_wales Wait wen dis this happen?? Oh, Jan 4th.. apparently I missed it. Congrats!!"
54,@bitcoin_wales Doge coin to the moon and adopted as legal tender?
55,@jhyanstrudel @BoredCoffee_ @nothing @getpeid @lionsmilk_eth @BoredApeYC I need to try the @nothing earphones… the fact they come from fellow #hologang visionary @getpeid tells me they will be the earbuds I’ve been searching for
56,@thenftattorney Hope they can also convert their web2 communities. Misinformation among gamers is rampant. I hate to see people tricked into thinking NFTs are bad and evil when in reality they are good and could empower the haters.
57,"@MoreWillie @thenftattorney @TheSmarmyBum Yup, larva labs providing the world with its proof of centralization here."
58,RT @NFTMillionaire: Long-term goals are those that will last the longest.
59,"@SecureFundToken @v1punks @opensea @LooksRareNFT To me, it's pretty simple. The v1 punks are a separate collection from the subsequent CryptoPunks. The blockchain proves, irrefutably, their provenance and current ownership. I don't see how LL could deny their own past public statements - the blockchain doesn't lie."
60,1 ETH = 1 ETH. Important to remember as we watch our jpegs climb in value as overall demand for digital assets rises.
61,@v1punks @opensea @LooksRareNFT This raises myriad legal questions. Not a fan of LL taking this approach at all.
62,"And this is just one example of the inefficiencies and inequities NFTs potentially solve. When you dig into it, it is truly mind-blowing; Revolutionary even."
63,"I believe decentralized social media (not necessarily the platform mentioned in the article, but generally) is going to be a key to giving people power and freedoms back that they have sacrificed more and more over the years to the likes of web2 megacorps"
64,"People who are anti-NFTs in 2022 are going to someday look back and feel really dumb when they understand the potential uses of NFTs; e.g. giving privacy rights over personal data &amp; ownership, equity, and revenue from their digital identities and assets. 

https://t.co/1hro2ZDw32"
65,Exactly as many have predicted: Q1 2022 we will continue to hear about more and more massive institutions investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets. https://t.co/8Zrnx4khX5

71,@thenftattorney Speech is free but it should have consequences - whether good or bad. Crypto/web3 has the power to democratize speech and create a free market for self-regulation of ideas and speach in ways we never could previously.

89,"And yet, Mr Gensler of the SEC has signaled recently that he thinks perhaps even Ether *is* a security. It makes me wonder what kind of tug-of-war might be going on behind the scenes between the CFTC and SEC in terms of wanting to be the head cheese regulator in this space."
90,"Relatedly, the CFTC has long stated that ETH is a commodity, not a security. See official release by CFTC from 2019 (""It is my view as Chairman of the CFTC that ether is a commodity"" - Chairman Tarbert):
