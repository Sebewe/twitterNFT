Here is a 653 tweet thread on why I’m so bullish on @CoolCatsNFT and their role in NFTs and web3.

41,@B4rkNFT I bet they let people in increments based on wallet size and milk earned to date to help balance. Remember 10k pet holders have to buy or earn it to begin
42,"I’m curious what happens to $milk when Cooltopia opens:

A) People rush to evolve their Cool Pets, burning outstanding supply. Price largely unchanged 

B) People dump their milk for a quick buck. Price tanks

C) Attempting to front-run A, people buy $milk, increasing the price"
