0,I need a team for post draft. I have every build out there and can play whatever 1-5. If you need a team or are looking for one lmk. If you’re trying to get drafted there’s no better exposure than playing with me.
1,I don’t even talk 2K like that anymore and won’t talk about it again but Slay not getting picked is crazy. At some point y’all gotta stop just picking your friends.
2,"@Merc2k A lot of the league is about who you’re associated with when it comes to the PF position. It’s tough but it’s the way the cookie crumbles. You’re really young and you have a lot of time to get to where you wanna be. Keep pushing, you made a LOT of progress in a year."

4,@youFamousEnough @CoachTerrell Indeed. Grass isn’t always greener.
5,"@CoachTerrell Took 3 interviews with us, called us pick 10 during the draft and said don’t take me. They thought they were solidified elsewhere 😂."
6,@CoachTerrell We had someone call us at pick 10 and tell us not to take them. Stuns me to this day lmao.
7,@BleacherReport If he needs to miss 6-8 weeks why in the world would he play in a meaningless all star game?

9,@ztins @diedoffgrid @IamKrisLondon What’s the difference between that and players who were at home eliminated saying Apple pack?
10,@diedoffgrid @IamKrisLondon There’s plenty of bad NFL corners. Eli Apple gets clowned because it’s trendy right now. He didn’t play that bad in comparison to how Cooper Kupp usually does NFL corners.
11,@IamKrisLondon Because people ride waves so right now it’s cool to clown him so everyone does

98,@_oFAB @SplashEdition I played the game less than majority of PG’s last year and played better. I don’t think play retail does anything. You have almost two months of everyday scrims when you get into market.
99,@stoolpresidente Packers are in for a ride awakening next year. They better cherish Rodgers while they can.
