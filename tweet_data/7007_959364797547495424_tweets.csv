32,I’d can understand wanting to digitize artwork where the artist is no longer living.  But will people/market agree that a museum has that right/authority.
33,What do people think of @LaCollectionOff? An art museum creating NFTs of physical works. To me the question is whether the market will believe or recognize that an institution can create “official” NFTs from artwork created by someone else.

38,@UnknownCo123 The only way it lives digitally is through the nft so not an issue.  Also artists whose craft is best created physically I think have a place digitally too and shouldn’t have to change their methods for anyone else’s idea of what an nft should be
39,@ArtHouseGarbage Not sure if ur limiting to 1/1s or also pfp projects but by then I won’t be around to know.  All i know is the present and if ur gonna hold something with a chance of maintaining value long term best shot is with the ones most recognized now.

76,@penguin_curator @0x_fxnction @the_x2y2 They marketed being fairer distribution than $looks bc of the wash trading. Looks didn’t owe anyone anything either.

90,@LosSwayze @DiscoverXnft @Greekdx I tend to believe not bullying or abusing ur power of influence to extort people is something u know is wrong and don’t need to “learn” that by getting caught.  Great she apologized doesn’t mean ppl have to accept/welcome her back.  She had way more than 5k followers at the time
91,@LosSwayze @DiscoverXnft @Greekdx She also bullied/threatened people in dm saying to give her this and that or she’ll fud a project.  That came out when someone didn’t budge and tweeted the exchange
92,@hbarstyle @JoeTheLim @the_x2y2 I do like looks but didn’t buy it just claimed and staked. So I don’t have any exposure to it more than what I claimed.  I actually like competition and think that having everyone get a claim with x2y2 is better. I didn’t like the 3ETH arbitrary cutoff from Looks

99,@le_coinnoisseur @the_x2y2 You’re right I should have been more accurate and said  only the team and few early claimers get to stake and earn high APR (without taking added risk of buying and staking).. .  Free Claim and Stake vs Buy and Stake is not fair  one is risk free the other isn’t
