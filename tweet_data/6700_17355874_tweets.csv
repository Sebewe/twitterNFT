70,"@kevimlee I think it depends on the NFT too. If you have hot NFT’s like mfers, they’re very liquid. I had 15 offers today and still five hours left in day. Some NFTs you can’t hardly give them away."
71,I posted this on 12/2/21 and it’s still true! mfer = mfer - one of a kind. https://t.co/xuoH2FyVNr
