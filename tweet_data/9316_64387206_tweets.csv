1,"@shiftrefresh Yeah mate, it’s been crazy few days! We are all safe and dry and very lucky at this point. A lot of Brisbane suburbs is not so lucky 😔"
2,"@wanitaZFourie Yeah, we are all safe and dry. Craziest time was when we were driving and almost got caught in a flash flood in our car but we have a 4x4 so got lucky. The rain has eased up for few hours this morning so hoping that will help 🤞🏽"

9,@SaraJChipps I get that we are just talking about 1 use case right now but looking at the comment section &amp; the rigidness of some people to see NFTs just as a membership tool to an “elite” club is simply a wasted opportunity.
