That's not compassionate man, that's enabling terrible behavior and expecting literally nothing of the people who are here to extract value."
1,@SearchDecoder @cr0ssETH @doodles Your vision of web3 and mine are not the same if you don't want to hold people to higher expectations of personal responsibility.  ngmi.
2,"@SearchDecoder @cr0ssETH @doodles LOL, an average user currently in these markets acting recklessly or impulsively shouldn't be here in the first place until they know what the fuck they're doing.  Imagine telling these devs their creation is ""not good for anyone"" while you hold the $30k asset they created. Weak."

6,"@NFTSasha @cr0ssETH @doodles Imagine owning a $30k+ Nft and not having the mental acumen to properly understand what’s happening each time you interact with a contract, and being that eager to sell.

It was a creative new mechanic imo, people just big mad cuz they big dumb.  No sympathy."
