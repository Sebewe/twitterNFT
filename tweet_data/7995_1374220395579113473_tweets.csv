31,@fvckrender i think i saw them being exploited by the hackers account that is currently exploiting people from openseas. Ask them if they click on an openseas phishing email that migrated their tokens and/or if they interacted with the openseas migration contract.

Look up Slips vs Mistakes for designers"
83,@edzart Why should the contract still exist after a transfer when the person who transferred it was the one who initiated the contract and not the recipient? Haven’t you heard of a recipient’s NFT getting sold for cheap cause a previous owner listed it but never cancelled?
