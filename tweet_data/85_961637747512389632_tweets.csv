2,@ABBBBBB_NFT @Worldwide_WEB3 i hadn’t - looks interesting. can i find more info on this in our mutual discord?
3,@WesNFT @Loopifyyy @harsha_nik i sometimes fud my own bags.
4,"@Loopifyyy @harsha_nik i know. i’m not arguing with your point per say, just didn’t find it helpful even if the observation is accurate. i’m just encouraging folks to support innovation while you’re saying don’t bet on it. i think both are fair statements right now?"

6,@Loopifyyy @harsha_nik you inspired a tweet. https://t.co/NapOsamHzn
7,innovation is how we evolve. embrace projects that push boundaries and try new things. their success is all our success. nfts are more than jpegs. prove that with your support towards future thinking leaders and projects.

41,@VickijEth @jessyscotty1 @SaripSalman scammer? account is suspended.
42,what’s the balance between promoting and exposing community to risk. example: i’ve been airdropped countless fake invisible friends. they’ve been promoting for months prior to launch. inviting scams.
43,@girldadNFT @ABigThingBadly no idea
44,@girldadNFT @ABigThingBadly it’s not completely unrelated to marketplace contracts though. 1 sig to pass many nfts from different collections in 1 tx was because of how opensea designed that part of their system

49,"@cpdis @wdm611 @dagg3rhigh @Treasure_DAO you could take out all this shit and just have a standard that functions across virtual worlds/games for assets. the assets can be on any blockchain in that case, and not tied to any currency, yield farming, or other gimmicky shit, and accomplish the same goals, just better."
