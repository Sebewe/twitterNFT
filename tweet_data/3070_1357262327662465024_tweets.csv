34,"However, I do think there is a way to use this technology without letting it abuse you. It is up to us to define the values we want to promote.

Do feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss some of these points. My DMs are always open."
35,"I am aware all this might sound scary, or at least groundbreaking. Yes, the metaverse and NFTs are about to affect our ways of living, of playing and communicating. I do not think there's any way to stop this technology from being adopted by our society."
36,"If there's one thing I'd like you to remember from this article, it's that NFTs, combined with fungible tokens (e.g. bitcoin, ethereum, USDC…), will open a plethora of new opportunities for all of us. We've only uncovered the tip of the iceberg."
37,"Singers will reward people who attended different events - they'll send them a special invite, send them tokens (e.g. $Beyonce), or even give them a special asset in a game. @Deadmau5 and @RichieHawtin's @Pixelynx_io is a music metaverse that leverages these functionalities."
38,"Communities will stand up against bigger actors to defend their own values, and they'll get the means to do that in a straightforward way, thanks to the blockchain (see @ConstitutionDAO)."
39,"People will also have the opportunity to easily pool resources together to buy assets, thanks to fractionalisation. For example communities are now able to get together to buy a property, a school, or even a golf course (see @linksDAO)."
40,"Even better than the examples above, ingenious governments will reward citizens for their responsible behaviour, instead of punishing them for not behaving as prescribed."
41,"You can reward people for their positive behaviour or their support to a community (see airdrops and lockdrops - e.g. @ENSdomains and @LooksRareNFT).

Artists are now able reward their first collectors, NGOs will soon reward their first donators."
42,"In the future, NFT tech will apply to assets such as houses, cars, brand names. All these assets will be tokenised.
Now, imagine how many ways these can be combined, with fungible tokens (e.g. stablecoins, bitcoin or ether)."
43,"9. Physical assets: This is by far the biggest and most underrated application of NFTs. In the future, a big share of our physical belongings will be tokenised. Our cars, our houses, our chairs, our computers will come with an NFT."
44,"The gaming community has not understood this yet. Gamers think NFTs are going to extract more value from them, whereas they're about to give back value to the community."
45,"For example, if I managed to upgrade my weapon because I played dozens of hours of Call of Duty, someone might want to rent it from me to improve their stats. @MUSTCometh excels at providing DeFi products to their gamers."
46,"8. Game objects: A very popular category, that stretches from skins and weapons in games to land parcels in metaverse platforms. The @TheSandboxGame and @decentraland are amongst the most appreciated metaverses. Gamers will be able to rent their in-game assets to other players."
47,"7. Web2 Databases: You could turn elements of a database into NFTs. This helps transfer data from one service to another in an easy way. This could also guarantee common standards in the future, something highly needed in databases."
48,"For example, if a platform requires a person's age and country of residency, DID services will confirm that Ms X is &gt;18 years old and that she lives in Germany. DID services will not share more information than required, such as the exact age of Ms X or her exact address."
49,"6. Identity: Aka decentralised identity (DID) or self-sovereign identity. Such services (e.g. @XSL_Labs) allow users to store their credentials on a blockchain, and only share parts of them when required by services."
50,"In effect, @Courtyard_NFT's services enable buyers to easily sell their NFT without having to ship the watch, or the painting to the other end of the world. If a specific buyer wants to have the actual watch or painting, they can ship it to their location by burning the NFT."
51,"5. Redeemables: This type of NFT represents an underlying asset (e.g. a watch or a painting). By burning the NFT, you can get access the underlying physical asset.@Courtyard_NFT is paving the way in this field.

52,"Artists benefit from countless options here.
The French artist Jacques took an inventive approach by dissecting one of his songs, second by second. Each second was sold as an NFT, which enabled him to raise enough funds to cover the costs of producing his whole album ."
53,"4. Music: Songs can also be stored as NFTs. There are many ways this can take place  -  e.g. the artist can keep the commercial rights, they can transfer them to the customer, or the song can only be made available to be streamed."
54,"Marketing agencies / companies / brands can issue special offers to customers that can prove that they have attended different events, or bought special assets."
55,"3. Access: Access is usually granted through a POAP (@poapxyz). Concretely, you receive an NFT with a QR code that gives you access to the event. After this event, you can keep this NFT that will show that you have attended the event."
56,"Other projects such as the @BoredApeYC, @TheHashmasks, @RTFKTstudios's CloneX provide passive income. Owners occasionally receive airdrops (either in the form of an NFT, or in the form of fungible tokens) that they can sell for a profit."
57,"Well, CC0 is the best way to leverage network effects (see Metcalfe's Law). Indeed, the more people create derivatives of the project and share it, the more it becomes popular and the bigger its network/community. As the network grows, its value grows exponentially."
58,"The trending @cryptoadzNFT by the brilliant @SuperGremplin uses CC0, i.e. no rights are reserved and anyone can use these images without owning them. To many people CC0 seems like a silly idea - why would a collector buy an NFT if anyone can right-click save?"
59,"2. PFPs (Profile Pictures) and avatars: Epitomised by @Cryptopunks, these represent people's online identity. They range from simple pixelated 2D images to high-quality 3D avatars (CloneX).
Many PFP projects experiment with IP rights."
60,"1. Art: Digital art, as shown by @RefikAnadol, and generative blockchain art such as @ArtOnBlockchain's Chromie Squiggles.

61,"A framework to categorise NFTs

9 types of NFTs ( building on @cdixon's initial proposition) https://t.co/tLEWFueaHy"
62,"4. Creator Economy:
Creators own the content they create, they can benefit from royalties whenever one sells their creation. They can also easily reach out to their followers. In contrast, current social media platforms extract most value from creators."
63,"3. Security:
The blockchain is the most secure online database out there. Its inherent nature makes it extremely hard to hack."
64,"2.Transferability:
In a couple of clicks, the ownership of an asset can be transferred from one part of the world to another part."
65,"1. Transparency:
You can think of the blockchain as a public ledger that records all the transactions that were made since its inception. It's very straightforward to check what was bought when, and for what price."
66,"An NFT is a medium in itself. It represents proof of ownership of any asset. 

So instead of having a piece of paper stating that you own your car, or your house - the proof is stored on the blockchain, which brings key advantages:"
