1,"@NFTLoverBoy @SpeculatorArt @piovincenzo_ @EasyEatsBodega Honesty 6 weeks just isn’t enough time or 1 ETH just isn’t enough for the timeline. Heck, you can blow 0.1 ETH on gas trying to pickup a Wonderpal mint."
2,"@crypto_raiders Gotta get my hands on a Tigress at some point. In a completely innocent, “go get me some grimweed” way of course."
3,"RT @crypto_raiders: We just hit 25k followers! Let's do a Gen 1 Old Man giveaway to celebrate 🚀

4,@run4pancakes @pvermont Oh hai DevDAO fam! Speaking the truth though!
5,"@pvermont @run4pancakes Yep, still a thing. Same for RTs if your state / country uses them."
6,@NAZALKARADAN @andreasklinger That's why they stagnate so hard.
7,"@NathanCRoth I'd agree with everything but the ""long roadmap"". A low mint price can force the team remaining small. I think it's similar to the ""fast, cheap, good"" paradox, high mint price would map to shorter roadmap (accomplished faster) and low mint price would force longer roadmaps."
8,"@atifkhan31 @sriramk I'm guessing Facebook, mostly because literally NO ONE wants the ""zuck"" metaverse. It will be soulless and unethically monetized. (and then I see you're ex-Meta. haha)"
9,"@ericsNFT @cryptocom Definitely worth it. Go for at least Jade / Purple and you’re at 10% CRO back, free spotify monthly, free Netflix, airport lounge free, etc. only card I use online when I have to pay with fiat."
10,"@playbigtime @opensea Get ready for the Bigtime floor tile sale. That’s right, you can own the ground the characters are walking on in game for only 5ETH per tile."
11,"@Rudi_1970 @playbigtime Star Citizen repeated. Just promise a ton, drip out content, see what people buy the. Offer more of it. (Ohhh fancy spaceships) This is just sad now."
12,@playbigtime This is Star Citizen all over. Now you’re selling access to the game? Come on. Do better blockchain gaming.
13,@playbigtime @opensea Man. Just a whole lot of sales up in here. When will there be something for the people actually giving you money. This reminds me of Star Citizen ngl.
14,"@coinmamba Honestly, it’s really Chronos that’s winning rn. Serious progress over there every day with a ton of quiet stackers."
15,@ZssBecker Stick to crypto buddy. Virtue signaling people who are virtue signaling is still virtue signaling.
16,@andy8052 ACK is a grep replacement in a terminal environment. Searches stuff on a computer. (If this is a dev context)
17,@crypto_raiders I love it! But wen Heroku gonna let the site live again?
18,"@TeamGaryVee @garyvee @ApplePodcasts This is true, but I’m not sure I like attaching kindness to the monetary benefit in any way. I would have for the “reason” people are ever kind to become financial in nature."
19,"@ablahid @ZssBecker And horses were a mode of transportation first. Problems evolve, the solutions must as well."
20,@ZssBecker @THEkrby Doesn’t follow directions. Wins. Haha
21,"RT @FTX_Official: The next ₿ig thing is here, even if Larry can’t see it.

We’re giving away 7.54 #bitcoin right now to celebrate! 

How to…"
22,@niftyportal @allnick Looking forward to all of it! https://t.co/KBAsc8twzT
23,"@SpeculatorArt Printing US dollars also has a (basically) zero cost since there is no longer a tangible cost to print them (gold etc), I guess Chris also acknowledges that they have no value."
24,@etoeth Ahh. Govt contractors. I needed a flexible Wednesday due to schools adjusting dismissals for manning issues. I was also asked to have my wife take care of it. I replied “the assignments within my family obligations aren’t the concern of the company. I’m asking for what I need.”
25,@SpeculatorArt This is gross. I’d sell also.
26,"@Zssbecekier @ZssBecker You’re literally asking the guy you’re impersonating to send you a dm, bot. Not even a smart bot."
27,@reactor_motors This doesn’t look like a race car to me
28,@NFTethics @SpeculatorArt Ridiculous.. Thanks for sharing!
29,@asdernr @allnick True. But to continue it: “and then ruin them”. Haha
30,@allnick If that’s true I’m bearish on Sandbox
31,@ZssBecker Tiny bank account? Is the answer tiny bank account?
32,"@willworthdev @developer_dao Thanks @willworthdev I’m in, as long as they’re actually talking WETH on Polygon and not ETH on main net that requires me to pay $80 in gas. Thanks again for the info!"
33,@willworthdev @developer_dao I see there’s some staking required. Not seeing a lot about that in the faq. Anyone have details?
34,"@SafemoonChance Just a heads up, $TKNFY is an NFT launchpad not a marketplace like $looks"
35,@SpeculatorArt I would replace 33% cash with 30% stable coins staked at 6-10% and we good.
36,@crypto_raiders I’m in! Enjoying it so far! Nice work. https://t.co/bZYPIxJX6w
37,@sippndipp @willworthdev @developer_dao Hey fam! Looking forward to seeing what you’re up to. Followed!
38,@dafne_sugar @willworthdev @developer_dao Sweet! Looking forward to hearing about it in dev DAO. Followed. Go get it!
39,@wormholecowboy @willworthdev @developer_dao Sounds pretty cool. Following along now!
40,@ramiechaarani @willworthdev @developer_dao Followed! Nice to meet you. 5040 here!
41,@willworthdev @developer_dao Hey fam! #5040 here. I did a blockchain nanodegree in 2017 and now I’m refreshing / updating web3 knowledge for a job switch here soon. Thanks for the hard work in dev DAO! As soon as I’m feeling “almost comfortable” I’m jumping in head first.
42,"@dabit3 I’ve started buying tools for hand woodworking, that’s where I’m going to out my attention when I’m back to having free time at all. I’ve also heard leather-working, physical arts, and instruments are good choices. Basically anything that’s gets us away from the desk. GL!"
43,"@dabit3 Wow. You just completely described the last 2/3 of my life. Pick a hobby building something with your hands. I heard it's very good for people like us. Wouldn't know for sure though, who has time for that when there's all this web3 to build? haha"
44,@nateliason @SpeculatorArt @crypto_raiders I’m one of them. Let’s go!
45,"@RyanCoordinator @RyanCoordinator for governor! I mean steward. Well, Ryan for anything really."
46,"@ToxicAlldaylong Looks like you retired and bought an island, strong move. Buh dun chhhh"
47,"@ZssBecker @verified @verified Pretty ridiculous to deny verification when the impersonation is so prolific. It’s literally every reply, with hundreds of fake accounts. I guarantee Twitter’s inaction is causing many to be scammed."
48,@JCX @ZssBecker 0.3% APY is its own reward.
49,@SpeculatorArt Lol. This is the real degen play right here.
50,"@srinigoes @ellaorten @CryptoKitties Haha. Hey fam. I still have 2 from that time. They’re nostalgic for me, but worthless basically “overprinted”. Didn’t we learn from 1990s baseball cards?"
51,@ellaorten Hmm. ETH in 2016. First NFT was a Zed Run horse when they were still on main net. I feel old now.
52,@kentcdodds Use a https://t.co/bV4H6NJ1QO card or similar where you can set a cap. Seriously.
53,"Yes crypto, dump! Dump so I can keep getting cheaper coins. I’ll take them all, thank you. 

Seriously though, buy good projects rn and as it dumps. Nothing will keep crypto down forever."
54,@SpeculatorArt Nice! I missed out on mint so I’m looking out for a few rares here.
55,@SpeculatorArt Any thoughts about which assets you picked up or just a sweep?
56,@CyberartRealm @mard137 @beeple Very cool!
57,@CyberartRealm @mard137 @beeple Was this the OpenAI image API?
58,"@SpeculatorArt I’d be interested in a NFT Alpha episode where you all walk through what you’d do starting over right now with $1k. Solid advice here, definitely threw thousands in the trash early by not being selective."
59,@ChillySelf @ZssBecker Hope you didn’t tell them too much. Scammers all over his stuff.
60,@ZssBecker Lol. It’s the 4th and I don’t know if 0.5% really counts as up.
61,"@SpeculatorArt As in, made worthless by the contract mechanics or just devalued in aftermarket? If that’s by “game design” it’s the dumbest idea ever and just an indication of the team’s mentality."
62,"@RyanCoordinator @Micmac132 @developer_dao @developer_dao #5040 here. Solidity, React, Node, etc skills. Lf full time web3 engineering role."
63,"@ZssBecker If you’re a POS bot, ask me to send you a DM."
64,"@AvalpsFinance Deleted Discord.
Straight from the article “we will not be working much on the project, since we have lost all motivation …”

This is the definition of a rug.
If it walks like a rug, and acts like a rug, it’s a rug."
65,@SpeculatorArt I’m more interested in the ballerinas book you aren’t mentioning. 😜 Merry Christmas dude.
66,"@manifoldxyz This is beautiful, but how are you making money as a VC-backed company? Nothing in the world is free, I'd like to hear about your revenue model."
67,@3seaterr Gm. It back
68,@jtradescoins @mdudas I’m ded… Nice work
69,@sunforgerer @crypto_raiders Appreciate you taking the time on the answers. Thanks!
70,"@sunforgerer @crypto_raiders And just as importantly, are new users penalized in any way (Gen 1 advantages, etc) for coming in later, when the ecosystem needs outside dollars to survive?"
71,"@sunforgerer @crypto_raiders That’s awesome! How much does it cost to get started in CR now though? Honestly don’t know, but are there deflationary mechanisms built in to allow for affordable new user on boarding? This is one thing a lot of decent web3 games miss."
72,@SpeculatorArt Love it man. Just noticing a trend in other threads today that’s rubbing me as a bit nefarious.
73,"@SpeculatorArt Ok. I think that’s fair, assuming the mints are typical as far as ETH goes. $200k - $500k would be my estimation there. I just don’t want too much of this going nuts and before you know it only Nike, Adidas, and the like are “qualified” to create projects."
74,"@SpeculatorArt Serious question. How much is “ok” for project builders to cash out? I get the feeling we’re replacing “DYOR” with “only already established groups can do NFT projects”. That’s scary to me, I enjoy empowering new creators."
75,@nateliason @SpeculatorArt @crypto_raiders Hope everyone has checked the source code of that extension. Really cool to see though.
76,@ZssBecker Gen 14362 coming next week! Get em while there rare. Lol…
77,"@SpeculatorArt @TheDogeBrothers I have no idea what “gg no re” means, but definitely consider myself a gamer. No replay? 🤷‍♂️ idk"
78,@iam_preethi Hey @developer_dao fam! Just found you listening to the town hall. Looking forward to learning from you through that!
79,"@SpeculatorArt Obviously this was also completely against ToS for each game, and bannable if found out."
80,"@SpeculatorArt Many many years ago there was a site called playerauctions. Not sure if it’s still around, but that was the closest thing back 10 or so years ago. Maybe https://t.co/Da2kuj2wMP and find it if it’s down now?"
81,"@ZssBecker 0xeED6a7AA1042742e30c913911235eE768F45Ec20

Going to get a buddy to join also. This is an interesting idea."
82,"@ZssBecker I dig it. 

0xeED6a7AA1042742e30c913911235eE768F45Ec20"
83,"@the1dataninja Not even close. Not to mention it’s borderline illegal, especially if there were no ToS stating as much that was agreed to premint. Hopefully everyone dumps that project immediately."
84,"@SpeculatorArt I don’t have the context, but this is kind of true. The long term risk to crypto is modern cryptography. Which currently has no answer to eminent quantum computing. So in a way, they may have accidentally been right?"
85,"Github Copilot is seriously a competitive advantage.  I heard someone say this already, but I just starting to toy with it and... Wow. This isn't even remotely the smartest thing I've seen it do for me. Maybe you want a custom useLocalStorageState hook? Just start defining it. https://t.co/BaI7qzVuqp"
86,"@SpeculatorArt Pretty accurate, with a close second being the RuneScape economy."
87,"@jdwalters85 @GregoriosPetro1 @traversymedia @Bushblade I’m torn on this one, but perhaps it’s ok that a course most ppl pay $10 for doesn’t get new videos when things go out of date. Q&amp;A seems fine for that. If you need more, pay more. 🤷‍♂️"
88,"Dear paperhands,
Please continue to trade me your share of good projects for below anything resembling a fair price. I’m not one to take advantage, but it seems you’re going to sell anyways. https://t.co/DRTOIss6Tm"
89,@narb_s @developer_dao Hey @developer_dao fam! I checked out your project from the discord. Love it! It will be super helpful for people who are new in the space! Great work!
90,@ZssBeckarx @realLukeParker Do not dm this garbage impostor
91,@elonmusk What the world needs is more whistles.
92,@bloodgoodBTC Haha. Nope. Crypto apes get to 256k or 512k then ape in to 2 terrible projects. Then the run is over.
93,@SpeculatorArt Though there is an argument to be made that MASS adoption influx is so significant that liquidity lockup is a relatively minor issue.
94,"@SpeculatorArt So market dilution? Yep. Getting there quickly if we keep apeing into garbage projects, which locks up liquidity that could go to good projects with high upside potential. No buyers on a project isn’t just bad for the person holding the NFTs."
95,"@Blockworks_ Except for ones that compete with any of its garbage projects, of course."
96,"@APEFATHEReth When was it not? JS clowned from the start, just sayin'."
97,"@YMZhang12 @developer_dao We’re actively working out what new membership and the processes look like. We’re excited to have you, hang in there!"
98,"@SpeculatorArt Slippery slope my friend. You can’t enjoy the benefits of that hard work if you start getting sick a lot or worse. Trust that, I have experience in this area. Haha"
99,Picked up @kentcdodds EpicReact workshops with a super generous discount. Really looking forward to diving in over the coming weeks!
