8,Love @doodles but I think the dual listing may disrupt the market dynamics in a negative way.

11,"@iwwon_official @sabet Thanks for the update.

Do we have an estimated timeline for the OpenSea relist? Even the best guess?"
12,@CaptainMorie @iwwon_official Thanks!
13,@Nate_Rivers Won’t function well as a PFP but it’s decent.
14,@edcentralized @CryptoMories Actually a good idea... swapping these out. https://t.co/xTdkRgvDHu

16,@adutchbro BARGAIN bragging or what?! =)
17,@CryptoMories Don't let a day go by w/out at least one update across your social channels. Update your webpage with information as well.
18,"I hope that @iwwon_official and @CryptoMories make it a point to Tweet an update once per day, even if the update is ""we don't have anything new to report""

Communication is critical right now."
19,@mrmakerbot Too low!
20,"@RealDuckMaster @iwwon_official @CryptoMories @noncoducks As long as they make it a point to Tweet an update once per day, even if the update is ""we don't have anything new to report"", I'm good. 

I'm all-in but continued communication is critical right now. https://t.co/ZW1qr4l2TY"
21,"@ETHPain Same issue. 

Pretty weak that OS doesn't have a notice-up."
22,"@RockafellaApes @CryptoMories I have 18 including some rares. Not at all pleased by this turn of events, but still have belief in the founders.

That said, wondering was the DMCA that kept the collection from being verified in the first place? The timing here seems suspect."

35,@0xwinky What tracking is that?
36,"@itskunj @steveb_crypto @Nate_Rivers Briefly, the @WeatheReportNFT original artist had a falling out w/ the team, some drama ensued, and then said artist went on to drop @DentedFeelsNFT in front of WR with very similar art. Lose-lose scenario IMHO."

47,@thesn3akermafia @jositoNFT @Investomentals @Nate_Rivers @konop @powpaomusic He was a hired gun being art directed. The art was a collaborative effort.
48,@jake_spitty @doodles Six minimum.

50,"@NathanHeadPhoto Ditto, minus Mfers cause I didn't miss that"
51,"@Nate_Rivers @DentedFeelsNFT @WeatheReportNFT WR made their own bed by bad mouthing the artist out the door… should have just let it go. That’s not to say the artist is right, because releasing basically the same art in front of WR is just a cash grab sour grapes move."

71,"@SteveG60117 Gear isn't going to move the dial for any project unless fashion is their ball of wax. 

Factor in inventory, shipping, returns, processing, customer service, and labor, unless you're moving 1000s of items a week your margins are going to be very slim. The upside is overrated."
72,@SheikhAnggur @The_Moon_Boyz Strong like ox!
73,@Mswim84 @The_Moon_Boyz Lambo time!
74,"@PoTeEZiE @alienfrens It really took off after what Sartoshi wrote last week.

Alien Frens has a much better ownership distribution. I think long-haul mFers comes back down."
75,@notmbwNFT @fudye_ @doodles My point is that there are scores of companies that can put your Doodle (or two) on anything from a hat to a polo or a mug or a backpack. https://t.co/iEuHqFkN35
76,"@notmbwNFT @fudye_ @doodles I had an NFT screened on a golf shirt (Under Armour) that I gave to my brother and I think my version sized better (larger). I've made stickers and mugs as well. 

These guys do a pretty good job on embroidery but there are minimums. https://t.co/Gf0ayU63eB"
77,"@EB7 I just see a lot of downside risk. 

Running a small Shopify store takes a lot of time and effort and unless you're selling 1000's units a week margins are going to be thin. Inventory, fulfillment, returns, customer service, all are labor intensive and need to be done right."

80,"@mrmakerbot You can do it yourself! 

There are dozens of sites that allow you to create your own. I used @stickergiant for stickers and @merchology for gear on a number of different NFTs."
81,"@starism001 It's not just L.A. 

At the end of the day, people want to be successful in the NFT space, and success almost always comes before any real altruism."
82,I've been a broken record saying this exact thing since the summer. https://t.co/ZGcdMCpgmB
83,"@GencoLaw @larvalabs YES. I've been saying this since August.  

Cut out the middlemen and secure your collections from fraud. Make your website your hub for information, build your own exchange/marketplace, and own your community (vs building a community on Discord that that Discord owns)."
84,@BrownThom Half the price if you order 6 items... https://t.co/D5zowlPaMG
85,"@BrownThom Just order your own stuff there are dozens of online shops that will allow you to create your own gear. 

You can control the look and the quality. I had gear made at https://t.co/6elDnenpbv and stickers at https://t.co/Ae6yh5c4RM"
86,"@accidentalsport @kashviETH Given that Discord owns those NFT projects communities you think they would, but that's not what drives their revenue so very little incentive."
87,"@kashviETH Projects shouldn't be using Discord as their main communications hub.

Websites are easier to secure and manage, put all official links and information on your own project's website, use Discord and Twitter for outreach and support."
88,@Degentraland @doodles IMHO it's not worth the trouble. Revenues will be modest and they're taking on a ton of work and downside risk w/ little upside. It's corporate promo-level stuff people could make on their own.
