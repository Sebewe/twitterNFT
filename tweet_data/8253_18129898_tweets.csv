I want to cry — this is what happens when you make it frictionless to donate."

41,"Put it into historic context, we have  a lot to thank to Satoshi. He solved a problem temporarily, and created an industry and a movement we all have a lot to thank to. But it’s a grave mistake to stop innovating and resorting to dogma."
42,"Based on this, PoW is a parasitic model that is incentivised to use up all available energy, and would die instantly if energy would be universally cheap/free. Thinking about it that way, PoW is fucked."
43,"Based on the above, one might think that the only saving grace of PoW would be if humanity would gain access to unlimited free energy. But funnily enough, infinite energy would mean the instant death of PoW. Because then everyone would have infinite hashrate."
44,"So logically, any present and future energy optimization and energy saving technique is meaningless in the context of Proof Of Work.
Proof Of Work is doomed to fail."
45,"Every other action would put them into disadvantage against their competitors.
PoW incentivizes hash rate maximalization, and using all the energy at the miners’ disposal."
46,"I have just realised that It is logically impossible for Proof Of Work to ever reduce energy consumption.
Let’s say a new chip hits the market that is 10x more energy efficient than the current one.
Then miners will not save 90% of the energy, but increase their hash rate 10x."
47,"@0xMidnight So when it comes to POW, all energy optimisation techniques are meaningless by definition."
48,"@0xMidnight Also any and all optimization of energy consumption will be just used to mine more. For example if the much rumoured 10x more efficient Nvidia chip will be available, miners won’t save 90% of the energy but will mine 10x more, spending the same amount of energy."
