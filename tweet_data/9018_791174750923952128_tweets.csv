81,"@tommychong @BoredApeYC Next puff for you, legend. https://t.co/EM75lgrqRq"
82,@grape8isback @bored_belle @opensea @BoredApeYC @JasonJape How could blockchain validate a token move without the holding wallet approving it. The seed phrase didn’t come with the ledger right? Stupid q but something doesn’t make sense. Once it leaves wallet with listing it should not be possible to just take from new one.
83,"@ShardiB2 Thank you Shardi! Wife and i got several after you first posted. VG decision, and still think this is going much further. Great project."
84,@grape8isback @bored_belle @opensea @BoredApeYC @JasonJape You started the new wallet/ledger with brand new seed phrase?
85,@cryptoguru87 Yes. Agreed. BUT m2 serum = limiting factor to you having a matching mutant. Kinda of like “you can adopt or do this expensive procedure to have your own baby”.
86,"@grape8isback @bored_belle @opensea @BoredApeYC @JasonJape Just need to know HOW? If you transferred it to new wallet that you never listed it for sale on, how could rarible or anyone just remove it without you signing off? You need to give permission somehow."
87,@cryptopoopie @exitliquidity1 The most $ape.
88,@SunD3vil27 @exitliquidity1 Damn. An all matching set like this definitely needs to get an extra multiplier.
