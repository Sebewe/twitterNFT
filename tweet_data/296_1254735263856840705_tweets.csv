1,RT @PUMA: New PFP… what do you think @coolcatsnft? https://t.co/KkfYitj9WX
2,@boredgentleman Gambling is exactly what ignorant dip shits said about BTC/ETH just a few months ago.
3,@Philneeds it's already here. @coolcatsnft and Cooltopia is the leader of PFP projects entering the P2E space.
4,@JeeniusETH Cutting your losers is a skill. Practice makes perfect.
5,@WonderPals can't wait to jump in!
6,don't people realize THIS is the time to be buying and accumulating good NFTs?
7,@SpeculatorArt FUD ser.

13,Who also thinks @Imaginary_Ones flips @InvsbleFriends???
14,Congrats to @WonderPals team for selling out! Love the art and can’t wait for reveal🌈!!!! https://t.co/yxLAbHKg6e
15,@uclart_ @coolcatsnft @LazyAssassin3 Welcome Fren
16,@WonderPals Why don’t you just share the eligible wallets rather than keep everyone guessing? I’ve shared ETH to friends who didn’t have 0.1 to allow them to participate. Would hate to be disqualified for supplying ETH.
17,@amz24s @WonderPals there's better chances than it being a regular public mint. plus they aren't allowing direct contract minting so everyone will be at equal footing.
18,@WonderPals @cyberbutterflyx this mint process does make sense considering you're trying to sell out. can you at least share the eligible wallets?
19,@thefatbitcoin2 you're going to make it.

24,@NicoleBehnam that's why don't trade NFT and just buy/hold high conviction blue chips. #lifelessons
25,"@SweetBeanDazz i minted 3Landers, gave one to my friend for mint value. Now he's in the matrix."
26,"@lostpropheteth @WonderPals @0xMrBoba No, they'll re-run their raffle from the initial pool of valid wallets."
27,"@mooncat2878 @InvsbleFriends The reality is, traditional 2D PFP is way better looking and functions better as a PFP than a fully bodied animation. IF was all hype, having proved nothing."
28,RT @WonderPals: We have a handful of terrifyingly cute ZombiePals! 💚 https://t.co/ByNkFEQyMS
29,RT @ThGoodKnight: I don’t need blue chips. I just need blue cats.
30,@SpeculatorArt It’s not the best but rather most feasible to achieve today versus being a trailblazer and potentially failing on a new frontier.
31,"@LazyAssassin3 @coolcatsnft @Ghxsts nevermind, found it thru your OS portfolio. I almost bought the Polygon scam collection."
32,@LazyAssassin3 @coolcatsnft @Ghxsts Can you share the link to the OS sale? Can't seem to find it.
33,@TappySF Just wait for Cooltopia.
34,"@NathanHeadPhoto not low enough. over priced, over hyped project. i'll pick one up at &lt;1E."
35,Keep it simple stoopid.
36,"A good number of #NFT trait is a maximum of 6. I don't need 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 traits. All it does is take away from the beauty of the art. @BoredApeYC @coolcatsnft @doodles are prime successful examples. Number of traits is a big factor in my due diligence process."
37,Good entry of Invisible Friends at &lt; 1 ETH. #overpriced #badforNFT
38,I was never a fan of @InvsbleFriends and today's underwhelming reveal further supports my lack of conviction. It's evident 2D PFP #NFT is still King 👑.

41,@cryptomanran They’re in trouble if they haven’t been buying the dip
42,@brrrocto @WonderPals WonderPals are too cute to resist.
