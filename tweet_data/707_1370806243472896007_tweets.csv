5,@IAPonomarenko Jeez! I just made this hypothesis. Like he wanna make something huge to enter in the history just as his « H word » role model…
6,"@magnoliamegan_ Well 1st, utility in nft is an illusion. 99% are basically scam with no real mechanism/tokenomics. Art is a valide &amp; immutable fundamental utility. 2nd, they are highly recognizable w/ its own direction, better than most copy out there. Last, it’s subjective, look at some picasso"

9,@RiftyNFT This is the way! Hope this one will fall in a true hodler and DF believer wallet 👌🏻

11,"@JoseColchao @wilson_eth Except if you are from/close to the team and want to over hype the launch and pump it like it's hot👀🤐 no, impossible! wait ?.. 💀"
12,@PuffYatty How we are sure it’s not part of the strategy to make the launch pump af? 🙃
13,@Elimy_GM @CountryBlumpk1n Def! They are even already certified on OS while they haven’t release something yet! Where some other projects with +20k ETH in sales are not already certified…

17,"@G00NR @BigBoi @0x_mfers Just informing people what they are really buying :). Afraid of something or ? Those kind ""Derivatives"" who do 0 work on it, are just here to take advantage of uncultivated people. It's Pitiful 😌. 
This is only information and fact."
18,@BigBoi @0x_mfers This is not a Mfers my fren. You are supporting art stealer. just so you to know..
19,@ColinLieb Definitely.
20,@PhotosTravers Nice work my fren!
21,@kevin_kiggs @PuffYatty @sartoshi_nft It was at mint price for a month.
22,"@LeahLamarr ""Art"" is a valid roadmap. Just sayin' :)"
23,@mecdot @betty_nft @psych_nft Oh ok I see the point. Interesting :)
24,@mecdot @betty_nft @psych_nft It's not a 1/1 Howlerz ? :o
25,@mecdot @betty_nft @psych_nft the 2nd one is not a deadfrenz.
26,"@PoTeEZiE @alienfrens Im holding some AF and as soon as I saw the Mfers 2 months ago, I immediately thought they were gonna explode, they are just differents, not like a lot of current shit out there all based on copy or useless fake utility :)"

44,@spottingham @BobbyBananasNFT People who came with those kind of idea are ready to do everything ahah! $100 mint vs min 100eth appearance 😅 (btw it's only available in 4 countries atm)
45,"@spottingham @BobbyBananasNFT Tbh not really, at least at first sight. I mean people can still  ""right clic save"" then mint the stolen one. They will  have an hex BAYC or something else. You will need to clic on details to confirm. The problem is also the tons of shitty derivatives."

56,@Domenik03930551 @CaptainDadpants @sadsigns_ @LooksRareNFT I really hope so! And I also hope it's gonna push OS to be competitive back with LR.
57,"@CaptainDadpants @sadsigns_ @LooksRareNFT Yes, it wasnt hater com. Just said why people haven't moved yet. If you know exactly what to buy, yes it's gonna be ok. But if you wanna enjoy exploring etc your xp is gonna be lame. Im not the LR PO for prioritize the backlog. UX first and ""Invalid offers/bid"" are big pain imo"
58,"@CaptainDadpants @sadsigns_ @LooksRareNFT Yes Yes. That's what I just said, I mean they are really new and it's gonna be better and better. At the moment there is a big room for improvement and bug fix. Just said that ""yet"" people need a better experience overall before moving than just rewards."
59,"@sadsigns_ @LooksRareNFT Rewards its users, yes. Truly cares, not yet. They really need to improve UI/UX and fix some issues. It's new so they will implement incrementally and users will gradually adopt LR. At the same time, I hope this will push OS to rewards its users the same way :)"
