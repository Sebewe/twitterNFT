9,@danielgothits Rugger? I hardly know her! Got curious about the split in language so I figured I’d share my findings: (tl;dr - Britain started it and then rugged its usage to be less “American-sounding”) https://t.co/BnCizdIHAA
10,"@danielgothits I’ve tried 🤦🏼‍♀️ and yeah, gets way too confusing. Most people will realize your American, what sport you mean, and let you call it soccer without too much shame. Saying football instead of soccer is more confusing than using your own word unless you go all out with fútbol!"

16,@JonSetter @raven50mm Been a while since doing light math 🧮 but the 400 sounds fun! Did you get a sense the scenes “look hotter” with the 400?
17,"@JonSetter @raven50mm The higher iso can be good if you have a manual setting and want to close down your aperture for deeper depth of field (more of the scene in focus) for architecture, landscape, crowds etc. -    Though if the sun bright enough I believe you can still do this a fair bit with 200."
