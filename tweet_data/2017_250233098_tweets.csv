1,Someone really should write an article about how pixelmons and Kevin perfectly embody how post-Covid/mid-climate change surrealism is the modern version of Dadaism.
2,@ErikVoorhees @defiprime I remember reading about both the filecoin and decentralaand icos thinking ‘this shit will never work’ and that taught me once again that I know nothing.
3,Talking about “securing the border” bro libertarians don’t recognize borders
4,@fintechfrank @JoeBiden Chicago school lunatics who previously thought ‘monopoly good’ started realizing that they are not in reality that good.
5,There may be nothing more cringe than people who think they are being ‘crypto libertarians’ but are actually just acting Trumpian.

11,"people who post “i don’t know anything about Russia or Ukraine or the war so I’m not going to say” anything are either:

37,@JessTheVC Is this one of those “post a controversial/unpopular opinion for engagement” posts or just trolling?
38,@RossBarkan I agree we’re likely to hear more sabre rattling but doubt anyone serious will call for that sort of escalation. That means open ear with Russia and there is 10000% no appetite for that from anyone.

That was revealing to me because the amount we spend on things that most people either don’t understand or actively think are fake is actually pretty bonkers."
