In choppy markets, and reversal zones, its better to start from a Top Down Anaylisis (Weekly -&gt; Daily -&gt; 4H -&gt;....).

When we have choppy markets full of FUD, best is to trade important Big Timeframe Zones.

31s where visited and rejection to the downside was experienced. This week should be interesting, with positive outlook."
75,"This means we could see shorting in the short term, while a the same time potential shorting moves, worth keeping an eye on. This is a risky buying zone, thus would recommend buying after 36s are broken, and retested.

#THEGOATOFWALLSTREET"
76,"And price is testing the Daily Candle Upper Range. This creates bearish pressure. One of two scenarios could happen. We get a small retest into de 31s zone, before the expansion of another bullish leg, or institutions might be eyeing Retail Zone #2. (2/3)"
77,"#BTC REVIEW (25.06.2021)

Price has been lacking bullish pressure, and consolidation has been seen in the past days, as price has remained within the daily range for 4 days. Now price is currently testing the liquidity zone created by stop hunting retail zone #1 and https://t.co/wCYzIwZC1m"

79,"#BTC REVIEW (14.06.2021)

Price is following its way up to liquidity zone 44,630. Due to big price imbalances left on yesterday’s retest, I would expect a slight retest once this zone is reached. Later, when 47s are reached, we must remain alert to shorts. 

#THEGOATOFWALLSTREET"
80,"#BTC REVIEW (11.06.2021)

Price is headed towards de liquidity zone of 47k, as our previews analysis suggest. Nevertheless, I would love to see a retest on 34k in order to create a Daily higher Low, and then we should see 40k resistance being broken.
