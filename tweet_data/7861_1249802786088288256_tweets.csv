0,@LloydzCrypto @CBCreepz You should definitely take a deep-dive into @CatBloxStudios My biggest bet beside @CBCreepz. They are under the radar with huge backing partners and BIG connections similar to what Creepz just got via @threesixzero
1,"@CatBloxStudios might be one of the most undervalued projects right now based on FP. So many people in the NFT space have no clue what kind of connections and partnerships Catblox's have up their sleeve. Way too many people do no research, it's kinda hilarious to see.👀🥛"
2,"I see investing in NFTs as the same as investing in startups. DYOR, think long-term and bet on teams that prove they can deliver. NFTs are essentially a new wave of community-owned companies. Treat them that way. 1 NFT = 1 share in the company. @CBCreepz🦎 @CatBloxStudios🥛"
3,"RT @CBCreepz: Creepz is now represented by @threesixzero to explode us into a global mega-brand.

They represent superstars such as Will Sm…"
4,"@PhilsUnlucky @CBCreepz @threesixzero @BoredApeYC @worldofwomennft Bullish on @CBCreepz. @CatBloxStudios also has a massive partnership like this actually. Backed by Future Corp (Dua Lipa, Kanye, PS5, Kaws ++) That was their key to landing the recent partnership with @PUMA. Betting BIG on both @CBCreepz and @CatBloxStudios"
5,@CBCreepz My math is obviously wrong. The missing 1% will die before mint ;))
6,"The NFT space right now is like the dot-com boom and bust in the late 90s. 97% of the projects will fail, but 2% will prosper and become wildly successful. Invest in teams and founders that prove they can execute strategically on their long-term visions. Congrats @CBCreepz fam🦎 https://t.co/993i1s5j7z"

22,@carlosgil83 @CatBloxStudios @PUMA https://t.co/InBbzE1rQ0
23,"@carlosgil83 @CatBloxStudios @PUMA The art is minimalistic with a premium feel, they don’t have normal traits such as hats, sunglasses, and so on... but textures and materials (Like a statue or physical piece). The reveal is tomorrow. They have hinted that physicals versions will play a role going forward"
24,"@carlosgil83 @CatBloxStudios @PUMA They aim to become a company that makes it easy for big brands to enter the NFT space. First out is PUMA, with many other big names to come"
25,"@carlosgil83 @CatBloxStudios @PUMA Yeah! I really think they are cooking up something big. They have partnered with Future Corp / Supershop . xyz which have connections with some really big brands and names (KAWS, Dua Lipa, Tyler the creator, PS5 ++)"
