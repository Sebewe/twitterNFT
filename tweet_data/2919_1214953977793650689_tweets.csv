0,@natbrunell @100trillionUSD @cvpayne Absolutely crushed it.  Amazing composure and clarity!
1,@EB7 FOMO'd back in at 8.7e this morning.  Basic common and took 1.2e loss.  Was hoping for a little better spread of traits across the collection.
2,"@CryptasticR @pranksy Was talking with @theNFTgigi last night about the project and should've minted before @pranksy went crazy!

Congrats on the overnight sell out!!"
3,@EB7 I don’t mind a 5% royalty under a certain threshold if I’m comfortable with what the project is planning to use the funds for.  I do agree that once a certain floor is hit and/or overall sales volume is hit then they absolutely should consider dropping it!
4,@EB7 @doodles Jokes aside - you chose an amazing Doodle for your LT hold.
5,@EB7 @doodles 🤣🤣 https://t.co/s9lwGfzUvc
6,@frugal_doodle @doodles I want I want I want!
7,"@Amdtrades This is why I struggle with the gold/silver narrative.  How can it be considered a store of value when it is the same price it was in 2011, yet the purchasing power of the dollar is significantly less? https://t.co/IVs4qU5Csc"
8,@InvsbleFriends Really is gunna be 250+. Nice!
9,"@frugal_doodle @VinnieHager Been watching you accumulate quite the collection.  Congrats!  I've been searching for the ""perfect"" one for a couple weeks now and after getting sniped on a couple I finally got one I love!"
10,"Finally!

@VinnieHager https://t.co/opEpDKQSdL"
11,@Moramoth @burnttoast @CAMEOPASS @doodles And here I thought it couldn’t get any better!
12,"@RDM_41 The youth of the world grew up on iPhones and tablets and digital is the norm to them so everything will eventually be digital. Sure the currency aspect could be digital dollars, but the youth also have a strong distrust of banks post ‘08 financial crisis / what’s happening now"
13,@EB7 100% agree.  The first NFT that I purchased solely for the art.  (No idea what the pass even is!)
14,Thanks @EB7 for the heads up.  Bought for the art. https://t.co/reuGnLZgEa
15,@DiscoverXnft I’d agree with this and it’s probably because people are upgrading.  This is bound to occur with some current Apes when the next “it project” jumps them in value.  Similar to what happened when Apes flipped Punks.
16,@0xQuit It’s like they created a perfect playbook on how to kill a project in 48 hours.  So many poor decisions made that I would never touch the site!
17,"@Loopifyyy @InvsbleFriends 250e easily.  Charity, Hype, and 5 pre-reveal IF also.  Maybe 250e is too low…."
18,@SlamDiegoZoo @the_x2y2 100%.  Wouldn't be surprised if we found out their approval functions end up draining wallets also.  Complete copy pasta of LR AND they make you list 50 NFT's or 5 different collections to claim.  Hmm...wonder why!?  Be careful.
19,"@CapetainTrippy SSDD.  People blindly follow CT tweets and hype and then get angry when the obvious happens.  If you’re buying something you don’t understand, you’re gambling not investing."
20,@InvsbleFriends Whoa.  So cheap compared to all the other garbage recently released.  Way to take care of your community!
21,"And another one.  Do I even want to know how much this ""project"" made? https://t.co/IM9KT0k8R5"
22,@wokkrr I don't think the weth resets until tomorrow.  I still think it will be 225-250% combined though.
23,@NFTfi @BoredApeYC Can you add APR to the borrowers request?  It would help close loans quicker if we had a metric of what rate borrowers were looking for.
24,@LilMoonLambo @doodles @brian_armstrong @Coinbase_NFT Haha!  I rushed to check and see if it had sold.  You should serve a C&amp;D letter! 🤣
25,Hopefully this puts an end to the mint &amp; flip mania. https://t.co/pz8QudAUE3
26,"@OGDfarmer But kind sir, you are missing one."
27,@toddkramer1 @doodles @evankeast @poopie @burnttoast That better be coffee flavored 🤣😂
28,@nzt_eth @mattmpls33 @Mir_cleM_n @RDM_41 Nice analysis.  The chart makes it so much clearer.  I’m long term bullish on the site and love that they were built to give back.  Sold initial and waiting to see the rewards post drop.
29,"@Mir_cleM_n @RDM_41 They are indirectly tied to the Looks trading rewards.  With north of 90% of the volume being from wash sales, cutting the trading reward in half will cut the wash sales in half."
30,@NiftyReport Excellent read Dood!  So spot on.
31,@RDM_41 Not sure where the replies got their information.  The staking/trading rewards drop more than 50% at day 30 (3-4 days).  LP rewards are static for first 77 days.  Going to be a lot of surprised people when the weth rewards drop 50%!  https://t.co/d7g4heGyzR
32,@TrainerLuisCR As usual @EB7 beat me to the punch.  Big things coming from the @coffeedoods the next two months!
33,@notkyogai 2e by morning?  (Lovin that Kong!)
34,@notkyogai @RumbleKongs Wow bud!  Been making moves I see.  Congrats and welcome to the RKL!
35,@NFTfi Appreciate the prompt response.  Tried again and got it squared away!
36,@frugal_doodle @__chidz__ 2950! (Prolly already made since my Dood has been passed around a bit 🤣)
37,@ElliotOllieHad @doodles @marv_sun Welcome Welcome!
38,@NFTfi Tried joining discord but verified bot is down.  Please take a look.
39,@NFTfi @doodles @burnttoast Really interesting platform.  Is there a way to see recently created loans across the platform?  Would like to see more info on the rates/returns on specific collections/NFT's.
40,@RumbleKongsBot @RumbleKongs Free.
41,@Estiwz Your banner says it all…that Dood is en fuego!
42,@m00nsilly @doodles Not sure you could’ve picked a better one!  The purple and white is so clean.  Heard you’re a legend in the @doodles so welcome back.
43,@LilMoonLambo @doodles Wow!!!  Welcome to the community my friend!!  Such a cool Doodle!
44,@antibeinganti @doodles Haha!  She’ll love this!
45,@EB7 Seriously - wish my RKL bud would’ve told me about them sooner! 😒😏
46,@frugal_doodle @doodles They say things happen in 3’s...who’s buying the last coffee under 100!?
47,@mrmakerbot Wow!  Love the truck.
48,@sayinshallah We have one of each level and love it!  Even the quiet versions are a little loud though.
49,"OS Fee - 2.5%

50,@EB7 Just keep dropping these knowledge tidbits.  Learned so much from you over the past month.  Sooner or later I will start listening!
51,@MoosiePants @doodles How'd you know?!  She keeps sending photos from that site!
52,@communistspy @doodles Went over really well!  She's already updated her pfp's...and still expects the 💍 😂🤣
53,Gf wants a 💍…told her this was a much better investment 😂🤣.                @doodles https://t.co/GP3MQMXyMr
54,@IIIIIlIIIlIIlIl @doodles Twinning!
55,@Sirius1128_ @BoredMummyWU So clean - nice grab bud!
56,@liquiddensity I made that same decision earlier today!  The community is top notch and incredibly welcoming!
57,@RobbieHaben @doodles So you’re the one that stole that guy from me!  Guess I’ll just have to settle for my 2nd best!  Congrats!!!
58,@IIIIIlIIIlIIlIl @doodles I just jumped in earlier today! https://t.co/yjPlRlLLxX
59,"Broke the rules on afternoon coffee today!  Took me 3 weeks and 3 different owners to finally secure! 

Excited to finally be part of the @doodles fam!"
60,"@NathanHeadPhoto Can't believe this ""cutting edge"" community hasn't done this already.  Both BAYC and OS made over 500e each the past week alone on fees/royalties from the communities sales.  @RumbleKongs has started working on this weeks ago to protect the community!"
61,Absolutely spot on. https://t.co/8wBvf6Tsqe
62,"@christian777_s @LooksRareNFT At this point everyone is aware of what’s going on.  The team created a cool incentive to promote use of the site.  As usual, people found a way to exploit the incentive, killing the real purpose of it."
63,@christian777_s @LooksRareNFT Honest answer - yes.  They are being wash traded to earn the trading rewards.
64,@EB7 Can we please abolish prevent defenses now!?
65,@RektfulKen @BoredMummyWU LGF!
66,@LooksRareNFT These new features are literally brilliant...but can you guys dumb down for a minute and fix the most basic sorting function already?!
67,@MikeJonezEth @tokenfy_ 🤝
68,@Mezmon1 @MikeJonezEth @tokenfy_ Sup fellow Kong!  Saw the tokenomics on the site and was just confused when they sad initial supply.  Wasn't sure if there was a huge amount of dilution on the backside.
69,@MikeJonezEth @tokenfy_ Tokenomics showed 1B initial supply.  Is the max supply known?
70,@Kryptonometry Never following your shills again!  No bueno. https://t.co/vtdTUN0oQe
71,@LooksRareNFT @CapetainTrippy Curious - is token farming different than wash trading?
72,@EB7 @jenkinsthevalet Wen coffee!?
73,@CryptasticR @RumbleKongs Nice Hoodie!
74,@LooksRareNFT Is there a how to guide on the “sort by” feature?  Can’t seem to get it to work!
75,@LooksRareNFT ETA on “sort by” feature?  Dying to actually use your site…it’s just not usable yet!
76,@daniel100eth @Cheesindaily For 1/2 that you could become a top holder in a project that is building out 100 lands in The Sandbox.  @BoredMummyWU https://t.co/AtHBGxjjHh
77,@dingalingts @LooksRareNFT Please please please add the sort by price function ASAP.  I find the site completely unusable without it!
78,@BoredSpaceApe I've officially found my favorite BAYC of the entire collection.  That is a spectacular pfp!
79,@mongrelstine @opensea @BoredMummyWU @JerdleBMWU You got the beauty of the bunch!
80,"@JRNYcrypto Glad to have you as a top holder of EAR Club!  I’m heavy in one other project, @BoredMummyWU and our floor is still super low.  Free mint coming up and Sandbox land development nearly compete.  Come check it out!"
81,@toddkramer1 Anonymity will eventually destroy society.  Keep your head up bud...you are one of the last people this should have happened to.
82,@cesarcardenas94 @BoredMummyWU Lots of jealous mummies in our discord after that buy!  Nice snag and welcome!

87,@JasonDChen @BoredMummyWU @TheSandboxGame Stumbled across the mummies a couple months ago and haven’t been able to stop buying since! One of your fellow ape holders got me hooked on the space masks early on.  Just grabbed my 4th today!  Pleasure to meet a fellow mummy.
88,@JasonDChen @BoredMummyWU @TheSandboxGame Most Hype…Some Build…Few Deliver.  @BoredMummyWU just keep delivering.  Can’t wait to see my guys in @TheSandboxGame!! https://t.co/S03BFeP0mm
89,RT @RektfulKen: Just some @BoredMummyWU in @TheSandboxGame no big deal. Check it out in the alpha. 3 areas open to the public. These mummie…
90,@Rager The gains have already been made on those projects!  I would jump into smaller cutting edge projects.  Preferably ones like @BoredMummyWU which have been building in the sandbox for months and are nearly ready!   #sandbox https://t.co/GsI2dTEMol
91,@yelownft @BoredMummyWU Can I steal the pfp too?!
