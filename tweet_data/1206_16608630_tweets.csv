everyone will process differently and everyone has different ability to support.

do what you can, where you can, for who you can. it is enough to just love."

65,"just wanna voice some (rare) support for @CryptTV 

this team has 3+ million subscribers on @YouTube and has made very little money from their work. the main benefactor of their creation has been the platform they host it on

70,"also if everybody builds something together instead of trying to focus only on their own success, the rewards are much bigger

working in a group = more fun, more fulfilling, more ethical, and more funds

am i a DAO simp now??????? uhoh"
71,"like imagine if the lens you used to view your participation on the internet wasn't ""ok so how will i get more followers today""

and instead it was ""how can we show everyone how cool &amp; welcoming &amp; smart our group is""

a lot of pressure off your back as an individual. &amp; more fun!"

74,"if you've been feeling alone as a creator, joining &amp; participating in a DAO might give you the sense of belonging &amp; contributing to something greater than yourself that you've been looking for

you don't have to do it alone anymore"
75,"DAOs are such a paradigm shift in internet culture

we've all been building our own digital brands across social media. and we've been doing it *alone* for so long.

but contributing to a DAO completely shifts your focus &amp; intent from ""me"" to ""we"""
