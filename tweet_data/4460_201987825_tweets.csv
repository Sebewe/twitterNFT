0,"@0xBender It's not a long thread bud. I'm going back to ""I rarely trust doxxed teams"" doesn't really make logical sense and is not a good look for an anon NFT influencer. Care to share why you decided to go anon?"
1,"@0xBender That's exactly why you shouldn't have made the statement saying that you rarely trust doxxed teams, just doesn't follow"
2,"@0xBender If anything, after beanie, everyone should be much more suspicious of anon NFT influencers/teams. Why did you decide to go anon?"
3,"@0xBender I did, just don't agree with rarely trusting doxxed teams. You could have maid your point without that statement, which makes it sound like teams who choose to dox shouldn't be trusted and should be an immediate red flag."
4,"@0xBender Oof. ""I rarely trust doxxed teams"" is not a good look for an anon influencer in the NFT space."
5,@shitc0in Hungry for followers much?
6,@laurashin Awesome. Keep up the great work!
7,"@AC676_nft @dragonseller88 Hahaha, good one"
8,@KlimaDAO Would be nice if we could lower APY to a point where we don't need to keep lowering it for a several months.
9,@beaniemaxi What a grifter. Ppl only follow to see the disgraced spectacle you so obviously are.
10,@wolfdotgame All proceeds go to @beaniemaxi legal fund..
11,@snullebobini @Zg42_21 Then why even have a token? The promise of staking and yield is what attracts investors. They dropped 12% of $looks to influencers and treasury+team got 20% of total supply. How else were they gonna pump their bags?
12,@Leonardosan33 @hodlmao @KlimaDAO I figure. But still much better than original logo.
13,"@snullebobini @Zg42_21 Not saying they aren't building. Just that it wasn't a good investment based on how they did their airdrop and the promise of yield for staking their (still) overvalued token. One day it could be a good investment, but that day hasn't come yet."
14,@0xBender It was pretty obvious what @LooksRareNFT was doing by recruiting influencers with airdrop to drive hype for staking.
15,"@0xBender Didn't you pump the project like everyone else tho? 

https://t.co/agF9SguuYm"
16,@Zg42_21 It was so obvious $looks only cared about recruiting influencers and whales to hype the project with their airdrop. Everyone should have expected price to tank after so many were convinced to buy and stake.
17,"very sus indeed, especially after @neotokyonewstv and @SuperFarmDAO. How many more mints and token launches it gonna take to actually do something? https://t.co/4y2O1rxciS"
18,"@KlimaDAO Great article, but couldn't find Easter egg. Very bullish on the klima mission, products, and partnerships!"
19,@hodlmao @KlimaDAO Way better logo than @KlimaDAO !
20,"@elliotrades Not surprised, content has been down hill for a while"
21,@Zeneca_33 The great migration really started during defi summer
22,Community should organize a @KlimaDAO carbon bonding event for earth day (4/22)
23,Very slick https://t.co/imDctR1BFS
24,"@iamDCinvestor Honestly don't know if you're being serious. If you promoted a project without disclosing compensation, there's no excuse for that. If not, stop trying to be funny and confusing ppl. Either way, not a great look."
25,@AltcoinDailyio Sauce?
26,"RT @FTX_Official: The next ₿ig thing is here, even if Larry can’t see it.

We’re giving away 7.54 #bitcoin right now to celebrate! 

How to…"
27,"@bitdaddytezza @AltcoinDailyio ""average Joe"" doesn't have $23M lying around for NFTs lol"
28,@wolfdotgame This is just nonsensical garbage pumping beanie's bags
29,"@BlockGeekDima Perhaps, but not ones that have been articulated by language thus far."
30,@BlockGeekDima Maybe some experiences/feelings had while tripping that can't be described with words?
31,@scottmelker gm. Have fun on vaca!
32,@CozomoMedici Sounds desperate
33,@LuisTrends2017 @JRNYcrypto @ZssBecker Got em!
34,@farokh Why do you need a coin?
35,"@TrustlessState Minimum balance, # of transactions, number of dapps used, disqualify wallets that are linked to 5+ other qualifying wallets. Transaction volume should only be a small factor, if at all."
36,@TrustlessState You got a lot of sweeping to do.. https://t.co/dzvbjXIOJt
37,"RT @CreolControl: Hey @KlimaDAO , wanted to show you guys something we are working on for KI https://t.co/nwU6QPmFnt"
38,"@Viri38734389 @KlimaDAO Technically, people investing now have the best opportunity to capture the biggest share of market than anyone before us. The project started at like $1B market cap. I'd rather buy now when mc is low."
39,@sassal0x Not even close
40,@KlimaDAO https://t.co/ea1KM60GQH
41,@azfnft Implosion imminent..
42,@JaeSCardenas @Doms_Crypto @scottmelker Max pain is that pfp
43,@farokh @ParisHilton @OriginProtocol @superplastic Seems like a money grab
44,@LooksRareNFT How much it cost to wash trade?
45,@jebus911 Sounds like a money grab
46,@diamondhandsKM Gotta echo @LeoDiCaprio as obvious choice for @KlimaDAO
47,@Jeff_M_Mastro @ReeseW Nice try @brian_armstrong.. hehe
48,@ReeseW @KlimaDAO is what your looking for
49,@KlimaDAO @ReeseW Crushing it
50,@ASvanevik Coinbase launching things usually marks the top
51,@GodsUnchained @AltcoinDailyio @Immutable What ever happened to the rest of the airdrop? Only got the first of 3.
52,@elliotrades You actually gonna deliver on this NFT game you keep raving about?
53,@TheStalwart @jebus911 @KlimaDAO
54,This will remove possibily the biggest barrier to adoption for @KlimaDAO. Like building a tunnel through a mountain! https://t.co/NcyIZ7lwqO
55,@NFTethics We need more of this investigatory work in the space.
56,@EnnAye10 @BennettReib All of the above
57,@Knuckl3z__ @BRYTE_APE @LooksRareNFT Top
58,@bdznft @LooksRareNFT Top signal
59,"@0xAllen_ Lol, tho can't take any figures at face value when so much of it could be wash.."
60,@0xAllen_ @serglotz Agreed.
61,"@BTC_Archive 200B in crypto, not just BTC"
62,Bout time we got rid of this swindler https://t.co/uDQOcQlTYL
63,@TheCryptoLark Show proof it's not a wash trade or don't post it
64,Props to @mcuban for being so early in realizing @KlimaDAO potential impact and incentive structure. https://t.co/BM2EXHsgUJ
65,@mooncat2878 @LooksRareNFT Pump before the dump
66,"@BlockFiSupport You have one job to pay out interest, that you only do once a month. How did you mess this up??"
67,"@lapis_gaetano @tokenfy_ Not about ""my time"", it's about the direction the space is headed and the blatant rich get richer schemes to attract influencers that leaves the avg person behind."
68,"@seedphrase That's a nice thought, but I'd say web3 is more about digital property rights."
69,If you spent less than 3 ETH on OS you can expect to get between $1-$4 worth of $TKNFY. Not even worth the gas to claim. Just another airdrop exclusively for the richest members of the NFT community.
70,Yet another vampire attack airdrop almost exclusively for the richest members of the NFT community. Seems @tokenfy_ only cares about lining the pockets of NFT influencers in hopes they bring their wash trades and convince their followers of staking incentives. This is not the way https://t.co/wrebTfvKBU
71,@DiscoverXnft @LooksRareNFT How can anyone believe this is a legitimate sale and not just wash trading to pump up price?
72,@jebus911 Terrible advice in general
73,"@NicLazTweets @NFTethics @3thirty3tv More facts, not info"
74,"@Brownmgold @GoldmanSachs @BoredApeYC If you didn't think that high value pfp NFTs were being used to scam ppl before, Goldman Sachs just bought a @BoredApeYC"
75,"@NicLazTweets @NFTethics They are just presenting facts, everybody has to make their own decision. More facts the better imo"
76,@printer_brrr @NFTethics This is a brilliant idea and would be much appreciated by your followers.
77,RT @NFTethics: 1/3 These large Twitter accounts are all part of the same (invisible) cartel involved in scamming people by promoting rugs.…
78,@NFTethics Can't trust BAYC or cryptopunks pfps anymore. Seems like their main use case is to help scam ppl
79,"RT @NFTethics: 1/2 - Dear @andy8052, as the founder and CEO of @fractional_art, we noticed that Beanie/GM Capital claims to be an investor…"
80,@econoar Wash trading
81,@LooksRareNFT Maybe it's just too many wash trades?
82,@ArchimedesCryp1 @KlimaDAO @atmosfearful More than the leak we already got?
83,@_WonderlandG How can anyone trust this now?
84,"@0xBender aka, @beaniemaxi, @danielesesta, @0xSifu, etc.."
85,@mooncat2878 @LooksRareNFT You not seeing all the reports about how it's pretty much all wash trading on the platform? $LOOKS is a powder keg. Take profits while you can.
86,@DiscoverXnft Someone had to say it
87,"Nobody should be surprised by this. $LOOKS

https://t.co/ZY8AoO320i"
88,@OmiXRPSilverFan @FranckRoccaOff @NathanHeadPhoto this is exactly why it likely won't end well for most
89,@NathanHeadPhoto So many toppy $LOOKS tweets..
90,@Zeneca_33 Kinda how I'm starting to feel about ppl talking about BAYC in general

95,@ToucanProtocol @CarbonizedNFT @PoriniFoundatio @market_xyz @QiDaoProtocol Why not cite @KlimaDAO ?
