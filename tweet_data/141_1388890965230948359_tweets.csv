11,"@cryptoflarb That's true but people will call projects scams just because of a decision they don't like or because the price drops. 

If something isn't living up to your expectations, that doesn't instantly make it a scam or mean that the team has been dishonest"

Painful stuff but dwelling on it won't help anyone. Better to keep working on creating value in my spare time until it pays off 💪"
44,@Zeneca_33 Opted to use it as a lottery ticket to recover instead. Recently sold a token for a small profit expecting a dip and instead it carried on flying to the point I would have been able to cash out and pay everything off. Then I rushed into something emotionally and took a big loss.
45,"@Zeneca_33 Read this one multiple times, always hits. I'm in a decent amount of debt due to unexpected costs over the last few months. Decided not to sell my crypto as it's only a small amount and wouldn't make much difference to my situation. 1/3"

71,"Well, $LOOKS like I sold too early again..."
72,"Learning to be comfortable sitting on liquid ETH and not feeling like you need to ape straight into the next thing is important.
