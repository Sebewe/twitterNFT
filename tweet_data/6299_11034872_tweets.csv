1,@joerunshome @zed_run Congrats!
2,@jjonlee @LinusCaldwell5 @cortez_crypto The real question is why would a user intentionally keep entering races they expect to lose. Ignoring tanking - is this the product experience you want or expect a user to go through?
3,@bg_alt @CeeJLive1 @knowyourhorses Oh. Well you could have led with that 😂
4,@bg_alt @CeeJLive1 @knowyourhorses Just because it doesn't match the guide doesn't mean it wasn't intentional though
5,@CeeJLive1 @bg_alt @knowyourhorses Yeah I'm thinking this may be the case
6,@bg_alt You take your best practices and get out of here. Don't you know that a startup has 5 full years of leeway before they need to start building out unit tests?
7,@danks_eth @AlexStemplewski @Piggies_NFT When you say doxxed team - where is that? I just see two pseudonyms on the site
8,"@roidragerracing @jjonlee @pac_racing @RacingGlue Yeah, if we're going to effectively set the breed date for 100k horses to be the same, we should make all horses have the same reset date"

20,@hiheyimalex it's no longer possible to see when a horse's breed cycle refreshes from mobile. It looks like the breed information modal pops under the main breeding modal. Wondering if the same thing is happening on the horse detail page - the i icon seems to do nothing there https://t.co/EuZFvAQV4c

44,"@donkeykongdad0 @Lamps08dfs Love the idea of being able to only accept the highest bid. If someone wants to pay .2 to breed with a stud, the owner shouldn't be able to accept a .07 bid"
45,"@donkeykongdad0 @jjonlee @ArbitrageRacin @alhambren @Spotonparts @knowyourhorses Agreed that private breeding is probably not the best direction. If you want to breed privately in the current system, all you have to do is set your stud priced high enough for the market to pass on using it. Making it easier to breed privately for cheaper hurts small stables"
