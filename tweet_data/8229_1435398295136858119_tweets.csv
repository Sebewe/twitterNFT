20,"So I'll just conclude with the ""most important"" takeaway from all this, which I haven't shared yet.  (Okay, I've beat that joke into the ground at this point.)  Peace and love."
21,"If the market is an indicator, as of this writing, there are only five UFOs listed for sale on OpenSea (in a 10k collection): 
https://t.co/J3BqupIA2B"
22,"In any event, The response from the community was an outpouring of understanding.  I already loved the @punkscape community, but moments like these really warm my heart. 😍  I think the key ""most important"" lesson here is be honest, open, and transparent with your community."
23,"In other words, we issued a moratorium (in the interests of fairness) on trading of what would become UFOs by team members until the information was made public to the community."
24,Here's another tip from a policy we implemented:  we allow our team members to buy and sell Scapes. We believe it aligns interests.  But we made an exception for this particular trait during the window when we had knowledge a change was coming that the community didn't yet know.
25,"Planning ahead meant we had time to consider and iterate on various options for replacement art.  We were, nonetheless, nervous how the community would react to the change."
26,"At @PunkScape, for example, we wanted to replace the potentially infringing material with something we believe in (we went with UFOs) and we wanted the rarity scores of the collection to be identical to before the change. https://t.co/A7jCsyakbo"
27,"The second and even more ""most important"" thing you can do is communicate the situation with your holders and what you intend to do about it.  Planning ahead means you have more opportunity on the ""what you intend to do"" front and aren't blindsided by a DMCA notice."
28,But people also want their NFTs freely tradable on the major marketplaces.  Take your time with the decision to lock the metadata.  Giving yourself a window to address potential issues benefits the project.
29,"The first and most important thing you can do is start planning for it.  In our case, we had the benefit of the decision to delay locking the metadata.  And I get it, locking metadata is appealing.  People want their NFTs ""immutable."""
30,"So what can you do if you're an NFT project that has elements that potentially put you at risk?  We recently went through this with @PunkScape and I wanted to share some lessons from that experience:
https://t.co/TJMxDRg23t"
31,"On that topic, incidentally, I highly recommend the esteemed Professor Lawrence Lessig.  He's amazing. (14-year-old video, but still timely.)
https://t.co/0xgskUCmtx"
32,"If this dynamic makes you upset, I would suggest that your beef is not with whoever sent a DMCA, nor is it with @opensea, it's really with our legal framework around copyright law."
33,"If your gut response is, ""everybody does it,"" keep in mind that's not a legal defense. https://t.co/pZfkvdmuik"
34,But NFT creators should understand when they reference copywritten work they assume a major risk.  Same goes for buyers of NFTs when buying into a project with assets that incorporate copywritten material.
35,"With respect to @cryptomories, I don't know the details as to who sent the takedown notice, and I'm not going to comment on who is in the right, legally, with respect to the particular claim.  I simply don't have enough information to form an opinion. https://t.co/OCiZLqLi6U"
36,"In the NFT space, delisting from OpenSea, while not a death sentence to a project, is often a catastrophic blow.  The marketplaces for NFTs are not particularly decentralized--though that's changing, with the arrival of alternative marketplaces like @LooksRareNFT,@the_x2y2, etc."
37,"As a practical matter, this means entities often simply comply and take down the potentially infringing material.  Ask a lawyer to choose between potential liability for their client and no potential liability for their client, and guess which they'll tend to pick."
38,"The way a DMCA notice works, once a website receives it (in this case OS), they have to make a decision whether to take down the material or not.  If they choose the latter, they open themselves up for potential secondary liability for assisting with copyright infringement."
39,"Recently, @CryptoMories was delisted from OpenSea after a DMCA takedown notice.  @PunkScape also recently made a change to a trait due to IP concerns.  Some thoughts on intellectual property and NFTs: 🧵"

49,"I have no doubt most projects are honorable and wouldn't swap rares around post-mint/pre-reveal, but ""trustlessness"" is an important ethos of Web 3 and there's no reason projects can't get this right."
50,"This is old news of course, PunkScape minted five months ago, but I'm bringing this up because we're *still* seeing new projects fail to provide mechanisms to ensure a fair mint."
51,"In the @PunkScape mint contract, each token was assigned randomly (with the randomization script IN the contract). https://t.co/cVuXsxpldA"
52,"""Okay,"" you say, ""but that's still not a perfectly fair mint because the project would know which IDs contain rares and therefore could try to time their own mint when those IDs are coming up.""  @PunkScape had an answer for that too..."
53,"For example:  when @punkscape minted, @jwahdatehagh put the provenance hash of the complete set immutably in the contract.  Once the mint completed, anyone could compare the provenance hash of the complete metadata file and see that it matched (hence no shenanigans)."
54,"What is to stop a project, in other words, from doing their mint, and in the phase before reveal, swapping around metadata and artwork so that selected wallets obtain the rarest of the collection?  This actually isn't hard to solve and some projects handle this properly."
55,"Thought I'd share a small gripe about the way so many (so many!) NFT projects mint:  Many generative collections mint (with various rares in the collection), reveal sometime later, and fail to take steps to ensure that the rares are actually randomly assigned.  🧵"

62,"I want to emphasize that we did not make this decision lightly.  We've debated the pros and cons for five months.  We understand that not everyone will be happy with this change, but we believe it's the right thing for @punkscape over the long haul."
63,"Moreover, even if a lawsuit never happens, the threat of a lawsuit can -itself- interfere with potential opportunities and deals.  Many entities and individuals may opt to keep away rather than take on the risk."
64,"The more relevant question is:  how confident are we that providing licensing rights keeps PunkScape and its holders from becoming mired in potential legal battles?  When you're sued, even when you win, you very often lose from the perspective of time, energy, and cost."
65,"Some of the more legal-minded among you may be immediately thinking, aren't the Bow Ships fair use?  (Or, for those in the UK, fair dealing?)  Isn't the work transformative?  And, for what it's worth, we agree with you!  But these aren't the questions that guided this decision."
66,"This thread is not to discuss the full details of that licensing model, but simply to note that the ""Bow Ships,"" in particular, posed an obstacle.  In other words, are we, as a project, comfortable telling holders they have full merchandising rights to PunkScapes?"
67,"Some relevant background: @PunkScape intends to launch an ""owner decides"" licensing model for the Scapes, allowing some Scapes to be in the public domain, others to be more restricted, with the decision (and accompanying rights) resting with the holder."
68,"The @punkscape team recently implemented a decision that was discussed for months: to change the artwork for a particular trait we called ""bow ships"" to UFOs.  This thread provides what led to that decision. 🧵 https://t.co/BooSBLlU8A"

96,"When I mentioned earlier maybe they were headed toward a theory of strict liability, I was thinking Product Liability, incidentally.  I think the case could be framed as a product liability case and the ""failure to warn"" hints at that."
97,"To my eye, they really didn't plead the basic elements of a contract case.  (Most notably, the existence of a contract, express or implied, between the parties.)"
98,"Just took a look at the civil case cover sheet as well.  This isn't binding on the claims in the same way the complaint is, but it's interesting they characterized it as a contract case. https://t.co/ZtgubQhrj9"
