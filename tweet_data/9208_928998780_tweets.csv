0,@ToppsNFTs @Topps @opensea Topps has zero clue what they are doing and they have consistently shown they care zero percent about community. This is like their 4th attempt at a new platform in a year…need to either abandon NFTs all together or hire someone new to run the NFT department cause this is silly.

9,@NiftyNiles @nairb621 @farokh Seems like a decent hedge really.  If the project doesn’t do well you can argue you paid well over market for charity purposes and the price did not reflect true current value at sale.  If the project goes on to do well you have the rarest NFT in the collection 😂
10,@nairb621 @farokh You should be eligible for a tax deduction if you can prove the funds went to charity.

17,@DAYINFLICTOR @CinderNFT I thought the team handled everything prior to the drop well and kept the community informed and engaged. The minting process was smooth and they sold out.

48,@DN8collector lol why you gotta flex that Alien and Murakami DNA like that??!
49,@theycallmeshwaz @MoonOverlord @ap3father I own both and got into Azuki's as I had that same feeling I got when I first saw Apes. I do think rapid increases in price should also come with caution but 15ETH just honestly isn't that much anymore.  3-5 ETH in June 21' is comparable to a 10-15ETH floor now.

52,"@M4ke_Nit_Rain @brycent_ @veefriends I agree, VeeFriends is definitely a blue chip and I think currently undervalued at the current price."
53,@brycent_ High end blue chip that could possibly run big would be CryptoPunks.  Mid Tier with known utility would be Clonex and Cool Cats.  Possible unicorns could be Azuki and Pixel Vault ecosystem.  Outlier is Doodles.  Obviously BAYC ecosystem but that will cost $$.

90,"@HOFbarrybonds25 @Gee__Gazza @tropoFarmer @akeemakway Huh? That’s the whole point…it’s only ridiculous to those who don’t have 500 mil.  Floyd can pay as much for any premium item he wants cause money isn’t an issue.  NFTs, Haircuts or whatever can be purchased according to what ppl are willing to pay to get what they want."
91,"@Gee__Gazza @tropoFarmer This actually seems more ridiculous than overpaying for an NFT.  😂🤣

""Floyd Mayweather Reportedly Spends More Than $10K on Haircuts Every Month""

https://t.co/FYqVGtSbeH"
92,"@Gee__Gazza @tropoFarmer Yeah, but with that being said, if money wasn't an issue at all  I would just get whatever one I wanted and related to the most, regardless of price.  Cause at that point, who cares, just gotta go with what you vibe with and makes you happy."
93,@Gee__Gazza @tropoFarmer I would have aggressively gone after my specific Ape at this point if I wasn't the owner and paid well over whatever floor price WW2 helmets or Aloha shirts are.  I'm a pilot and living in Hawaii so it makes sense to me  to get what I relate to most.  500 is a lot tho.
