33,"@Alts_Anonymous @altstatemachine @RTFKTstudios I would kind of find that a shame tbh. ASM brains are compatible with any NFT and their team is the best in that sector, so if RTFKT go for a copycat version themselves, that to me goes against what the open metaverse is all about. I want to see RTFKT stick to their strengths 💪"

73,"10. Gold and silver FLUFs

Last but not least, the rarest, most desirable and simply the creme de la creme 🍝of FLUF World🥇🥈 Taking the spotlight has to be Cleopatra who was recently sold for a record 250 ETH!!! 🏆🤯 now owned by the legend himself @MaxStealth5 https://t.co/qnIroRgvNY"
74,"9. Demon masks

One of the coolest and most distinctive looking traits  is the demon mask with only 33 in the collection. These look extra sick when paired with rare eyes. I wonder what special utility they may get down the line 👺🤔 cc: @crypto_navi https://t.co/W1HdLFGD3P"
75,"8. The Zombie King and Queen

Talking of FLUF royalty... there is only 1 male and 1 female FLUF with crowns in the collection. Will they end up breeding to produce little zombie Heirs to the throne? 👀👑 https://t.co/OTQFT7uP5L"
76,"7. Famous FLUFs

Sometimes the lore becomes legend. A FLUF which needs no introduction. Meet Blossom, the Queen of the FLUFs, owned by the Blossom King himself: @knuxponential https://t.co/RQvMotLqcH"
77,"6. Rare furs

The FLUF's that everyone are talking about, but few can afford. There are simply too many stunners to mention but for my favourites I will go for this Holographic Fur (15 total) with coloured curly fry afro!🍟 and VIP Hirst🎨 cc: @MaxStealth5  @robbyvcrypto https://t.co/TMPhmQ1Xbd"
78,"5. Ballers

Similar theme to above but trait combinations of FLUFs who have a taste for the finer things in life💸 🤑 Did you know, there is only 1 FLUF in the whole collection with the gold jacket and cap combo? cc: @ThePursuit7 https://t.co/ZmK9KhOWRE"
79,"4. Combos

Sometimes these don't get the recognition that they deserve. Trait combinations that make them much rarer than their rarity scores imply! Find some of my favourite combos below!

cc: @maxpoker247 @TRZpoker @nftsales https://t.co/Kv8lyklf9E"
80,"3. POTA Lanyard

The rarest trait in the collection outside of those on the silver/gold FLUFs, with only 5 in existence. An ode to the OG Non-fungible labs NFT project. Below is an absolute stunner with the Kanagawa fur and Portal eyes combo looking absolutely incredible 😍 https://t.co/wFqkQMcyFb"
81,"2. Aesthetic FLUFs

I'll let the photo do the talking itself, for me the cleanest FLUF in the whole collection and one which suits the mansion background so well. Simply perfect 👌 https://t.co/gFWY4As68h"
82,"1. FLUFs with amazing lore

@FLUF_World has created amazing lore from the very beginning, and FLUF owners are able to change their FLUF's name and description for free to build on the story!

One of my favourite examples is the (in)famous Bunny Binion cc: @BunnyBinion  Wen FSOP? https://t.co/HnfhEhXCkQ"
83,"Ok so I'm going to try something slightly different for my #THISISFLUFWORLD MEGATHREAD! 🐰🌎🎉🥳🙌
