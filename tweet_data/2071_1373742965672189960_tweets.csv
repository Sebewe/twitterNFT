18,"2/3 Getting older I’ve learned, it’s Depression. It’s been around most of my life, all of my life. Last few decades I’ve been relatively free, based on specific things I do: sunshine, nature, prayer, meditation, talking, moving, even when I don’t feel like it. This works for me."
19,"1/3 This is a Public Service Announcement…with ART!!! #wip I beat myself up at times. Just now coming out of a recent, low-grade depression. Saying it here, not for sympathy, but for anyone else feeling Depressed or off. When I was younger I used to call it “being in a Funk.” https://t.co/rGjxkMnLsC"
