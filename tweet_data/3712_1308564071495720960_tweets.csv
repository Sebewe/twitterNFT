31,"@the_x2y2 is there a reason NFT listing rewards changed to 0 all of a sudden? Collections still doing volume, prices not raised or anything like that.

Would be better if this process wasn't so opaque. Still multiple collections with greater volume aren't counted. #NFTs https://t.co/JHzt0g4w8e"

93,"@PublicMistake @Jorgeschneide64 @tokenstate Is it possible Russia's military could be driven by more factors than just the US president? Asking ironically because the answer is clear. Political science is complicated, anyone who thinks world affairs are obvious and ""not rocket science"" unequivocally knows jack shit"
94,"@tokenstate Sir you are assuming the current us president would change how Putin behaves. There could be an enormous number of factors influencing Putin's choices many of which we don't know.

You cannot seriously believe Putin respects or fears Trump."
95,@DatCryptoBoi Agree that it’s a risky time to use high leverage. Market too volatile
96,@iamDCinvestor Fair question. People should consider if what they have in NFTs is value they can afford to lose if things don’t go as they plan. An important consideration.
97,@gainzxbt To be fair what would you have Biden do? You want US forces involved? I mean there are not a lot of great short term options.
98,"@Pentosh1 @undercoverBobo So would you say you drank the fed breast milk? I mean what is this childish hypocrisy, you can’t even reach the man’s second thought without a contradiction"
99,"@Pentosh1 Who’s hoping? Reasoning they might do something is logic and discussion, not hope.

The fed impacts everything but is not the reason or driver for my long term investments

My suggestion is to not take things so personally and insult people if you want to be taken seriously"
