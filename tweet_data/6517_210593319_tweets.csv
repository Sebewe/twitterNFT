1,RT @Cooopahtroopa: Music NFTs are on the cusp of their viral moment.
2,"@KRP_eth Thanks my man, there’s so many things I’d change about my mixes but ‘done is better than perfect’ is my mantra nowadays - good ears bro ✊🏽"
3,"@KRP_eth Likewise KRP, I’m SAGRADO 🧘🏽‍♂️"
4,"@HOUNDTRACK No doubt, he’s doing some seriously important work"
5,"@YWG30 I wasted years of my life trying to live completely off my music, then I realized it’s more important to maintain security &amp; freedom to then create music from a place of peace, not urgency. 

It changed everything.
Sending you love &amp; support ✊🏽"
6,"@YWG30 I understand, I don’t want to downplay anyone’s struggles/situation but from my experience, putting that much pressure on your music can be very detrimental - play the long game &amp; be patient. Create because you love it, not because it makes you money"
7,"@Aeromist So I have my own opinions about curated platforms but regardless of what I believe, I understand. It’s their platform &amp; they can run it however they see fit."
8,"@nickunj_ladani @Cooopahtroopa tough question, I’m a fan of so many artists right now but @mintsongs is a great place to shop around - the best music NFT is the one you love to listen to"
9,"@YWG30 Your time will come, don’t worry about when"
10,@KRP_eth @Cooopahtroopa 100% agree ✊🏽
11,"@JSTechThing I think this would help distribute the power of curation to the artists/contributors of the platform and create a dope, diverse network effect"

I wish to be half as good at my craft as my Dad is at his.

I do this work to fund my dream of living off my music - he does this work to fulfill his dream of moving back to México con mi abuelita.

I’m proud of the both of us. https://t.co/NSwJG0hkG7"

70,"@thebalanceking Love it! I think that’s the key (lol) “it can grow and change over time” just like artists do - it’s like having a front row seat to an artist’s journey. The music should be the foundation of the relationship, everything else is extra imo."
