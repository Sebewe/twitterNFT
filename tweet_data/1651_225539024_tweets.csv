1,@realhumankinder @proof_xyz Minted the same one. Such a relief after 4 days of torture.
2,@XXHeartYou Looking forward to it!! So stunning! Marc Jacobs for LV is a distant second to this.
3,"@XXHeartYou These look sick!! Also, what’s the story behind HeartYou LV bags? Can people get one?"
4,@AmitMukherjee Will be watching it tonight. Thank you for the recommendation. Have you seen CODA? My personal favorite among Oscar 2022 nominees.

16,"@KIcabales Thank you, Kevin. Glad it was helpful."
17,"@0xrDan I think these are 3 distinct ways of self expression. Every artist’s choice and collector’s preference is unique. As for what’s more scarce/valuable, it’s not straightforward either. E.g. the floor on Twin Flames is higher than any 1/1 out there. All unique cases."

39,"Lessons from top 5 photography NFT editions:

1. Engage your community
2. Reward your biggest patrons
3. Connect with your supporters
4. Include perks
5. Create scarcity

When done thoughtfully, editions are highly effective at elevating and strengthening your brand. https://t.co/FZzMAE9JRk"
40,"5/ Create scarcity

When @JordHammond minted Hakuna Matata, he considered burning the unsold editions to increase the value for those who'd already supported him.

Very thoughtful.

In the end, all editions were minted, so the burn never happened. https://t.co/SGN5IZuvVj"
41,"4/ Include perks

Great Escape is the foundation of everything @erubes1 would create in 2022.

From access to one of the most vibrant photography Discord groups to priority list for his future drops.

At 0.15 ETH, Great Escape is a bargain for the amount of value one can obtain. https://t.co/du4gakRxhm"
42,"3/ Connect with your supporters

@GuidoDisalle is one of the most engaged artists in the space.

From dozens of Spaces ahead of the drop, to personal invites to his supporters, to live conversations with his models.

For a week, Sending My Love was among top 5 photography series. https://t.co/AfKpD9kxgk"
43,"2/ Reward your biggest patrons

@Reuben_Wu whose 1/1s have sold for 25+ ETH knew there would be an overwhelming demand for his editions, and so he ran a limited reserve list for friends and existing collectors.

Price of The Vanishing has more than 2X'ed since the mint. https://t.co/ivtWIj3IAp"
44,"1/ Engage your community

@cathsimard_ let her community decide which of her photographs they wanted to see editioned.

She picked 4 images and had people vote for the one they loved the most. 

It was a close vote, but in the end the majority chose Trillion Star Hotel. https://t.co/NLM4IUgsTV"
45,"Editions are an effective tool for photographers to expand and strengthen their communities.

I researched top 5 photography NFT editions and spoke to two dozen collectors to learn what made these works so successful. 

Here are the five things I learned 👇"
46,"@pixelpete @justinaversano Justin truly makes the dreams come true, doesn’t he?"
47,"@justinaversano @fellowshiptrust @pixelpete @zak_krevitt @MattDoogue QM! Thank you for your leadership, Justin!

If you enjoyed the story, please retweet it. You never know whom it might inspire.

I'll be writing more threads about photographers pushing forward the NFT space. 

Follow me. Let's learn together."
59,"I was inspired by @DrifterShoots's story and highly recommend listening to it on @dave_krugman's podcast.

Lessons I took away:

• Don't lose faith
• Every obstacle is there to help you get to next level
• Keep fighting
• Be grateful
• Pay it forward

60,"Isaac is determined to help others carve out their place in the world.

As Where My Vans Go ascends to new highs, Isaac is building a non-profit to support those falsely accused and push for prison abolition.

His vision is a world centered around forgiveness and rehabilitation."
61,"Where My Vans Go was later expanded and today consists of 117 photos.

Jaw dropping images tell an inspiring story of courage, resilience and faith, calling to action, and inviting to follow your dreams.

The floor sits at 44 ETH making it the 2nd most valuable NFT collection. https://t.co/5iS3lgZsUG"
62,"I'm amazed by Isaac's gratefulness and generosity.

Here's a man, who 4 months earlier almost got a life sentence, supporting other artists, spending his hard-earned ETH buying their work.

Isaac also paid off his Mom’s mortgage and took care of his best friends."
63,"Where My Vans Go launched on August 7.

50 photographs priced at 0.25 ETH sold out in 8 minutes, but the best part was yet to come.

The collection quickly rose to the top of the charts as people were reselling pieces for 2, 5, 10 ETH. 

Two weeks later, #9 was resold for 46 ETH. https://t.co/vIf4lIi3BI"
64,"The image sold in one week.

Isaac minted 8 more and was later accepted to @SuperRare. It didn't take long for the right collectors to appreciate Isaac's unique take on urban exploring and resonate with his story.

With all pieces sold, Isaac began working on a special project."
65,"While Isaac was prison fighting for his life, the world was taken over by NFTs.

With no savings and legal bills exceeding $250,000, Isaac saw an opportunity to not only solve his financial situation, but also share his story.

Isaac minted his first piece on @withFND on 23 Apr. https://t.co/BniO9dnjzA"
66,"Four months in prison deepened Isaac's appreciation for life.

""I could’ve been dead, but I wasn’t. Forget thriving. I was just trying to survive. If the world put me through this, there’s gotta be a reason.""

Belief in a higher purpose got Isaac through those difficult months."
67,"Isaac spent the next 2 months in prison.

Lawyers finally lowered the bond to $10,000. Isaac got out, but almost immediately found himself back in prison. Got out. Got arrested again.

Dragged through 3 more courts, Isaac was released for good in April.
https://t.co/9WW9I4UH5g"
68,"2 months later, Isaac was extradited to Cincinnati, his hometown.

The bail was set at $400,000, beyond Isaac's means. Prosecuted in multiple states, he was told that he would never get out of prison.

Isaac knew he was going to have to fight for his life."
69,"• Trespassing
• Kidnapping
• Evading the police
• Armed robbery
• Burglary

List of charges made Isaac look like Jason Bourne leaving him completely speechless. There wasn't a bit of factual information. 

He was taken to jail and spent the next 2 months in 23-hour lockdown."
70,"A moment later, 20 police officers swarmed in with dogs and assault rifles.

They ordered Isaac out of the car, forced him to lay down on the ground with his hands outstretched, and put guns to the back of his head.

His camera gear, memory cards and laptop were ceased."
71,"On 17 Dec 2020, Isaac was driving to Vegas for a product shoot.

Suddenly traffic stopped. State trooper cars blocked the highway. Helicopters were circling overhead. Unaware of what was going, Isaac just sat in the car in the middle of that chaos.

Then suddenly it got quiet."
72,"Seeing the world from entirely new perspectives was lifesaving.

Wanting to share the awe he felt, Isaac picked up a camera and made most daring photographs and began posting them on IG under a pseudonym.

But what Isaac saw as transformative the authorities viewed as criminal."
73,"Struggling with PTSD after leaving the army in 2018, Isaac Wright (aka @DrifterShoots) found an escape in urban exploring.

Summiting skyscrapers, construction sites, and bridges (his favorite) was better than therapy.

Death-defying climbs gave Isaac sense of calm like no other."
74,"@DrifterShoots was locked up in prison this time last year.

Today, he's one of the top NFT artists. Where My Vans Go is 2nd highest grossing photography collection of all time.

I learned about his story just this week, and felt it was important to share it.

94,"@PabloJiBa this is great stuff and one can tell you have tons of knowledge. if I'm reading this, I'm asking how I can apply this. to me, your content needs to be more actionable, and less of an overview. e.g. your restaurant example is gold and deserves its own thread."
95,"@Charles_Haworth good one, man! the last two tweets can be combined. twitter tends to show the first and last tweet of the thread."

97,@chase_sutts spot on! my biggest impediment has been focusing on creating value at the expense of enjoying the process of writing.

If you're an artist, collector, or someone passionate about NFT photography and determined to propel the space forward, I'd love to talk to you.

Building, investing and innovating together has never been easier."

• pool &amp; manage capital
• form a DAO (and a legal entity, if necessary)
• invest in NFTs, tokens, and even startups
• handle tax &amp; compliance
