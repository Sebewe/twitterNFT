83,"@GratefulApe_eth I can not believe that in the year 2022 Brantley or any raging asshole would still have anything like that written on social. It’s as stupid as it is ignorant. Keep ENS names, lots of good people worked on the project. Vote him out"
84,@luislanderos46 Patience is key. I’m being facetious here. I want exposure to an irresponsible amount of projects. No amount of ETH is ever going to be enough
85,I could really use 100 more ETH
