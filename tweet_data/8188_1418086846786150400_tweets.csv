8,@Lollipo01574764 @ensdomains Hey! Working on making it update availability more in real time. Has taken me a little time though 😅
9,"@TheCryptoCactus $2500 eth, yum"
10,@BrantlyMillegan Well to my net worth it isn't 😬
11,@Austen That's basically shorting s&amp;p 500
12,@zebulgar Cex -&gt; L2 coming. Then this process will be much quicker and cheaper

26,@Brommhill https://t.co/mHSeudQPwd there are still basic dictionary words left :)
27,@dbzdoteth @KJJKETH Working on it! Needed to do a little refactor and add some pagination since this list is a bit longer than the original ones.

48,@BrantlyMillegan @RobertMondavi This is real brand flex 💪
49,@_jefflau Would you recommend these books in particula? Wanted to get into math again but The Princeton Companion to Mathematics turned out to be a little steep 😅.
50,@intocryptoast Omfg
51,@fintechfrank Wait 50% were overweight in 1965? I though this was a much more recent phenomenon
52,@sassal0x 3% down in 7 days
53,@MEV_Dad Welcome to the 🤖🤖family!
54,@draecomino Tokens would solve the marketing part
55,@epolynya Ah thanks!
56,@epolynya Maybe low iq question but how would apps work in this world e.g. ENS? How would they keep constitent data (e.g. ENS-names registrars etc.) across L2s?
57,@intocryptoast LFG🚀
58,@BrantlyMillegan British or America the Office?
59,@ralexstokes Does this even need to be said lol?

71,@SirOpsALot Blame Inflation. In the 50's one horsepower could power a factory and pay for college + medicare
72,@BrantlyMillegan @AlexPomeroy3 If I register a name on an L2 and use it as my primary. Can other users on L1 or other L2s send traction to my ens address?
73,@zerohedge He's right but who cares what he thinks?
74,Glad I bought more $ENS after airdrop
75,@EnsSales Wow nice!

81,@arbibotsNFT 🤖
82,@FalkorLucky @RaoulGMI @AdrianoFeria @SquishChaos @RyanSAdams @sassal0x $73K is so hilariously arbitrary and specific lol. They probably get away with that in tradifi
83,@patrickc 🤯🤯🤯🤯
84,@NathanHeadPhoto Fml bought three letter Ens - thought it was expensive 0.2eth so only purchases a year. Longer name for 8 years would have been cheaper 😭😭😭
85,@ASvanevik Turns out it was the bear case

87,@NathanHeadPhoto Confused me for months
88,@bertcmiller Dark Forest vibes
