1,@mattborchert As someone with six figures law school loans … this post truly hits home. I am SO proud of you! That’s a huge boulder off your shoulders. So happy for you and I don’t even know you. 👏🍾❤️
2,"My space @doodles piloting ability is a 2 of 8. No duh, I got a freaken blue check mark on my face. My question is who has a 1 of 8 😂 Don’t be shy! https://t.co/NeYQAkdbE8"
3,@MBF_ETH @MrJamesonNeat @doodles Your self discipline is remarkable. I couldn’t wrap fast enough 😅
4,"@cryptobreaky @doodles Mayday, Mayday, Mayday! This is big beep mk3. My spaceship has made contact with flying crystal debris. Attempting emergency landing. Visibility low. All I see is a blue check mark. I repeat. All I see is a blue check mark."
5,"I feel like with space @doodles, it’s no longer about your individual doodle and more about the community and space missions. Anyone else get that vibe when wrapping? I think this is genius. Absolute genius for a brand."
6,@WonderPals If I somehow reveal this … I will vow to never complain about any NFTs for the rest of my life.
7,"@cryptobreaky @doodles Wait, what? Bro! https://t.co/592pu0sllv"
8,"@omori888 @doodles @InvsbleFriends @MotionMarkus @alfiemotion For sure. There is no doubt about it. True geniuses ahead of their times. For me, the space doodles is so good … I’m no longer finding myself longing to get in on IFs."
9,Real question: does the space @doodles take some of the aura away from @InvsbleFriends? Yay or Nay.
10,"The only downside to space @doodles is that it messes with the @Twitter pfp verification. The new image doesn’t look as good as the original doodles pfp. But, that’s the price we pay to go to the moon!"

75,"@MinnesotaHaze For you, do you consider tax consequences? ie short term/long term capital gains when selling or focus more on maximizing profit and dealing with tax at the end?"
76,@MinnesotaHaze Agreed! I fall in the trap of ONLY considering my initial investment and not ALSO the expected return of my current NFTs. I need to learn when to just take profits and to be content no matter if it goes ⬆️ or ⬇️ #controlgreed
