20,"@jasonzweigwsj Jason, love the article. You should take a look at crypto indexes like https://t.co/w034cJ0OvC and https://t.co/EZoMPCeCcE They of course come with their own significant risks but are worth evaluating in the context of people already invested in crypto seeking diversification"
21,The full complaint is located at: https://t.co/tRfKWPgGk1
22,The traditional StockX marketplace essentially already relies upon this legal doctrine. The question now before us is how this existing legal framework will apply to the use of NFTs to facilitate the sale of branded physical assets.
23,"Arguably, StockX may use the Nike trademarks as is necessary to accurately identify the origin of Nike shoes and to provide a marketplace for the resale of authentic Nike shoes, so long as the use of the mark does not suggest an affiliation or endorsement from Nike."
24,"“…[I]t is undisputed that trademark owners cannot use trademark law to prevent the resale of authentic, trademarked goods.” Tiffany Inc. v. eBay, Inc., 576 F. Supp 2d 463 (S.D.N.Y 2008)."
25,"In another example, in Tiffany Inc. v. eBay, Inc., the Court held that eBay’s use of the Tiffany mark on their homepage for purposes of advertising was nominative fair use."
26,"Nominative fair use allows the use of another’s trademark in advertising the availability of trademarked goods. This is from the New Kids on the Block v. News Am. Publ’g, Inc., 971 F.2d 302 (9th Cir. 1992) case."
27,the 1) product or service is not readily identifiable without use of the trademark; 2) use only so much of the mark as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service; and 3) use of the mark does not suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark owner.
28,Nominative fair use permits use of another’s trademark to refer to the trademark owner’s goods and services associated with the mark. Nominative fair use generally is permissible as long as ...
29,"Instead, the complaint alleges only trademark claims and related state law unfair competition claims. Under trademark law, StockX may be able to rely on the concept of “nominative fair use.”"
30,"Generally, a seller’s exclusive rights to the sale of physical goods extends only to the so-called “first sale.” However, the ‘first sale’ doctrine arises under copyright law. Interestingly Nike did not assert any claims premised under copyright law."
31,"I think the Nike v. StockX case raises novel legal issues, including how the sale of an NFT representing a physical asset can be used to trade an underlying physical good, as well as how this fact-set should be viewed from a legal perspective."
32,Nike just filed an interesting complaint against StockX in the SDNY regarding StockX's new Vault NFT platform which uses NFTs to trade authentic physical shoes (including Nike shoes).

35,"@laurashin It seems to be a classic case of innovator's dilemma. Market demand is there and someone will build to meet that demand. Incumbents could speed up that adoption, or it can be someone else. New use cases will change public perception and convert skeptics into fans over time."

57,"@Jon_Sharples Hard to speak to comparative odds of success... I will say that typically proof of ""fame"" for purposes of dilution can be difficult. Hermès alleges this is essentially admitted in a Defendant interview “The Birkin Bag by Hermès is such a status symbol across the globe.” Para 100"
58,The full Complaint is located here and the case is before Judge Alison Nathan in the SDNY: https://t.co/FTG12OzQkA
59,"The dilution claim is interesting because it may allow an avenue for the court to find liability even in the absence of consumer confusion, if METABIRKIN ""dilutes the distinctive quality of the BIRKIN Mark"" and related goodwill stemming from the alleged fame of the BIRKIN mark."
60,"The complaint alleges 7 counts, including trademark infringement, false designation of origin, dilution (claiming fame for the BIRKIN mark), cybersquatting under the ACPA, and NY common law trademark infringement and dilution."
61,"Hermès acknowledges that ""a digital image connected to an NFT may reflect some artistic creativity,"" but counters that ""the title of 'artist' does not confer a license"" to use the BIRKIN trademark to mislead consumers and identify Hermès as the true source of BIRKINs."
62,"Hermès also expresses concern over a “decentralized METABIRKINS exchange” which could potentially sell METABIRKINS NFTs without the need for NFT marketplaces like OpenSea (which has already removed the NFTs from their marketplace), Rarible, LooksRare, or Zora (i.e. CryptoPhunks)"
63,"Hermès alleges that the advertisement and sale of NFTs under the METABIRKINS brand will ""ultimately preempt Hermès’ ability to offer products and services in virtual marketplaces that are uniquely associated with Hermès and meet Hermès’ quality standards."""
64,"Hermès argues that while they have not yet
minted and sold Hermès NFTs, ""consumers would expect that NFTs featuring famous brands are affiliated with those brands, or wonder why the famous brands are permitting such dilutive use of their valuable assets"" and think less of them."
65,"Well perhaps it was inevitable that Hermès would sue the MetaBirkin NFT project, but here we go...
