1,@TheBallHawk @RobGronkowski @HeritageAuction There were monster items in this auction.  It had a massive bidder count.  The word was for sure out.  Jackie Robinson stuff shattered records. Lots of amazing stuff.  This ball just got lost in all the 🔥
2,@Sanfran49erfan8 @proof_xyz @TomBrady @kevinrose @ryancarson Yeah.  A lot of them not happy with how I spent my money.  If they want to send me a bunch of free money I’ll give them a little more oversight in my decisions. Lol.
3,"Fun making a winning bet. I used my free 🆘 airdrop to buy more @proof_xyz (which I tweeted I was doing). 

Rolled 1 of my Proofs at 28ETH to scoop this IRL @TomBrady Super Bowl TD ball for just 24ETH (rare AF - 21 🐐 SB TDs). 

Thank u 🆘 anon and @kevinrose @ryancarson et al. https://t.co/LoGfw1RuEN"
4,@phisigfsu @TomBrady 😬 this one is PC I’m afraid.  I don’t usually flex the PC wins but since TB12 tweeted about it…I couldn’t resist.
5,Not sure why they priced this in fiat tho.  It was like 23 ETH :)
6,"Nice indeed @TomBrady.  I was pumped to win this one. 

My son gets to catch a pass from TB12 at a charity event coming up this spring. Dead ass gonna ask him to use this ball.  Notch another big Brady TD for it. https://t.co/D4Jx1Dil2w"
7,@TomBrady I scooped this on Heritage auctions.  See you soon @TomBrady in Naples for my son to do the TD charity catch thing with you.  We can use this ball and notch another TD for it.  Maybe Gronk can play DB - I think he’s there too. @TomBrady @darrenrovell

14,@DanielHromas @pennysleever @ScoopCommons Sorry.  Didn’t see this sooner. Various rewards that they two characters have to give out.  Too much for a tweet but it’s all in a discord announcement.

18,@brettl111 @AllCarofine @Blokpax What was the trade?
19,@Richard76698342 @AdamReefs @Blokpax @AllCarofine @NFT But if you want one. It can’t hurt to make your best offer and it will send an email to all holders. Never know when someone needs a quick $200. 🤷🏽‍♂️
20,@Richard76698342 @AdamReefs @Blokpax @AllCarofine @NFT $200 usd?   Best shot at that might be a drop in Eth.  I saw the floor on hero mint pass was .48 earlier.  There were a few actual minted ones cheaper. .29 I think was floor.
21,"@EDub_Crypto @Blokpax My anecdotal evidence from this auction would support the case that values are rising.

It is worth noting that I’m bidding on lower pop cards. I still question long term viability where supply is over produced and more importantly over slabbed/graded.  The junk slab era is real."
22,"I won NOTHING tonight in the PWCC premier (personal or for the @blokpax fam).  

First major auction I have goose egged on in over a year.  I made some nice bids so wasn’t lack of effort. 

Bottom might be in for sports cards.  Will see how HA goes next weekend."

29,"@Richard76698342 @AdamReefs @Blokpax @AllCarofine @NFT You can get Legend Mint passes for 1.2-1.7 range.  Hero Mint passes have been around .3.  

Saw one guy that listed a Hero slightly below the mint pass price. 

Note. We didn’t sell any Mint passes.  They were earned or won by the community.  So it’s organic price discovery."

36,@MetaVsMe @Blokpax @bjamps Haha. Most people don’t want to read the project whale story.  BJamps has crushed it tho.

38,"Love it.  This warms my heart.  If you aren’t in @blokpax you are missing a fun ride.  Set building with ‘collect to earn’ staking on the way.  

And oh yeah. We give away NFTs that are proof of ownership of real trading cards of high value on the regular. https://t.co/WMgrghhSzi"
39,"Looking at some recent token launches.   

1) Most define “utility” far more broadly than I do.  

2) token supply inflation will ALWAYS come home to roost. It’s not IF. It’s simply when.  

There is a healthy “inflation to utility ratio”.  But I see it consistently overshot."

41,@zehttys That’s sick.

43,I believe there is a right balance of “skin in the game” that will make for the strongest ecosystems. Nailing erc-20 tokenomics in my projects is a huge focus and I agree that so many are spinning the flywheel up so fast that only 1 result is plausible. 99% will crash hard. https://t.co/ryDtlEyJED
44,@Heisenserg_ @andrwwang @AdamBombSquad Where did the bombs appear?  I was actually trying to keep an eye out and never saw them (I was also laughing it up with friends and probably just didn’t see it).
45,@SealSteph No. It’s not out yet.
46,@ilrockya Tend to agree. I felt like the momentum was building towards it especially with Andreessen in the mix.  Felt like their way. But I’m thinking not likely at this point.  But. Would be cool.
47,@wilhelm_zachary @Blokpax @ScoopCommons @pennysleever If you hold @blokpax Infinite Moments and a @CollisionXArt Mamba addition the price will be much less painful.  Free.

57,@All4airdrops1 @tikifestival I commented in discord that all tokens will need to have good utility for the project to do well.  Im not sure if people thought we were just gonna ignore the uncarved ones or what.   But awareness seems to be spreading a bit.
58,@jeffs5511 @tikifestival Dropping a robust plan in next 10 days or so.  Then the next wave of IP licensing.  So just sit tight right now but maybe turn notis on for @tikifestival tweets.  Discord announcements and Twitter are main places for the info when it drops.

Utility tokens coming to both @blokpax and @tikifestival projects. This vid covers my thoughts relative to Blokpax but don’t expect me to change what I believe is important for Tiki either.
