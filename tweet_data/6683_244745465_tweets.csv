2,Only a few will survive an NFT bear. Who you backing? (Excluding #BAYC #MAYC obvs)
3,@KingofOneself_ What would you have instead? &amp; what if the game was already in development? (Most P2E is a pipe dream that can’t actually be fulfilled)
4,"@aitzal18 If ETH surpasses $3.5k, it could well do but would still be similar value"
5,#MAYC to 12 ETH? 👀👾
6,@boredape101 #thankyoukevin 🐢
7,@WizKingNFT I’m here for the art. Won’t ever mint something I hate the look of!
8,@boredgentleman Right with you on this
9,"RT @boredgentleman: I see it like this:

31,"Non #NFT folk 

Locked outside in the rain angrily staring at us in the VIP lounge surrounded by models cuz we have a few $1,000 to spend to each of their $20.  

But they explain to the security that you’re exactly the same because they went to your school 20 years ago. 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/QFimoQrAgo"
32,What’s the best new project minting this week? Bullish vibes everywhere.
33,@thejpegqueen Huge week.
34,"RT @PuffYatty: mfers by @sartoshi_nft just did 100x from mint

- didn't sell out instantly
- no gas war 
- mint price of .069
- no WL
- no…"
35,@momsfavreseller That’s cap

39,"Don’t let anyone convince you to diamond hand if you need the money. 
Play your own game.

Look after you."
40,@sunalNFT @AzukiZen @ZZZAGABOND @steamboy33 @DemnaAzuki #AZUKIBABY 👶🏼
41,@itsdanataylor Nice! My whole garage is murdered out 🏴🏴🏴. Pure vibes
42,"Who’s ready for the #MAYC pump to 50 ETH? 

Screenshot this."
43,@getblaised I see it’s definitely changed over the last 3 months.
44,What’s the target market of #BAYC ?
45,@WizKingNFT Wen moon
46,"Most PFP projects fail because it doesn’t serve the simple purpose:

BE A SICK PFP."
47,@mncady Thank you sir
48,"This is web 2.5 not Web 3.0

It becomes Web 3.0 when the influencers stop trying to take from their followers, and when we buy NFT’s because we love em, and not to quick flip wen lambo. #NFTs"
49,@avixeth @AzukiZen Gm Bean!! Love the tones on these
50,@takoa__ RED BEAN CHIP SIR
51,"The fact that Tsuki is the literal Japanese translation for ‘to the moon’ makes me want to avoid at all costs.

52,Is #BAYC derivative season over?
53,@UmarKamani Looks rare.
54,@TheRickHerr @BoredApeYC It makes 0 sense 😅😅
55,@chogunna It’s the low key matching outfits for me 🔥🔥😭
56,@TookTheRedBean @AzukiZen Love the red combo!
57,@Fren_D_Ape Anything anti grind that creates a solid community
58,"Jacked Ape Club shows another reason why WL’s are fake scarcity &amp; fake value. 

Bring back the public mint gas war days 🤤🔥"
59,@AlyssaMetaverse @BoredApeYC Already has! Most definitely created the movement we see today
60,"If a project goes up 50% on OS from mint, and you have a low quality Whitelist = they’ll be listing &amp; flipping before the project can get any real rocket fuel momentum.

A few hundred $ is a lot for most WL grinders. 

It’s a vicious cycle for the Wen moon gang. 🌙"
61,@WizKingNFT I sold BAYC for 1 ETH. So much fun.
62,"WL’s done wrongly can fundamentally crash a project before it’s even had the chance to start.

WL’s are typically made up of lower value investors (they have the time to grind servers days at a time) &amp; you simply cannot expect these people to diamond hand. 

They’ll sell. Always."
63,@UmarKamani None of what anyone will try and shill here. Lol.

77,I’ll stick with the OG. https://t.co/qpgZU5MISD
78,@food_pyramid People buy into overhyped projects and repeat. It’s as though we learned nothing from Mekaverse..
