13,"@jchaselubitz Not necessarily, specially when the coop doesn't adopt a stock model and goes directly to membership model. W DAOs, I anticipate it being a challenge bc many adopt both a founder model w core team incentives + a token model that simply mimics stocks."
14,"@ddwchen Yes. Yet, not seeing too much of this in web3. Don't @ me."
15,Any legal entity can be formed w/in a few minutes. The ❓is whether the members/owners/stake-stock-holders reach understandings about how they operate. That takes time. You technically don't need an att'y for the first part. You're better off working w a professional on the 2nd.
16,Tho it's a sad day for fun facts. 😔
17,"Fun fact, my colleagues @ldp7744 and @jasonwienerpc first used the expression ""The Delaware of Cooperative Law"" in this 2018 article in reference to Colorado's coop statutes. And then our firm trademarked it in 2020.

18,@sabahlaw @ericprestonETH #badlegaltake
19,"@natesuits Yes, I should have been more clear."
20,"@tripluca In the US, nor adopting a legal entity type IS adopting a general partnership entity type. It doesn't get riskier than that."
21,That's one of my takeaways from the convos I had at @EthereumDenver https://t.co/eW7ljn6846
22,@ericprestonETH Yes!
23,@todd_x_y @mdudas @exittocommunity @ntnsndr @MuchnikYev I've mentored a news org converting to a coop format; i could see it working tho after @EthereumDenver i might be more conflicted about the variety of definitions ppl give to DAO as a concept.
24,"@lex_DAO @nembal I'm thinking of a mutual, or community indemnity fund, or DAO captive insurance."
25,@PeterPanYes @lex_DAO I'm a member ;) see you there?
26,a DAO to provide insurance coverage/liability protection for all DAOs that choose not to adopt a formal legal structure.

35,"So we are clear, I played it really cool in the green room w @GovofCO and @VitalikButerin and commissioner Tung Chan. 😬🤯"
36,"Listening to a VC suggesting that full shared governance is not good for business. 

Coops have faced similar issues &amp; there're lots if lessons to learn from that. Educate your investors if you need it; adopt processes that address lack of engagement. Be serious about onboarding."

52,Any Ohioans heading to @EthereumDenver ?
53,"I have lots more to talk about this and you can check our https://t.co/wPhNfyEEdQ blog posts on that. Know this, it's super important to have an open and grounded convo w your att'y AND accountant about your revenue model. If I'm gonna be that person, please bring graphics. 😅"
54,"If this distribution is properly made, the entity doesn't pay taxes on the part of the surplus that is distributed. The members receiving the patronage returns are responsible for their own taxes over that amount. The entity does issue a 1099-PATR at that point. No double tax."
55,"In a coop, if there are profits left at the end (i.e surplus) generated by the activities of the members (in the offer of good/services), then that amount is distributable to the members as patronage returns also known as patronage dividends. Yes, the member gets two payments."
56,"On the entity side, payment for those are a cost. It comes out of the revenue. Entity typically generates revenue by providing goods/services to its customers and then covers the costs."
57,"In my DAO coop work I hear a lot about patronage, &amp; I still don't think we talk about it enough, in terms of legal implications. 
While work, services, contribution can def be patronage activities, these must be compensated for the original labels they have: work, services, etc."

61,"@brandonlovejoy @bytemaster7 @PopHopTopWop @EosNFoundation I'll give you my first immediate reaction (so take w a grain of salt); it reminds me of a certain current of cooperators, which sustain that ""true"" coops shouldn't allow investors, bc that's against instrumental &amp; subordinate nature of capital."

65,@auryn_macmillan I'd add @songadaymann

67,@lex_DAO @r_ross_campbell @jordanteague @gcosteloe @thetaxpanda See you all there!
68,The past few months we've supported a variety of DAOs to become a cooperative. Design sessions have been super important to identify what legal model makes sense to a group &amp; what type of legal support they actually need to reach their potential. https://t.co/NNrqOeXRwF
69,@markgrimes Credit unions are coop banks!

76,"@GeorgeGoognin For now, I'm just saying that DAOs are not exempt from 1099 requirements just because they are paying in tokens/property."
77,"❓ of the day: If a DAO pays you more than $600 during the year (accumulated amount), the DAO should be issuing you a 1099. If you are bartering with the DAO and/or other members, a 1099 might need to be issued in some cases too. Blog post coming soon!"
78,@lex_DAO @tmoindustries @r_ross_campbell Anything on legal/tax treatment of those?

Looking forward to reading this. I believe my colleague @jasonwienerpc was interviewed as part of this study. https://t.co/841lrDzuCB"
80,@RebeccaLamis @awrigh01 Deal!
81,@JulzRoze R.I.P.
82,@awrigh01 I really want to see a DAO where all other DAOs gather resources in expectation of IRS or SEC major questioning that would impact a big portion of the sector. Another use would be to identify good cases to - actively - put it to test. I'll join that DAO.

87,"@jramos1445 @jasonwienerpc @economic_lab @ajscholz In an LCA, patrons must have majority voting and investors will have minority at 49%. Investment itself is not considered patronage, so pure investors are never patrons."
88,It feels so good to leave a meeting and immediately address all the deliverables from that meeting; and to bad that's not realistic for most of my meetings.
89,@TrustlessState Or the process is in the way of it.
90,RT @MariaShen: Who are the best technical women in crypto?
91,"@economic_lab @ajscholz Not sure if we have, but I'll look for it. I do think that's a feature of limited cooperative associations (LCAs), which is a regular use in our practice, &amp; most practitioners and professionals are not familiar with it."
92,"@dapperjman Some states have laws that treat them as ""nonprofit"" entities (not 501c3), but it's bc they're not created for the profit of the entity, but for the benefit of its members. Any profits are typically allocated to the members as patronage dividends, based on the member's activities"
93,"@ajscholz Technically, cooperatives can have voting based on patronage activity, and that's what I'm seeing DAOs adopt."
94,"Thinking in terms of reporting, taxation (barter? 1099? crypto/property treatment?)"
95,"How is #lawtwitter dealing with payments (rewards, bounties) made by DAOs to contributors?"
96,@MiguelPradosR Tell me more.
97,@dotCoop @ajscholz @todd_x_y @jasonwienerpc @founderscoop @icacoop Do you all have a stand on decentralized autonomous organizations that subscribe to and have adopted the coop modrl?

99,"Does your group abide by the 7 coop principles? Voluntary &amp; Open Membership, Democratic Member Control, Member's econ participation, Autonomy &amp; Independence (from outsiders), Education/Training/Information, cooperation among coops, concern for community.

Did I describe DAOs?"
