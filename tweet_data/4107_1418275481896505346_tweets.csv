16,@TeslaPodcast @TeslaPodcast On an LTM basis?
17,"@larvalabs Please clarify what you mean by ‘used to purchase real Cryptopunks.’ Is the implication that LL will hold 1000 v1 punks just in case they appreciate in value and, at some point, those will be sold to buy floor Cryptopunks?"
18,@fluf2148 @FLUF_World @fluf2148 we’re already at a 6 eth floor! (5 hours after that post)
19,@IAMNAX23 @FLUF_World @partybearNFT @altstatemachine @JaduHologram That’s correct.
20,@Scott50693316 hell yeah. tie dye club https://t.co/aDYD4WV2pj
21,"@j1mmyeth In principle, this should be correct as it is for any interest or dividend yielding securities. The curveball from $LOOKS is that rewards must be valued based on unpredictable volume projections (multiplied by 2% fees) and the moving target of the avg # of tokens staked over time"
22,@wagmifactory gm gm! appreciate you too! @FLUF_World has the strongest community I’ve seen in the NFT space. Period. See you on the moon 🚀 🌙
23,"@fluf2148 @FLUF_World @altstatemachine @partybearNFT @JaduHologram @GinoTheGhost @fluf2148 love your updates because by the time i check twitter and read them, the real floor is always higher"

30,@franalations23 @allnick How much less BAYC token will BAKC holders recieve than MAYC holders? Where is this type of information available? (cc: @sephwest)
31,@seedphrase you should say something original for once
32,@beaniemaxi @larvalabs did this first with meebits. BAKC was lazy artwork and not at all innovative relative to meebits.
33,@beaniemaxi @beaniemaxi What elements of the PR machine are you referring to?
34,@cyounessi1 LOVE $CIG!

50,"@billelis this is phenomenal. dead royalty, frozen in time, supernatural and proclaiming his love. a blend of superficial wealth and mortality. very thought provoking."
51,@JaduHologram Super psyched for the Hoverboard!!! I signed up for the hoverboard presale list a week or so ago on my computer but didn’t go through the iPhone app (I don’t link my Metamask with my iPhone for security reasons). Are only app users being accepted at this time?
52,Crypto/NFT market analysis would benefit greatly from researchers connecting the dots between govt stimulus and cash inflow/outflows into crypto assets. Would love to see any publications if work has been done in that space.
53,Very compelling illustration from @jpmorgan’s #JPMCInstitute today showing stimulus impact on 1.6mm sampled checking accounts and the relative savings volatility of lower income households. Full article: https://t.co/Ua2bueVdHB https://t.co/KKzqChFpdv
