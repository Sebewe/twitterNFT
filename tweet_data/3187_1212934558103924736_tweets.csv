18,"@lanitrock @GitcoinDAO For years I’ve felt uneasy about positioning our work as a non profit or charity, because we want to promote empowerment, fair payment for artists; a sense of accomplishment rather than sympathy. Reframing our work as public goods makes all of the sense. (Paraphrasing complexity)"

88,@Adbusters A post scarcity web3 model for funding public goods: @gitcoin (supporting another auction at ETHdenver:solar punk) I think there’s a lot to dialogue about vs turning your back on us. That’s not how real progress happens. Want to share opinions to 20k viewers at ETHdenver? Hmu.
89,"@Adbusters we are hosting our auction on a carbon neutral nft platform - doingud powered by polygon- and assangedao just raised $38M in crypto for Julian assanges court case, all the while you bully a grassroots art collective that has been inspired by you for a decade +. Cool."
