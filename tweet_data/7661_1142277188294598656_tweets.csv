They're all partnered with one of the top, global entertainment agencies @threesixzero

21,"@ElliotAvidane @brokemoney84 @NFTherder @TheHumanoidsNFT What part of these claims are flase?

Is the metadata not stored on someone's github account? 

Is the actual asset not stored on a central storage, retrieved by their own api?"
22,"@ElliotAvidane @brokemoney84 @NFTherder @TheHumanoidsNFT I understand that, but the idea that even if the domain expires, everything's fine, is wrong."
23,"@brokemoney84 @NFTherder @TheHumanoidsNFT Lmfao if the domain expires, then it's a rug.

You'd be pointing to a domain that no longer exists and maps to a resolvable address.

The ""dev"" should look up what DNS is."

It's one of those areas that definitely needs an improvement/solution."
30,@Afc_Bling @PatrickTimmons1 What the actual fuck is this comment lmfao.
31,"@dlkingauthor @ryder_ripps Yeah that's kinda the model of web3 right? You're the sole owner of your authentication and identity.

I believe the recovery aspect is one of the key areas a lot of players in the space are trying to solve. I think ""social recovery"" is one method but yeah, it's tricky to solve"

This is extremely differently than private &amp; public keys, which are generated via some cryptography algorithm.

Your Twitter password is not owned by you."

Your cancelation has been post poned."
36,@replicode_eth truly the top signal
37,yeah maybe web3 was a bad idea https://t.co/iTzGH2VMmt
38,"@ryder_ripps No that's not right.

Authentication in web3 is based on user owned, cryptographic generated private &amp; public keys. 

You own your keys. This is completely different than a username and password, which is stored directly on a centrally owned data storage."

How does this work with hosting via Ipfs?"
47,@DeveloperAlly @kelseyhightower @FleekHQ How does geo location traffic work if hosting on IPFS?
48,"@kelseyhightower Most Web3 frontends are hosted on PaaS like Heroku or Digital Ocean anyways.
