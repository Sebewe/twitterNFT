2,@cyber_hokie Can you explain on on-chain negates his hot-take? Asking so I can learn.
3,"@HeyTaiZen Congrats Tai, well earned for taking risks others wouldn’t."
4,@kelseyhightower @mdbrinker Curious what your takeaways are?
5,"@jespow Thing I respect most about you and @krakenfx is that despite dealing with regulatory nightmares, you’ve kept the crypto ethos in your company culture. I send every newb I know to your exchange for that reason."
6,"@nic__carter Actually would love your comments on the sustainability of UST. So far it holds it’s peg, even in sharp downturns, better than centralized stables."
7,@superphiz @coinbase @krakensupport @prylabs The question I have is: why don’t they care? I’ve always seen both exchanges as being knowledgable &amp; intent on helping the ecosystem with wider crypto adoption. What’s the reason they stick to one client despite it being negative for the ecosystem? Genuinely confused.
8,"@jchervinsky @BlockchainAssn Jake, you are the MVP of the crypto-world right now (in my eyes anyhow). Your tweets are invaluable and appreciated. Keep it up my good man, and thanks for being a general on the front-lines."
9,@wotterdog I think El Salvador’s being watched as the test-pilot. A lot is riding on it’s success (FOMO follows if successful)
10,"@Vitalz1000 @PointPaul @doodles It makes our characters more unique and exciting / diverse. In short, it’s also fun."
11,@nic__carter Sorry but it’s the Bitcoin guys like @saylor and @maxkeiser who are practically begging regulators to go after everything non-BTC. Satoshi be proud.

15,@twobitidiot Cool calm collected. Your com skills are up there ser. 👏
16,"@0xUST @stablekwon @Nationals @terra_money I used to love the Montreal Expos. With this move, I swear I have a team to cheer for again- will also go see games live thanks to this move @stablekwon @terra_money - and pay in UST"
17,RT @novogratz: $eth is the currency of culture.
18,@sassal0x Care to weight in @CoinbaseWallet ?
19,@sassal0x They said plenty of times they are working on this and support it. Let’s give them a break with some patience.
20,"@RyanSAdams @solana @terra_money @avalancheavax @aeyakovenko @el33th4xor @stablekwon I am curious as to their plans (exact details, into the weeds) to further dedentralize. The “how” exlained. I.e. what number of validators do they ideally want to get to, and how will they make validating accessible to normies."

22,@yorkerhodes What is your best guess at how long these issues will take to be resolved?
23,"@Debussy100 I don’t think it’s dead, they are also taking the long &amp; steady road &amp; I’m guessing they will have their hype cycle because it’s one of the few real innovative chains."

26,@sandeepnailwal Are there effective groups educating the political class there? There seems to be a large knowledge gap at the political level.
27,@hodlonaut It seems clear those who criticize him don’t actually listen to his show (where Joe is tough on guests and questions all points of view). Leaders who form strong opinions and want to take action based on headlines they read - terrifying.
28,@nachodonUST @maxkeiser Both @saylor and Keiset have been begging the government to intervene. I’m not sure whether its more comical or pathetic. Satoshi would be proud.
29,@cburniske It already has been.

31,RT @HesterPeirce: The string of bitcoin spot ETP denials has continued into 2022.  The rationale underlying them doesn't get any better wit…
32,"@alc_anthro @iamDCinvestor They simply plug into the infrastructure on behalf of their clients is what I mean. They could go from offering 0 to at least some interest/yield. Just feels like they are archaic, slow-moving and missing this whole thing"
33,@stacyherbert You may wanna see someone about your insecurity complex. can’t be healthy.
34,"@Immutable @moonpay Question for you guys, if an NFT resides on immutable, can it then be moved to eth mainnet or is it stuck in your neighborhood?"
35,@iamDCinvestor Shouldn’t banks be embracing and pushing Defi as a yield mechanism for the customers? They’d run the infrastructure in the background and customers get to deal with the bank they trust. What the hell is wrong with these institutions? No brainer.

50,@ZigZagExchange Maybe don’t promote that Bitcoin maxi term especially as an exchange- just sayin.
51,@BanklessHQ @RepTomEmmer
52,"@KyleReidhead @Immutable Once an NFT sits on an L2 like Immutable, can it easily be moved to ETH Layer 1 (or even other Layer 2’s like Optimism)? Or, are we stuck in one neighborhood?"
53,@laurashin Congrats Laura. Is the book available in kindle format?
54,"@arbitrum @binance This question will sound silly, but once I bridge some eth from my address to L2 Arbitrum, is my eth address the same on L1 and L2 or do I get a unique Arbitrum address that is different from L1?"
55,@cburniske Not before flushing many out through PTSD and fear of another drawdown (which everyone seems convinced will happen).

60,@Is_Keith_Smooth @mrmakerbot Thanks dood :)
61,@mrmakerbot Hey hey! Love this club. ♥️
62,@Ledger_Support It feels like you guys have no understanding and haven’t read the actual complaint/ticket. Your responses having nothing to do with the problem whatsoever.
63,@saylor You represent the true ethos of #Bitcoin Mr. @saylor - hanging on regulators’ every word and cheering for them to intervene in crypto markets (rather than fix 100 year old laws built for a bygone era). We are lucky to have you.
64,"@scottmelker Not really, selling valuable assets that are mathematically secure like eth and btc for devaluating fiat feels uncomfortable and risky."
65,@Ledger_Support Its not a connection issue - the ledger live connects (says connected) - problem is after being connected the other app doesn’t detect it. Its ios so connecting wireless (no usb)
66,"@WalletConnect When connecting via @Ledger live on IOS, the wallet shows as “connected” but after that, nothing happens (the other end-point is not connected). Stuck on ledger live “connected” screen, but other end-point is not connected. Bug exists for all dapps."
67,@argentHQ Staking through @Rocket_Pool
68,@RoKhanna @paulkrugman Isn’t this the same guy that said nobody would use the internet?
69,@terra_station Any plans to allow ledger connection to the IOS Terra Station app?
70,"@thrillville1 @cobie @xbtbabe @TheReal_cbc I don’t pretend to know all that and wont take moral high-ground. We don’t live there, don’t know him etc. I just agree with the gutsy call he made on making Crypto legal tender. Someone had to be first, and being first is risky so I applaud it."
71,"@cobie @xbtbabe @TheReal_cbc I think was he did took some courage, and I am cheering for the experiment to be a success. It’s success would be good for crypto. Too much negativity like this on twitter."
72,@bchesky Crypto payments yes.
73,"RT @LeonidasNFT: Petition for @twitter to let us verify our ENS names.

74,"@APompliano I have been preaching this kind of messaging since the beginning, so refreshing. El Salvadore is showing the way forward. @nayibbukele doing it right."
75,@giancarloMKTS Public chain or?
76,@cobie Enjoying your blog posts Ser. Excellent &amp; all substance. 👏
77,@MrJamesonNeat @doodles Greetings Fren
78,@iii_OIO_iii @novogratz @prism_protocol @mars_protocol Him or Galaxy being irrelevant is indeed the goal. Project must be much bigger than 1-2 VC’s.
79,@iii_OIO_iii @novogratz @prism_protocol @mars_protocol @novogratz seems like a great guy but values $ over ideology or community. I remember him talking up his investments (like FunFair) in 2017-18 and he dumped the shit out of them on retail. Winning projects must become ideological movements that exclude single points of failure.
80,@udiWertheimer @twobitidiot He said more useful though. You can do 10 thousand useful things with eth.
81,@stablekwon Wen breaktime for you. Nobody in crypto deserves it more.
82,@twobitidiot @cdixon
83,@udiWertheimer Except for all the others
84,@lopp @github Thanks for sharing
85,@benjaminsimon97 @WSJ @SenWarren Excellent letter and Bravo. The progressives still don’t seem to grasp the “equality” Defi on open protocols create. Suddenly the kid in a poor Nigerian village has the same financial opportunity as one that grew up in the American suburbs. In principle it is a great equalizer.
86,"@cutetenti @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks My hole isn’t that bad- come over for beer, you seem like such a lovely soul."
87,@Jet_iiv @pedrostella5 @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks I am guessing by the tone and substance of your replies that you will have a hard life (that’s likely already the case). Good luck ser.
88,"@Jet_iiv @pedrostella5 @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks See thats the problem with you, you attack intent as if you know what others’ intents are. It’s deplorable. Stick to facts, stop attacking characters and spitting toxic venom and the world might become a better place for you."
89,"@Jet_iiv @pedrostella5 @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks Tell me more about the details of how it was an attempted takeover &amp; attack (facts only plz, no conspiracies)."
90,"@pedrostella5 @Jet_iiv @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks I think the early guys helped it survive and thrive. They went against the grain and had guts. No matter their views today, the BTC you adore exists and thrives in part due to their efforts."
91,@cutetenti @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks Actually go see the oldest images of 2-3 lonely guys manning Bitcoin booths at tradeshows. Bitcoin was nothing then. Erik was amongst those 2-3 guys telling the world. You should be grateful.
92,"@Jet_iiv @pedrostella5 @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks It wasn’t an attack - it was a different vision on scaling Bitcoin. In the end, he was on the side that lost. That’s okay, it forked and everyone found their tribe. He still likes BTC btw. Your “he became a shitcoiner” sounds like an old-man barking at clouds rant. Spare me."
93,"@Jet_iiv @pedrostella5 @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks He praises Bitcoin in interview after interview (they are on youtube) So he is a bitcoin supporter. Not just that but he’s partially responsible for it’s success as an early advocate. If you are pissed because he also likes other innovation, have fun staying poor, thats on you"
94,"@pedrostella5 @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks Your personal attacks on his intent is deplorable. If he made profit on his businesses (shapeshift, satoshi dice) that’s admirable. He never scammed anyone."
95,"@ibz @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks Never said it was bad, he’s an amazing builder and has admirable conviction imo."
96,@pedrostella5 @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks You should be thanking him instead of signalling. He’s hugely responsible for btc’s early success when nobody believed in it. You seem ungrateful
97,@notgrubles @BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks It was a disagreement not an attack. It’s okay to have different views on things. In the end bitcoin survived and others forked it - nothinf wrong with that
98,"@BigTechAlert @ErikVoorhees @jack @blocks Erik welcomes debate and open disagreement in the interest of learning. @jack is seemingly convinced he has the answers. Erik helped build bitcoin from earliest stage, jack built a web2 for profit entity"
99,@scott_lew_is I don’t think he’s a toxic guy and has the right intentions. It feels to me like he actually isn’t aware of what’s really happening in the ethereum ecosystem. Might just be a knowledge gap where he hasn’t looked deeply (enough) yet. 🤷
