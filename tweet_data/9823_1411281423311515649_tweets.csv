14,an added dimension NFTs bring to #art is having an immutable record of transaction timing. i have been buying #NFTs from #ukranian #artists today. Before NFTs you wouldnt be able to look back in 5 years and say with 100% certainty this was art purchased during this invasion. https://t.co/uBdZp5haA4
