32,@holyn @boop no idea he was an investor… im learning a lot of things in unfortunate ways the past 2 weeks 😢 (but he’s not my investor)
33,"@boop cause he isn’t? he isn’t tagged in this convo and he said he was going on airplane mode — i also don’t know him, this is just me seeing a tweet and commenting on it"
34,@mikedemarais @jamiew ive always been talking about power dynamics since my first tweet — the idea that you can talk about capitalism and not talk about power is ludicrous
35,"@mikedemarais @jamiew i think u should consider more deeply the power dynamic that is between us before tweeting more, and i mean that with lots of love"
36,"@mikedemarais @jamiew do u think that your position as a founder and my boss creates a power dynamic that makes you pushing me about this publicly on the timeline not okay? even if i had feedback to give, i would avoid doing that publicly"
37,"@mikedemarais that’s great, means we have good investors (which i already knew) — but like that might be the case right now but it won’t stay that way if we grow the way we all hope we will

(and power/money impacts in many unseen ways)"
38,"@mikedemarais @jamiew i understand — i think your position as a founder makes you somewhat biased about that whether you like it or not… i also think Rainbow is an incredibly great place investor wise (otherwise i might not want to be here)

i also think money/power impacts things in many unseen ways"
39,@jamiew @mikedemarais a lot of this may come down to very different ideas of what “new systems” are — cool systems are not new systems. Popular systems or impactful systems are not new systems. I also think new systems can come from investment backed things.
40,@mikedemarais because from what i gather he has taken VC funding and seems to also be a partner? am i wrong? so it seems weird to me that he is pointing the finger at sxsw
41,"@mikedemarais i wish this were the case, but ive never seen it to be true"
42,"@mikedemarais @jamiew yes

also i think sometimes founders could do for a little distraction — laser focused and workaholic can produce many not great outcomes

but yeah my point is i think it is naive to think that SXSW hurts your ability to create new systems while investors/lots of money doesn’t"
43,"@mikedemarais (never said investors are bad, just that they have more influence than going to SXSW haha)"
44,@mikedemarais yeah i’d say having almost any investors in the traditional since will make it harder for you to create truly new systems — even the concept of a “startup” and all that entails is going to put a lot of obstacles in your way
45,"@jamiew im not really offering a solution cuz this shit is incredibly messy and i may think we’re too far down the river to do anything about it, just think it’s naive to point at SXSW when there’s a far larger elephant in the room"
46,"@mikedemarais maybe strings isn’t the right word, but “performance” and investor expectations usually does… a lot of things — i think about this from a standpoint of power dynamics"
47,@jamiew maybe this gives more context — im just stating an uncomfortable reality (not just here to dunk on VCs) https://t.co/MZQy21Oplh
48,and i say this as someone who has basically only ever worked for VC funded companies 😅 so im not saying this from a holier than thou position — just being realistic… vast sums of money (power) with strings attached does a helluva lot more than a film festival
49,pretty sure attending SXSW is far less harmful on your ability to create new systems than taking venture capital is
50,are you really building new systems if you’re reliant upon venture capital? https://t.co/SurZ7cDVhY

55,"there’s a weird and unhealthy power shift that occurs when someone reaches 10K followers — as in, many of us unknowingly (or knowingly) give more credence/status/importance to the words of 10K+ accounts… carte blanche. it’s an automatic thing that just occurs, but it shouldn’t"
56,"@alex_wykoff it’s ok, we all are in cringe in one way or another 🤝"
57,"@mikedemarais @boop i think it’s important to consider that the vast majority of NFT projects don’t reach this lvl of success, &amp; many aren’t even aiming for it because they know how insane it could get — i think this is part of why they didn’t have a discord, it seemed like an intentional speed bump"
58,@mikedemarais basically universal support and love for the WGMI team because the community is really coming to grips with how fucked up the dynamics of this ecosystem have become haha

98,@JasonHitchcock Yeah that’s an excellent point. We’ve never really seen a card game where high collector valuations occur so early — i definitely think they have their cards stacked against them (pun intended) 😂 hope they’re able to overcome the odds
99,"@JasonHitchcock yeah doubt they will hold value — could easily be a bubble and when the game drops and dissapoints, the value will collapse. High chance of that. I imagine people think about it as investing in a startup (and most startups fail)"
