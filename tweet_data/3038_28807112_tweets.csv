3,@kodaksh_nft @doodles Pretty sure they are 3 steps ahead of us. They aren’t going to do something like space doodles and be like “let’s see how this pans out”. They obviously know their shit

24,"@GiancarloChaux @GiancarloChaux this was actually a strategy I was going to take. However I actually realised if I “like” a certain NFT, I tend to be hesitant to let it go when the time comes. However if I feel “meh” about it, it’s easier to sell when I need to."
