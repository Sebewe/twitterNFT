4,"@boofyBurner @TheShamdoo @SweetBabyNicco @PuffyPawsPack Agreed but if a project raffles whitelist spots for another project they have to vette it, this shit does not happen with Cool Cats whitelists, every project is solid and vetted.   I accept that I didn’t do my due diligence, but don’t make excuses for these guys."
5,@flipcitynft @TheShamdoo @JPGJEFF @CryptoDeeby @PuffyPawsPack Yep and I accept that blame fully.
6,"@0xBender Yep.  I’m about to dump everything, scammers are running the show now.  Feels like December 2017."
7,RT @0xBender: NFTs draw many parallels to the coin ICOs in how they are marketed and promoted. This doesn't mean NFTs are bad and that all…
8,"@TheShamdoo @flipcitynft @JPGJEFF @CryptoDeeby @PuffyPawsPack It’s not the vibe, you are losing kids money, idc about me set me aside.  It’s not right in general.  Project is a hot mess it’s headed to zero and no one saying shit to you because you are young.  Well fuck that.  Get it together, either be a trader or run your project."
9,"@TheShamdoo @flipcitynft @JPGJEFF @CryptoDeeby @PuffyPawsPack You have a ticking clock, and the value of the project is headed to zero rn, and you can’t say “in development” forever, believe me that’s an old scam."
10,"@TheShamdoo @flipcitynft @JPGJEFF @CryptoDeeby @PuffyPawsPack selling tokens for a game that doesn’t exist, that’s fraud"
11,@flipcitynft @JPGJEFF @CryptoDeeby @PuffyPawsPack @TheShamdoo His head has gotten too big and I think a lawsuit will be the only thing to take him down a notch to reality.  Maybe someone will get it going…
12,"@flipcitynft @JPGJEFF @CryptoDeeby @PuffyPawsPack @TheShamdoo the thing is you and me we know sham from years ago, this isn’t some new guys calling him out, he has to listen knowing we knew him from card chefs when he was a nobody and his parents were paying for super expensive card breaks"
13,"@JPGJEFF @flipcitynft @CryptoDeeby @PuffyPawsPack @TheShamdoo Jeff you are in the scam network, us smart people get it.  Blocked.  Sham is being taken advantage of by guys like you and it’s a sad thing in a way because he is young and not aware of it all, but he’s also making money off all this so idk."
14,@JPGJEFF @PuffyPawsPack @TheShamdoo My mom has been sick and ever since I am a dogshit trader I’ll be honest.  I’m just distracted.  I shoukd have caught this yes.  Doesn’t make it right that it happened and the response by his team is even worse.
15,@flipcitynft @PuffyPawsPack @TheShamdoo I keep giving him the benefit of the doubt.  Shame on me.  But the response to this by him and his mods makes me think he is actually a scammer.  Bummer but we keep doing the right thing no matter what.

17,"@justjamesxyz @SweetBabyNicco @PuffyPawsPack @TheShamdoo Absolutely.  Shame on me for sure.  I did a quick vette the Twitter had 30k followers discord had 70k, but shame on me for trusting a project not to get me on a scam WL."
18,@TheShamdoo @SweetBabyNicco @PuffyPawsPack I’m never investing a penny into any of your projects or WL projects ever again.  GL.
19,"@PunkHot10 @TheShamdoo @SweetBabyNicco @PuffyPawsPack yeah agreed it is for a WL project, it’s the project’s responsibility, I assume I am in good hands if a project is blessing me with a WL spot won in a raffle that hundreds of people enter and 5 win"
20,"@TheShamdoo @SweetBabyNicco @PuffyPawsPack I know you are young, but this is an unacceptable response."
21,@SweetBabyNicco @PuffyPawsPack @TheShamdoo how hard is it to vette and only provide wl to good projects?  It’s not that hard to vette imo
22,I got scammed minting @PuffyPawsPack DO NOT MINT.  Won whitelist from @TheShamdoo Head Dao so I assumed it was vetted.  I lost 0.32 don't trust anyone and DO NOT MINT this project.  What the fuck sham.
