3,"@Simon_Goldberg Assuming you mean organizationally and operationally (as opposed to just collaboratively), yeah? 

None come to mind, but I think we’ll see it happen as these companies grow. Especially those who’s values, ethos, and visions are heavily aligned. Pooling talent and resources."
4,Soooooo excited about this! https://t.co/UPi0ZOjUN9
5,@DiscoverXnft Bro make it stop
6,@Zeneca_33 The opportunity to wake up and be better today than I was yesterday!
7,@DiscoverXnft No you
8,@Simon_Goldberg We don’t deserve to have nice things if this is the best we can do. 🥲
9,@DiscoverXnft It was never a matter of if this would happen. Only when.

13,@VictoriaSteve9 @DSMShark @DocGables @hourglass_nft No.
14,@DSMShark @DocGables @hourglass_nft I’ll be in Vegas the week of the 20th. Not that I need to be giving poker degens the home court advantage…
15,@DocGables @hourglass_nft Are you threatening me?
16,"@MVillameta @DiscoverXnft @hourglass_nft Honestly, as long as he keeps @DSMShark from ever reaching the top of the leaderboard I don’t even care."
17,@DiscoverXnft @hourglass_nft Dude you don’t understand. I am NOT good.
18,"Key takeaway from first day of the @hourglass_nft game release and seeing everyone share their winnings:

I am worse at poker than I thought. ☠️"
19,@DiscoverXnft @atari No wait I’m not ready we haven’t memed Pixelmon back above mint yet what do I do
20,Texas HODL 'Em is basically draw poker for cheaters. Doesn't get much more degen than that. 😅 So stoked to already have this released to our holders. More on the way! https://t.co/mbe4uCWzom
21,@DocBrownLloyd @BoredApeYC Doc would have definitely been a Steward in The Society of the Hourglass. @hourglass_nft https://t.co/c0NZmta5nW

31,"No judgement on anyone else that is selling. Everyone’s situation is different. I’m hoping, though, that by sharing this we can have some discourse around the right way to handle these kinds of situations. As long as we keep supporting teams like this, they’re not going away. ✅"
32,"Riding a 3 ETH mint to zero feels bad, but not as bad as asking someone else to finish the ride for me. That’s not how we being more people into the space. 🧵"
33,"This kind of thing is not only bad for those of us who minted, or anyone who bought on secondary, but for the space as a whole. 🧵 https://t.co/kqVbZu3l7c"
34,"I’ve cut my losses on things before, but this feels different. If the founder shows up and delivers something, maybe I’ll change my mind. For now, though, I can’t dump this on someone. 🧵"
35,"I have prided myself on transparency and doing the right thing. At this point, knowing what we know about the reveal, purchased Unity assets passed off as their own work, etc., selling would equate to me asking someone to hold my bag. 🧵"
36,Why I’m not selling my @Pixelmon. 🧵

39,RT @Signalnoise: We never manufactured “hype” when promoting @STARKADEworld. Hype can be misleading… there are loads of examples out there.
40,"@DiscoverXnft If all these degens can get Hapebeast to an 8 ETH floor pre-reveal, they can get Pixelmon back above mint so I can wipe the blood off my face and walk away whole."
41,"A Founder’s Story: The Autobiography of Me

*Focuses on building and looking to the future. Hype is dangerous.*

*Misses collecting, wants to degen for a hot minute.*

*Looks at Twitter. Looks at Discord.*

Finds “the one.” LFG. 🚀

*Mints Pixelmon.* 🪦

44,"Every household name and major IP starts as an idea. The difference between web3 and what came before is where the ideas are coming from.

So many great NFT communities—like @jenkinsthevalet, @nuclearnerds, and @hourglass_nft (+others)—are paving the way. 🤝"
45,@DiscoverXnft Not sure what everyone is fudding about. I minted this one and it looks awesome. https://t.co/rw3Xmnj27C

60,@Shot2TheMoon @hourglass_nft Had a blast. Thanks for having me!
61,@fccview Something that drains the funds from the contract of any lazy derivative cash grab and redistributed it to teams that actually care.

81,"Seeing people get so excited about what we’re building at @hourglass_nft is humbling and exciting. In a market full of things that don’t make sense, passionate people aligning to create together is particularly special."
