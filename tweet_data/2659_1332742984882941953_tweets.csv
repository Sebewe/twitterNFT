62,"@Bxn_W I been calling proper price action in crypto markets for 3 months and got the receipts to prove it lol, so have you though. Everyone else calling alt season again when eth pumps 5% lmfao 🤣"
63,@Bxn_W Yeah but they aren’t “traders”. They never learned proper technical analysis. To them it’s fairy dust. I’d argue to say they don’t know proper fundamentals either. Throwing money at every dip doesn’t take a wizard
64,"@Bxn_W Big facts, 95% of these nft/crypto traders in twitter can’t read a chart. Prove me wrong"
