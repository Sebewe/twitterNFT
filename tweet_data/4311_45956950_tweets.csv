10,@fvckrender's  FVCK_Crystals may be the best buy on the market right now. Each crystal gets you one FREE FVCK_Avatar on release PLUS One Mint spot at a discount if you want two instead! Getting three Fvckrender pieces for under 3 ETH? Can't think of better alpha (I own 3)
11,@Loopifyyy I bought into their Kickstarter 7 years ago. Still waiting 😅

14,@fvckrender Holy shit I hope I get this one
15,@fvckrender Wait this is so sick
16,@nobodyrado Oh God I said the no no word
17,@nobodyrado Mostly just TX that fail or sit and never confirm. Or contract interactions that fail for many random reasons. Maybe it's metamask gas issues

60,@tommyk_eth Lol
61,@AbdeIQader In my opinion. But I'm not a financial advisor and that's not financial advice
62,@AbdeIQader Sell and harvest your tax losses
63,"@SvengardHoek As it currently stands I agree. It would take a *lot* of real volume to bring $LOOKS back to the price it once was

However, in the future, if the real volume stays up and steadily grows, buying back in at a lower price point is probably not a bad idea. Time will tell"
64,"@Chopsss13 Until then though, I stand by my statements and still think it's a good time to sell and wait"
65,"@Chopsss13 Yeah I saw that. They are putting in the work and I'm giving props where props are due. Who knows, maybe I'll buy back in mid/late P3"
66,"Look I'm still currently bearish on the $LOOKS token as the wash trading volume and rewards start to sharply decrease in the next phase

79,@4oreverTrash I like LooksRare and I literally hope you're right. But as it stands the math doesn't make sense
80,"@4oreverTrash Stakes partially, dumps the rest. Did you even look at the TX? $LOOKS is down just over 50% since Phase 2 started Feb 10th. Directly in line with wash trading rewards halving. Phase 3 will likely follow suit"
81,"@boredodino We currently all benefit because it's still profitable. When it becomes unprofitable, those rewards go away. $LOOKS has already followed suit with a price drop of over 50% since Phase 2 started Feb 10th. When Phase 3 starts May 5th I think it will happen again and even worse"
82,"@TildaPricedin @MERKZY_YT @m00neth @BlueBadger2600 @LooksRareNFT It becomes a problem in phase 3 when wash trading becomes unprofitable, and all those ""redistributed"" fees disappear overnight"
