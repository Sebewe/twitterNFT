15,"@mattysino @aeyakovenko this is so right, we can only push and prod and cajole here (unless we want to encourage nuclear war). statesman and businessman are not the same. need to support Russians not go to war with them"

78,"@CoinBitty @mattysino why cash out?  can’t they sell for and buy in crypto / stablecoin, spin up their own. crypto = medium of exchange &amp; these r cunning types - FSB already connected? (yes issues of scale, who will accept etc) but poss in principal, no?"
