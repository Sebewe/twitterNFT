0,@avichal @ElectricCapital Congrats!
1,"From a tweet 2 days ago, to Starlink activation in Ukraine hours later, and delivery of terminals 48hrs later. Just amazing. https://t.co/Wjjnutd0cJ"
2,I continue to believe that this is one of the greatest developments of the past few years. It'll give the US and the West a remarkable strategic advantage in the decades to come. #Bitcoin  https://t.co/lBl9rJymQo
3,RT @JimLaPorta: New @AP reporting tonight: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was asked to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the U.S. gov…
4,Hard not to be madly inspired by the bravery and fierceness of Ukrainians. Their resistance and fighting spirit is truly exemplary.
5,"Excellent piece from @DavidSacks. Worth a weekend read, and more importantly actively rejecting this dangerous trend. https://t.co/97q77t3md1"
6,"@martinvars Yes totally. You know this better than most given 🇦🇷. To your point, when money can be manipulated, it always is, sometimes for good reasons and with good outcomes. Most times with tragic outcomes for people."
7,"@martinvars The point (mainly for #Bitcoin) is that the supply and economics are pre-determined and guaranteed with code, so yes there’s volatility now but no one can mess with the “physics” of the underlying asset, and that to me has a ton of value. Savings only go one way with fiat🔻"
8,"An action always creates a reaction. In this case it will take a while to see the full effects of it, but we will look back at this decision as a turning point. The financial system must be designed to protect against criminal activity AND authoritarianism https://t.co/OEjKMOYm2A"
9,@udiWertheimer 😂 indeed
10,@DanGrover “insert disc 12 of 22”.
11,"It occurred to me that a small, dwindling % of people regularly using Disk Image files on a Mac have actually ever experienced ejecting a physical disk(ette). Most people happily ""eject"" virtual ones away never wondering about the origins of this ritual."
12,🍸@RamsNFL! So well deserved!
13,This halftime show screamed “we’re back!” to me.
14,@brian_armstrong It was brilliant. Truly.
15,@emiliemc So awesome 👏
16,"Much has been said about inflation (now 7.5%, but likely higher). It turns out that when you print non-stop &amp; ignore supply chain issues, it becomes a thing 🤷🏻‍♂️. Now that we’re here though, inflation with growth is likely better than a recession. Don’t mess it up both ways please."
17,"@agarwal @zack @asuth @GrowSF That’s the only way indeed. Thanks for doing the hard, right work."
18,"@mr_pixelr @EmSheDoesIt I hope you’re right. It would be great. But that wasn’t my point. No matter how many hours you work a day, we still spend a considerable % of our lives working. Doing it alone/virtually and not having as many irl experiences is what I was talking about."
19,@zack @asuth The only path is a change of leadership and ideology. That means voting in people with common sense and a desire to work hard to address these issues at their core.
20,"@zack @asuth I know you’re coming from a very good place with this OpEd. I felt that way years ago, joined Tipping Point, and have come to the realization that no amount of money or skilled time spent on these issues can outweigh the absurd policies wreaking havoc across the Bay Area."
21,"@karengeier Sure. If you can be productive while walking your dog in a park, enjoy it fully."
22,"@EmSheDoesIt I think it’s a false dichotomy. You can’t spend all your day with friends unless you do nothing. We spend 8+ hours a day focused on work. Being alone at home in front of a screen, vs. interacting with other humans irl is what I’m talking about."
23,"@the_blueprint I probably did the kind of work you can’t even imagine, including sleeping on the floor of my office while building my startups. Have you tried that? Not very comfortable. That idea that work is horrible unless you’ve already made it is comically nonsensical."
24,@RuthKapelus All part of life! Although microwaving fish… won’t be missed.
25,"@ideafaktory I hope you’re right, but I worry about geographic inadequacy of talent pools. Not sure you’ll be able to build competitive companies based on living preferences vs. these who will focus on finding the best talent irrespective of location."
26,"@michaelperry Totally. It would be great to find a better balance. Hybrid is way harder to figure out vs. in person or fully remote, though."
27,"It just hit me that a good chunk of this next generation coming into the workforce might never experience the joys of collaborating with colleagues in a vibrant workplace, sharing coffee, after work drinks, … Sad to imagine so many people looking at screens all day."
28,Bad policies =&gt; bad outcomes. https://t.co/ijeY6EzzRl
29,@JulienGattoni I was in Switzerland when it happened. The major difference is that a big part of these programs included weaning addicts off of substance abuse vs. facilitating usage without any quid pro quo. SF has become an addict’s paradise. It’s full service.
30,@adamnash @DaffyGiving @RibbitCapital @xyz_vc @coinbase Congrats!
31,I’m really sad about SF becoming the world’s epicenter of failed radical progressive ideology. The most remarkable aspect of this blind spiraling fall is the inability to learn from past mistakes and instead doubling down on non-sensical aberrant policies. https://t.co/0zBBWbQVU6
32,Couple more. https://t.co/U682SpQn16
33,"I have never seen SF this empty and sad. Boarded up storefronts, empty streets. This part of town used to be really busy pre-COVID. https://t.co/Ugevi4RZ6h"
34,@HarryStebbings Buying my first Bitcoin.
35,I wish the people using all their energy to rewrite the past would instead focus on making our collective future brighter.
36,"Many people are speaking up about SF’s jarring disastrous policies, but very few have done the work to offer concrete plans to address the crisis this once beautiful city is facing. Thank you for your service @ShellenbergerMD. https://t.co/w3gqshODYz"
37,"Inspiring to see Coinbase continue to lead on important matters such as culture (leave politics and non-work related matters at home), and now the role of companies vs. the law in content moderation / account removal, aka censorship. For the record, I’m a fan of both. https://t.co/OqhnavTYwH"
38,Finally some reason. This interview is worth a read. Their logic behind ending restrictions despite rising cases seems sound. They distinguish hospitalizations *for* COVID vs. those for other reasons with a random positive test. https://t.co/AaBmvuIIhN
39,"@RaphAuer @ccatalini @ddisparte Thanks @RaphAuer, I’m not much of a consolation prize kind of guy, but I appreciate the sentiment."
40,@VinnyLingham I’m highly skeptical.
41,@muneeb Congrats!
42,"People probably age at an accelerated rate when they lose the ability to listen, learn, and be curious about what the next generation thinks and believes in."
43,@mosseri Totally unacceptable.
44,This accelerating trend of pushing for only one accepted view about a given topic and the desire to censor any nuanced opposing view even in the form of a conversation is something we should all be extremely worried about. https://t.co/FpX0HkYtNM
45,@zooko No apology needed! Hope to see you around soon.
46,"@zooko 👋 @zooko, long time. Nothing weird here. At the time Libra was started, it made sense to attempt building a stable asset on top of a high-performance purpose-built payments blockchain. Experience increased my appreciation for true decentralization &amp; censorship resistance."
47,@yoniassia That happened a long time ago. The infection rate has continued to accelerate over time though.
48,@altcap I wish! 😂
49,"#Bitcoin is truly leaderless, censorship resistant, and has much greater network effects. In essence, it’s unique and cannot ever be replicated. Its creation truly was the Big Bang event of crypto. 2/2"
50,"It’s become clear to me that #Bitcoin will be the one asset and L1 still around in 20+ years with increased compounding relevance over time. The #2 slot (for a different use case) is still tbd. #Ethereum is in the lead for now, but #Solana and others nipping at their heels. 1/2"
51,"I’m very much pro-vax, but I really believe that changing the definition of fully vaccinated to boosted individuals at a time when so many people got the free Omicron “booster”, and many countries are lifting restrictions is wrong. https://t.co/bm4bhSXIx4"
52,@schrep @adamnash Amazing!
53,"Here's to yet another chapter with a maybe more ""acceptable"" promoter driving the vision forward. There will be ample time in the future for me to properly reflect on the behavior of certain politicians and regulators along the way, but for now... onward!"
54,"Congrats to my former colleagues and friends, as well as to @silvergatebank. We all gave our whole hearts, blood, sweat and tears to what I will always call Libra. We were mission driven and were in it for the right reasons (that remain as valid today as they were then). https://t.co/UcRdYsfmMH"
55,@emiliemc @tobi @coinbase Congrats! Awesomeness all around.
56,@loic Duh.
57,@Situwasian It’s just that they resent colleagues and others being successful with something they were very wrong about. The cost of them admitting their short sightedness is just too high for them at this point so they double down.
58,@gaborgurbacs Totally. All of these deserve to be a (cheap) NFT collection.
59,"It’s fascinating to watch “experts” / crypto skeptics, pop their heads out every time there’s a market correction with more bombastic headlines. We get it, it would pain you so much to be wrong that you won’t let facts get in the way of the ideology. https://t.co/fqsRq3hfX5"
60,@dumbcontract2 😂 the bangers are all mine and I’m just getting started.
61,@lunato1000 Might be true. But boy do I love that 1%.
62,I’ve never felt this connected to a community of builders like the crypto/web3 one. I’m not talking about folks who are in it for a quick speculative win. I’m talking about people who want to rebuild the internet’s infrastructure to move value and power in the hands of people.
63,"@JerryCap To start: trust, money/value movement, digital ownership, governance, tokenization of assets of all kinds, “open finance”. Each of these can have a profound positive impact for many and they’re just the tip of the iceberg. So much to do."
64,@arampell @stan_chudnovsky Has to be said with Russian accent.
65,It’s during crypto winters that the best entrepreneurs build the better companies. This is the time again to focus on solving real problems vs. pumping tokens.
66,@rssnft @ensdomains ✅
67,@TheShibaToshi So much. It’s crazy.
68,gm. What did I miss while I was gone?
69,@brexHQ @_karandeep @TCVTech Congrats to all of you!
70,@kevinweil @sriramk @metaportal Worth noting that @kevinweil’s nickname for me in Messenger is “Togo’s addict”.
71,"👋 2021. Here’s to a fulfilling and meaningful 2022! While we still live in uncertain turbulent times, I can’t help being optimistic for what’s ahead."
72,"Congrats to the entire @truebill team! As a fan of this crew from the early hours, I couldn't be happier for this great outcome happening to great people. https://t.co/Bdp1XYiXRy"
73,PSA to new founders out there given current market conditions: one of startups’ superpowers is scarcity and the clarity and focus that comes with the constant fear of running out of $. Pre product market fit gluttony almost inevitably leads to failure.
74,Congrats @hbarra! Game changer! https://t.co/kVhmKMezC6
75,@DaveLeeFT Full and unequivocal support.
76,@realJacobJed Trust. Which is kind of a big deal.
77,"It’s amazing to see significant tech leaders get into the crypto/web3 rabbit hole and come out on the other side with bored apes profile pics, .eth usernames and crypto lingo. What an awesome time to be alive. wagmi for sure!"
78,@tobi OMG. gm indeed.
79,@cdixon I concur.
80,Probably nothing. Let’s keep printing and spending so efficiently. https://t.co/NF6audmpix
81,@wcathcart @novi @WhatsApp Thanks for the amazing partnership over the last few years @wcathcart &amp; team. It’s been truly awesome 🙏.
82,"Another small step in the right direction. Today, we’re starting the rollout of the @novi wallet in @WhatsApp in the 🇺🇸. On a personal level, this is the best farewell gift from the best team ever! https://t.co/6jk4NO60wv"
83,Thanks for sharing your story @garrytan. The American Dream continues to be alive and well if we believe in it and give it an earnest shot. The idea that success can only be the result of exploitation is ideologically flawed to its core. https://t.co/KulQdjzIkU
84,"RT @skasriel: Today, we’re starting to test Split Payments, giving people an easy way to share the cost of bills and expenses. Expect to se…"
85,@tfadell @HarperCollins @HarperBusiness @PenguinUKBooks Pre-ordered and can't wait to read it.
86,@btaylor @salesforce Congrats!
87,I now look forward to having more free time in the months to come before I start building something new and exciting again. Onward! (7/7)
88,"I’m incredibly grateful to Mark for the opportunity and privilege to share a bit of the journey over the years. I’ll keep lifelong memories and friendships from my time at the company, and I wish it well in the years to come. (6/7)"
89,"I’ll keep a special place in my heart for some of the most fun and stimulating years of my life building Messenger with so many talented people. In turn, the Novi years were the most mission-driven and intellectually stimulating ones. (5/7)"
90,"I find comfort and confidence in knowing that they will continue to execute our important mission well under @skasriel’s leadership, and I can’t wait to witness this from the outside. I know there’s greatness ahead. (4/7)"
91,"The one thing I’m the proudest of during my time here is the amazing kickass team we’ve assembled over the last three years. This is the most resilient, passionate, determined and talented group of humans I’ve ever worked with. (3/7)"
92,While there’s still so much to do right on the heels of launching Novi — and I remain as passionate as ever about the need for change in our payments and financial systems — my entrepreneurial DNA has been nudging me for too many mornings in a row to continue ignoring it. (2/7)
93,"Personal news: after a fulfilling seven years at Meta, I’ve made the difficult decision to step down and leave the company at the end of this year. (1/7)"
94,@caesars @singh_sequoia @Sequoia_India @arboworks Congrats!
95,@loic So much to learn about for sure!
96,"@loic I agree that it comes with risk too, and these need to be mitigated. But the next decade is going to see more innovation in that space than the last century and it’s incredibly exciting."
97,"The level of financial empowerment of this generation coming into the workforce is truly unprecedented and likely historic. Really encouraging to see what DeFi and the likes of Robinhood combined with Discord, Reddit and YouTube is doing for financial literacy."
98,@dens @argobot 💯 great analogy. Where we are now with Web3 and crypto definitely feels like WAP/J2ME era of mobile.
99,"Inflation at 6.2% means that if we keep it steady for 10 years, your $100,000 will become $54,800 by then. Compounding is a powerful force. Satoshi is having 🍿 somewhere right now. #Bitcoin https://t.co/THtshLF1Y0"
