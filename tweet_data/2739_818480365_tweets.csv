3,"he waves over the guy currently at the front of house and he comes to direct me to a seat at the end of the bar. i said ok cool can i use the bathroom before i sit? he says no problem.

34,"@Ape149 @BoredApeYC @yugalabs @DrifterShoots we can have a ride called “bull market/bear market” where it goes fast then slow then fast then slow, alternating until completion"
35,@economist @CRYPTOALBATROSS @JenkinsMutated @seeapefollowape @jenkinsthevalet @_miketriumph_ @BoredApeYC @yugalabs ok this is fun.
36,"@Ape149 @BoredApeYC @yugalabs @DrifterShoots from the top of the ride is the only time many of us will get the Vibe Check level views. and then ofc, we must come back down safely. just quickly 😂"
37,@DuquePawlovsky @CRYPTOALBATROSS @_miketriumph_ @BoredApeYC @yugalabs well i cant say i know anything about those events.
38,@Ape149 @BoredApeYC @yugalabs the free fall drop tower ride is dedicated to @DrifterShoots and should be called the Vans Drop Tower (if drift approves) 🤷🏼‍♂️😅
39,@economist @CRYPTOALBATROSS @JenkinsMutated @seeapefollowape @jenkinsthevalet @_miketriumph_ @BoredApeYC @yugalabs oof costume… jenkins is a professional. that is a uniform. https://t.co/yo7RzOVogO

46,@jenkinsthevalet @CRYPTOALBATROSS @_miketriumph_ @BoredApeYC @yugalabs ser we are a very busy and in demand theme park. u have a fleet of drivers wearing THE OFFICIAL uniform parking guests cars to keep it up to speed 🙄😂
47,RT @tmagled: highdea for today: shall we create a DAO to build the @BoredApeYC theme park like harry potter has or will @yugalabs do it?…
48,@CRYPTOALBATROSS @_miketriumph_ @BoredApeYC @yugalabs multiple irl @jenkinsthevalet valet stands with drivers dressed like jenkins

51,RT @Yip_Wil: Hey y’all I have a small  favour to ask! I’m trying to get a jersey from my favourite rookie and @JerseyFlock is going to send…
52,@steveb_crypto @doodles i dont happen to think its all that different
53,@chrisdevlin7700 @CryptoVonDoom @BoredApeYC @VStrangeYUGA @TheTreeverse @Loopifyyy id be perfectly fine with that. i have 2 treeverse plots that i think age very nicely.
54,@Zeneca_33 @doodles yeah fwiw i havent bought one but was curious of the communities POV
55,@BitcoinDaddy69 @doodles but that could be an accident. its not an accident to ignore multiple notices from the project. its not an accident to type in that listing price and then confirm it either.
56,@CRYPTOALBATROSS @_miketriumph_ @BoredApeYC @yugalabs oh this is something. i think the highest tier should be m3ga
57,@ZadChris @GutterCatGang gm!
58,@BitcoinDaddy69 @doodles where do we draw the line between mistake and just not caring to read the obvious?
59,@CRYPTOALBATROSS @_miketriumph_ @BoredApeYC @yugalabs adidas will build and supply our basketball courts for the shooting competitions.
60,@ThatParlayGuy @BoredApeYC @yugalabs i very very very rarely remember any of my dreams
61,@ThatParlayGuy @BoredApeYC @yugalabs oh yes u have definitely thought of this before 😂
62,@_miketriumph_ @BoredApeYC @yugalabs hmm. how about “dog walk” a nice slow ride that takes u through a scenic section. for children mostly.
63,@mikethreezy ok now do that on r6 siege
64,@mikethreezy https://t.co/WN5nfrdswl
65,@CryptoVonDoom @BoredApeYC @VStrangeYUGA reads this tweet and immediately… https://t.co/OdIq27w8Zw
66,highdea for today: shall we create a DAO to build the @BoredApeYC theme park like harry potter has or will @yugalabs do it? 🤷🏼‍♂️😂
67,@HPaulson_ @doodles thanks 🤝
68,@HPaulson_ @doodles fwiw i wasnt a buyer of one but just curious of the communities POVs
69,"@HPaulson_ @doodles again, hard to do. i would never be that careless with a 10 eth asset to not know after multiple warnings that id list it for say 5 or 7 eth."
70,@allegeddegen @shoeb_ot @doodles would work for me tbh.
71,@HPaulson_ @doodles but negligence removes the word accident from the equation to me.
72,@corporatetrash1 bbc https://t.co/Gcyu3dNbNy
73,@MattFeinbergEsq @doodles 5 eth is less than 50% floor. it would be shocking for someone to go about it that way.
74,@shoeb_ot @doodles i like the honesty 🤝
75,@MattFeinbergEsq @doodles doodles got this feature that wraps ur doodle and adds a spaceship (see: space doodles) however this is not a new nft separate from ur doodle. selling this = selling the doodle. few ppl sold super low last night (5-7 eth) not realizing but it was well explained. so here we are.
76,@rfdzee @fallenflowerLLC @doodles mine just being tmagled.eth lol
77,@fallenflowerLLC @rfdzee @doodles oh i was joking about the doodle lol. i wouldnt say no to a free painting tho 🤷🏼‍♂️
78,@704Saints @ABigThingBadly @doodles yeah just seeing what people thought about this specific instance.
79,@rfdzee @fallenflowerLLC @doodles someone pls send me doodle
80,"@DaBunnyOFFICIAL @NateAlexNFT he didnt like my reply 😔

he usually does… no bueno"
81,@MutantAurelius @doodles 🤝
82,@DarthFib @dagg3rhigh @doodles i havent bought one fwiw i was curious what people thought.
83,@louachu2 @doodles absolutely makes sense to me. and i appreciate that u wouldnt just turn on someone because u dont agree exactly.
84,@louachu2 @doodles fwiw i havent. but interesting to see everyones POV
85,@KeepinItGutta @gtumolo @doodles im asking the hard questions this morning 😅
86,@rfdzee @doodles 💀😂
87,@MattFeinbergEsq @doodles not sure i understand what u mean
88,@AmbientApe @dagg3rhigh @doodles one can argue karma isnt real. many good people have bad things happen to them undeservingly. we cant only attribute it to karma when someone “got what they deserved” imo
89,"@MutantAurelius @doodles thats fair. thats why i posted, i appreciate others POVs"
90,"@dagg3rhigh @doodles but i wouldnt do this, so its hard to be like “wish this wouldnt happen to me”"
91,"@MutantAurelius @doodles no i feel that is different as well, but i see what ur saying with that example. when someone rushes to list their item, which has had clear explanation from the project themselves (so i hear from other doodles members) and messes up i dont feel its the same as being scammed."
92,"@MutantAurelius @doodles not if they are ignoring announcements and info from doodles themselves. thats owner negligence.

thats not the same as the unlikely example u presented, imo."
93,@MutantAurelius @doodles well this seems like a beyond extreme and unlikely scenario. like a 0.01% type scenario.
94,"@RustySailor_ @jenkinsthevalet @seeapefollowape ofc. our love can never be argued, we paid the ultimate price to be at the superbowl 😂🙌🏻"
95,@RustySailor_ @jenkinsthevalet @seeapefollowape and the bengals
96,@YatMaxi @doodles yeah i know thats what i mean. so does that clear me if i scooped one lol?
97,@SDfromthelou @ABigThingBadly @doodles this is true lol
98,@SDfromthelou @ABigThingBadly @doodles lol i was today years old when i learned about nftnerds
99,@ABigThingBadly @doodles oh the gamble… 😭
