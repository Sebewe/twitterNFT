4,"@ischafer Bummer, there used to be a DWR Outlet in Secaucus, but it closed. Same with one we had outside of DC."
5,"@ischafer Have you tried looking on the DWR Outlet on eBay? I've bought half my furniture from there — it's the BEST. Some ""scratch &amp; dent"" stuff (noted, with photos), but mostly returns, overstock, or open box items. Always lots of Herman Miller chairs. https://t.co/Tb0YZGt338"
6,"@WashProbs @levainbakery, and it’s not even close."
7,"@bradnelson @Lobby3D I should clarify further: so in this instance, the “outsized influence” I’m referring to is within the lobbying firm itself. AFAIK, bad actors could buy up a ton of tokens (effectively, voting rights) to influence the firm’s key strategic decisions."
8,@dukki @Lobby3D It’s like Bored Ape Yacht Club and giving away commercial rights to Ape holders — what happens when someone decides to use an Ape as the mascot for their hate group?
9,"@dukki @Lobby3D I applaud experimentation and this in theory is very interesting, but every time I ask about how they (DAOs in general, not specifically Yang) safeguard against bad actors, I tend to get crickets."
10,RT @gabealonso: Retweeting for a signal boost - super curious on the answers here…
11,"@bradnelson @Lobby3D This wouldn’t be a “political contribution.” It’s not a super PAC (yet). This DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is intended to function like a lobbying firm to advocate for web3. Buying tokens in this scenario is like buying shares in said firm, with voting rights."
12,"Andrew Yang is launching @Lobby3D, a web3 lobbying DAO, with three tiers of tokens, 0.07 - 40 ETH for varying degrees of access and perks.

Can someone who knows DAOs help me understand: what prevents bad actors (domestic or foreign) from literally buying outsized influence? https://t.co/TPy0kpd1qx"

In the anon world of web3, we've done a pretty poor job of humanizing the artists without whom there would be no NFTs. ""Becoming @AkuDreams"" is @Micah_Johnson3's origin story, dropping today on @artifex_project. https://t.co/Vdvs9rkVUq"
