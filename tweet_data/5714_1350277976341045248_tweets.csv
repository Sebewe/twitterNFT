33,"@NicoleBehnam Hi Nicole. I first began researching crypto in 2020, watching hours of youtube and searching google. I am invested in some coins/projects &amp; I have found it to be an exciting opportunity for growth in so many ways. I would love to discuss what you need in a research assistant."

38,"I am here to explore my interests, to share my experiences, and to promote resiliency in this space. Every environment has its challenges, for which we need to be prepared - physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. We are all leaders in this space. We all make an impact."
39,"I have learned that my success cannot be defined by anyone else's experiences or expectations because when I compare myself to others or work to please others, I am not being true to myself. The best way I can help myself, and others, is to be my authentic self &amp; speak my truth."
40,"Those times when I felt defeated and walked away from something, often - unexpectedly - I was led to something more fulfilling. I believe this happened because I aligned my actions with my values."
41,"I have been ""making it"" for 45 years in this world, in many different environments. I have not always been successful by my own definition at the time, but I have been continuously learning &amp; developing. I have even ""given up"" a few times, when my situation seemed unfit for me.🧵"

48,"I speak from experience. I have failed forward. I encourage exploration. I love unconditionally… and fiercely. I do have some stories. Much of my experience is founded in failure, which represents a different level of success. I am a seeker of truth and harmony in life and love."
49,"I wanted to prove to the world that women are more than a pretty face - we are smart, and capable, and sexual, and sensual. I may not have proven that notion to the world or to my parents, but my experiences allowed me to connect with my kids on an entirely different level. (4/?)"
50,"I was smart, but I was sassy. I reached for the stars. I swung for the fences. I was experimental. I wanted to explore every notion and understand everything on a deeper level than did my parents. I was perpetually evolving to the circumstances of a rapidly changing world. (3/?)"
51,"But I rebelled. I was a free spirit, not to be contained. I was curious. I wanted to know about the world and my existence, my feelings, my thoughts, my desires. I wanted to understand if others felt the same. I wanted to explore life and love. I have never played it safe (2/?)"
52,"👣 TruthBeTold, my past is full of lessons, most of which I learned the hard way. I am grateful for the insights I gained by challenging perspectives, breaking boundaries, and forging my own path, however painful it was at any given moment. My parents tried to protect me…(1/?)"

56,"I have missed so many pivotal moments in my life because I was looking for what I thought I wanted rather than what was right before me. In life, in love, longing only leaves you empty. Fill your life with all that is right there waiting for you. Live in the moment, with love. ❤️"
