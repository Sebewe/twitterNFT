64,@projectwealth18 @garyvee No doubt 🤜🏼
65,@projectwealth18 @garyvee You’re definitely right. But I think he shines a bright light on NFTs and its utility and future application. All of his purchases are public knowledge via ether scan regardless of whether he shouts them out on twitter or not.
66,@projectwealth18 @garyvee He regularly pumps projects after he gets his bags. But overall I think he does more good than harm for the NFT community.

84,@sartoshi_nft Yeah but think about NFTs impact on your car’s extended warranty @sartoshi_nft
85,It seems like current NFT culture embodies the gas fee. Sweeping floors costs racks in gas- people like to flex that.
