2,"@VirtualElena Another primitive: Post NFTs! 

Being able to buy artists' posts early on funds them while also allowing people to share in the upside.

Will be very interesting to see what happens when social feeds and NFTs combine.

11,@jessewldn Check us out @nfposts_eth! We're building a twitter-like web3 social network where every post is an NFT... so they can be traded. Profiles are completely on-chain so your network becomes an asset you own. Social tokens should be NFTs!
12,"@liamjgoss Correct. But even though we use Polygon, you’ll still see your ENS name from mainnet on NFPosts"
13,"@liamjgoss Thanks! And yes, but we'll be whitelisting some people who've tried out the testnet version too"
14,"@ryanalex_eth @dhof @lootproject They’re similar to social tokens. There’s a limited supply of someone’s NFPs since they can only post so much. If they become more popular in the future, their NFPs would become more valuable too. So small creators can sell their NFPs to their supports, who could benefit later."
15,"gm to all nfp early adopters

NFT: https://t.co/Sw4eHYHjg5"
16,@ryanalex_eth @dhof @lootproject I have! The nfts actually have a similar tokenURI to @dhof's project. The nft's image is generated inside tokenURI with the on-chain content and returned in the form of an svg
17,"@ryanalex_eth I'm not sure. If you want to checkout @Kleros_io though, they're doing very interesting work that could be useful"
18,"@ryanalex_eth For now it will be moderated internally like OS. Over time it'll be transitioned to a more open moderation that involves the community and a DAO. There are multiple ways that this could be done including delegating moderation, prediction markets, etc. Lots of research to do!"
19,"@ryanalex_eth Moderating will work similar to how other platforms that display nfts moderate (like OpenSea). Can't delete the nft but can hide it in the frontend. Of course, the nft would still be there so other frontends could display it"
20,"@ryanalex_eth Thanks! For now we take care of pinning the data. However the actual text in the posts, following, and likes are actually on-chain so they don’t need to be pinned"

22,"What’s a Non Fungible Post?

It’s a new #NFT primitive for posts. NFPs are the future of non fungible social tokens.

Soon you’ll be able to collect the NFPs of your favorite community members.

23,"@balajis This comes by building a social graph on Ethereum + Layer 2 (follow eth addresses), so the network is permanent and belongs to you. This is what we're doing at BitProfile. Anyone else can come and build a great social network website using the on-chain connections."
