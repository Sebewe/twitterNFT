And I consider you a valued friend here."
6,"@TullamoreDEWUS Not only have I heard of it, I have passed through it on my way to Birr and then Lorrha to see family."
7,@boredapebot @BoredApeYC Zombie eyes…. So clean. https://t.co/n8lwiEnBqd
8,@kingkong45_eth Love this Ape!  Great pick up.

10,@CryptokidKid What a great name too…. Damn.
11,@CryptokidKid Who did we all miss?!
12,"@Stoniphantom @GutterCatGang I wonder if I’m in there because my last remaining cat is in my vault but the others are in another wallet.  I’m guessing they may have missed it, but who knows."
13,"@ShrewdCharlie Oh good, I thought I was the only one…. 🤦🏻‍♂️"
14,"A legend who will never be forgotten at Elland Road, or here in NY.

One day I will coach my infant son, and I will use Bielsa’s style as the way to play the beautiful game.

16,"@90min_Football They would be better off with their starting striker, CM, and CB/Captain back.  Not making excuses but it’s hard to play top level teams without your top level talent for the most of the year."
17,@Spotonparts 100%.  Dan will always answer questions and is willing to help new stables.
18,@hannahxLufc So sorry for you and your family’s loss.
19,"Marcelo will forever be a legend at @LUFC.  

There is no Premier League without him.

There is no hope without him.

There is no wonder without him.

20,"@J_ArthurWhite I know you liked “Tomorrowland”.  

Don’t lie."
21,"@MacedoRanch Honestly don’t know.  Been waiting for the confirmation, but sounds like it will be soon enough."
22,"@MacedoRanch Looking at other offspring is a good indicator.  The breeding algo reset is going to be interesting, so it's hard to take a guess at what to do going forward.  If they do pass traits down, then win % and distance preference may come more into play."
23,"@economist It's like most things.  People feel pretty strongly about something they don't fully understand or know, and then they're let down when it doesn't turn out the way they thought.  Everyone wants instant rather than wait and see any more."
24,@ShrewdCharlie Gang Mother F*ing Gang! 🖤❤️
25,"@grantpat @GutterCatGang My boy!  Well, close to him.... https://t.co/12pjrs4Mpz"
26,@economist @Stoniphantom @GutterCatGang @PUMA Don't go getting all technical on us now that you're in your 40's too @economist 🤣🤣
27,@katlynkatsock @DegenToonz Have seen a few pop up.  The art is pretty sweet with them.
28,@dragonseller88 @BYOPills https://t.co/QwB7twTzJe
29,"@RudyArnold82 @BoredApeYC I will call you a fellow Ape, nothing more and nothing less.  Once an Ape, always an Ape.  Congratulations on the sale!"
30,@Stoniphantom @GutterCatGang @PUMA Have to agree.... https://t.co/JDa5SuFieU
31,"@ShrewdCharlie Congratulations on the sale!  Once an Ape, always an Ape!"
32,@JohnTerry26 @BoredApeYC #SeeApeFollowApe Them’s the rules!  Welcome to the club!
33,"@carvethedegen @BoredApeYC #SeeApeFollowApe Them’s the rules!  First time seeing you, so followed now."
34,"@itsdanataylor Just go with the mantra I use every day with every one, especially those I don’t personally know: 

Fuck’em."
35,@luckyape_eth Haha I've been one lucky Ape/Gang Gang!
36,@luckyape_eth Probably any one of these.... https://t.co/KE7E58NyYC
37,"@RillaProspers Just grabbed some @BYOPills land....  Not financial advice, but always feel land is a good idea."
38,@economist It's what we do.... 🤦‍♂️ haha
39,"@economist Welcome to the club!  4 ahead of you, so can say it only gets better....

Except for waking up more....  👀"

41,"Watching people selling Apes all day and wondering what’s going on has been interesting.

And then this hits my timeline.

Fingers crossed!

43,@JWeb777 Tougher than any grown man I know.  He’s got this!  Good luck to you all!
44,Proud to be an Ape today and every day since mint!  Glad others are catching on.  #bayc https://t.co/ci0EaGyJ5V
45,@xBenJamminx 🤦🏻‍♂️
46,@friesframe Congratulations to you all!   Twins are fun! ⚡️🎉⚡️
47,"@itsdanataylor No need to regret.  I wished I minted more (did 1 the first night) and bought more (bought 2 a week later) but if I truly regretted it I wouldn’t enjoy the whole experience.  There are tons more NFTS coming out daily, and some just as fun as BAYC with great communities."
48,@itsdanataylor Personally I feel B&amp;W for photography always seems classiest and like it will stand the test of time.
49,RT @zed_run: @SangudoStables 🤠

52,"@BoardApes Because nothing ever makes sense in this space.  You are spot on, but we will never have a way to understand it."
53,@imalexandra_eth You'll always be good enough.  They're just wrong.
54,@atcontino @BoredApeYC #SeeApeFollowApe Them's the rules!  Sweet collection!

57,"@long Rather than Fenway why not go Pesky?  Similar references, but one is more specific…. And I’m a Yankees fan, so would go “Bucky F*cking Dent!!!”"
58,@itsdanataylor I own @TheSandboxGame but @nftworldsNFT are the big play right now.  @BYOPills seem to be gaining steam too.
59,@MrSoror @BoredApeYC Zombie eyes for the win! https://t.co/5tNuCnvS5Q

61,"@natashalfawn @busyasfxck I am the furthest thing from an angel, but was lucky enough to be involved.  I gladly am following you as well!  It does link up so well, and I truly am happy to hear about your recovery!  The more people who hear about it, perhaps the more people we can intro to the need for it."

I’ll ask my nephews how to do it 🤣"

70,@imalexandra_eth Crypto chicks?  👀
71,"@EcsZed This is only if you migrated your NFT’s on OS though, right?  That’s where the interaction stemmed from?"
72,"@CryptoChickSale Whoever bought this, I have another one for you....  https://t.co/c3nKxJCdJs"
73,@natashalfawn @busyasfxck So awesome to hear you’re recovering!  I was a stem cell donor and then a volunteer for transporting it for matches for a few years.  It’s great to read something like this to spread awareness for others to get involved and see why it’s so important.  Glad you’re well!
74,@EriVlc GM!
75,@itsdanataylor Well done and congratulations!  Had a Range 10 years ago and loved the ride of the air suspension.  I’m sure they’re so much comfier now.
76,"@friesframe @JunicsETH @boredapebot Congrats on the sale, but more importantly congratulations on the twins!"
77,@CryptokidKid @hawku_com @zed_run That’s a big purchase…. Well done!

87,@NyjMike Especially after that…. 👀
88,@CapetainTrippy 5 and 5 are the worst numbers to have for a Super Bowl box.... https://t.co/WumPayyFgt
89,"@dev_allo @NftTrader Yea, they really did a great job with @NftTrader and the removal of links.  Any trades I have done have all been through there and it really is simple.  Once someone tells me they had “problems” with it, it’s a sign for a scam."
90,"@dev_allo @NftTrader Yea, that’s what I’ve done and he’s trying to do.  I think it’s a scam, but you never know.  Shame the space is like that now."
91,Anyone have any experience with sudo swap?  Have a buddy working on a trade and with all the scams lately just curious about it.

97,"@kinginthe_nft @EcsZed @zed_run @ITFRacing @triza_13 Not new, but always very happy to find other stables to listen and learn from…. 🐎🤙🏻"
98,@MaddSprings My favorite is when they show you what it “might look like” with altered photos.  Show me the real thing and what I may get into before wasting my time showing up.
