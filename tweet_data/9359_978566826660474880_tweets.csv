I’m unsure how to go about bringing this up in a way where people can understand the importance and opportunity to bring a true privacy option to DeFi. 
What do you think?"
49,"Monero could become a cornerstone of the financial revolution in the world of DeFi by implementing Monero &lt;-&gt; Eth atomic swaps, and packaging it as a mixing service."

Currently we have hard to use mixers like tornado cash and Aztec network."
