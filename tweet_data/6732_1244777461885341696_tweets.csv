39,@itsdanataylor Don’t let the haters bother you. Some of us like seeing women in web3
40,@dinolana_sol Eventually I’ll alpha more on solana projects
41,@niftyhyphy i wonder if has something to do with the whole opensea delisting thing. they are covering gas for the relist which means no one is actually paying the 277 gwei i seen a second ago
42,ETH gas is soooo high today what the heck are yall minting.
43,@offwhitegoku @niftyhyphy That I’m not entirely sure of. As essentially once you move the funds to the card it treats the funds like a prepaid visa.
44,@niftyhyphy @offwhitegoku Yah I’m pretty sure Coinbase has a similar thing too if you’re more comfortable with them. But I use crypto and haven’t had a problem with them yet.
45,@niftyhyphy @offwhitegoku To remedy this whole problem. Use crypto dot com signup for a blue card through them and cash out to card. You also earn up to 6% cash back in CRONOs when you spend off the card
46,@elemin That’s a hard pass from me. The artwork gives me chills.
47,Too true. https://t.co/8DqLADpQHj
