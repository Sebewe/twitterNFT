98,@a_tchuca Sorry had to delete that to a purple name on discord. Hold purple name proportional to the number of adverbs times .42069 you get a secret discord channel. There you can connect your wallet to the Metaverse. There we will have silent discos where there is no sound
99,@a_tchuca If you get three adjectives you can burn them and get an adverb. If you have two adverbs and animals you can trade them in for a dao membership. But if you stake your adverbs you can earn $anml if you can raise enough $anml you can trade it in to get a purple discord name #wagmi
