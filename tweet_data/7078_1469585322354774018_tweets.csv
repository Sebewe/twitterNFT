6,Do pump and dump #NFT exist? 🧐
7,"Bitcoin miners brought in just over $1 billion in revenue during February - still significant subsidy fees but only fraction of miner revenues coming from transaction fees. In short, secondary trading activity of #BTC lower https://t.co/4tNXNWTRWM"
8,"This is the proper way to present: tell them what you’re going to tell them, tell them, and finally tell them again.  For stone-heads who don’t get it, just keep fuk’n telling them again and again and again and again and again and again… https://t.co/R6Jms9rFLd"
9,"@iamDCinvestor It’s not u being in tech or crypto, it’s just the current way of life with social media, twitter — we absorb n tolerate now only short bursts, nothing longer (why did that sound dirty)"
10,@Blockworks_ Holla
11,Seriously?!!. Still no #quirkies out there that’s going to show me some love??@quirkiesnft
12,"@cryptjoe9 Of course your opinion matters. People need to understand and appreciate its value for it to happen. End of the day, you are the consumer and that is very important"
13,"@cryptjoe9 More so, bc our #NFTs are now being validated and linked to our irl accounts and information (hopefully securely) in #web3 , the possibility of having our #NFTs literally represent us in #metaverse #web3 worlds becomes even more of a reality"
14,"@cryptjoe9 You will need digital representations of yourself when in the #Metaverse . We r not yet in the Star Wars world of full body holograms so #NFTs - 2d or 3d representations of ourselves in metaverse stores, shops, virtual reality universes - can serve as a bridge to what will become"
15,@cryptjoe9 Except in the #metaverse . It makes perfect sense there
16,"Instinct will tells me to sell this short-term pop in #BTC . This is the highest volatility trading asset in the world by far - more volatile than commodes, FX. I have to trade the moves or else I’m doing the asset a disservice. #notinvestmentadvise #doyourownresearch #mycomments https://t.co/fmn8Xwmofu"
17,@krugermacro Same phenomenon with crypto funds ala @Grayscale vs @GalaxyDigital
18,@krugermacro This is also why long only “smart money” investing exists. Leave the hedge fund “fast money” managers to trade the volatility. Arguably the latter is a dying breed
19,Really??! Only one #quirky likes this tweet in 24 hours? Don’t tell@me @quirkiesnft are weak like that? Show me some likes #quirkies #quirkieslovequirkies #LetsGetQuirky

28,@chadgelina Pretty good looking NFT though
29,"@NicoleBehnam 6. Showing off your portfolio of #NFTS  
7. Pretending that you know where the #cryptocurrency markets are going
8. #shilling your portfolio over and over in order to get some liquidity to sell into 🤷‍♀️🤷🏽🤷🏻‍♂️"
30,@chadgelina How r u having issues with this? You’re teasing
31,"@Keubiko @RealWillyBot Instinct tells you this is a buying opportunity. Reason tells you the same. Conscience, however, is subliminally willing this move to push straight through the bottom, crashes and never to be seen again."
32,@paveldcr @HaileyLennonBTC I think there’s only now a #YellowArmy . #noshill
33,"@BNONews Geez! This will be an #economics class case study across undergrad universities, MBA courses, PhD theses and central bank fireside chats for decades to come. #dontdowar #notworthit #Ukraine #RussieUkraine"
34,"@heimbergecon Well earned. From a trading angle, may be worth to slowly go long rouble. Putin has the keys to nukes which gives him the ultimate leverage to change the course of these discussions to his liking."
35,Being cute and good looking always works. IRL and with #NFTs
36,#NewProfilePic #LetsGetQuirky @quirkiesnft Heard a lot of buzz about this #quirky community. Show your #quirky love if you’re out there https://t.co/7SMNpcEXsc
37,Random thought. True or false. Do we need to realise a #ClimateCrisis in order for the #Metaverse to really flourish? Think virtual #NFT selves in meetings bc it’s too toxic to step outside. It’s an evil thought. But I wouldn’t put it past the self interests of #capitalism
38,@business @nfergus @bopinion One conclusion. There’s too many crazy people in this world
39,"So now what? His currency and economy is on a downward tailspin. But he still has the keys to the nukes. Only now, he has even less to lose by pushing forward. I hope we made the right play here. 🙏🏼 @reuters @cnbc @bloomberg"
40,@bradloncar There is so much to say re: your elitist tweet but let’s focus on 1. US banning #BTC wld b the equivalent of that same US Navy u speak of becoming an antique n no longer able to “keep the world’s waterways free” bc it thought it will always be the most powerful fleet in the world
41,@PuffYatty I see the streeetch resemblance
42,"Derivatives play a big role in #TradFi and is a powerful tool for hedging, trading and portfolio diversification. Will they play the same roles in #NFT ?"
43,"Good reminder that no matter what, good people exists in this world. We hurt just as you do, we are in pain just as you are. @romanyaremchuk_ we stand together with you, my friend. https://t.co/wJIH9N6rE6"

50,I am an equal opportunity discriminator and shitter of shit projects. Don’t take it personally. Most of the tirade is targeted at myself for making bad investment choices.
51,"Just as in the early days of #crypto , only time can separate good #NFT projects from the garbage"

57,"@CozomoMedici NFTs promote the desire for social inclusion into a community - ape, punk, 0x, lion, women, doodles - that gives holders additional social utility, perhaps more social utility and inclusion than they have irl. That is the value of #NFTs 2/2"
58,"@CozomoMedici What is the right lens to look at #NFTs here? Is it from the trad art angle or from a social media context? I would argue there is a lot more social media element to #NFTs that would ultim determine a project’s success, less so the assessment of its “artiness.” 1/2"
59,"@JalenRose No need to spend airtime on haters @JalenRose . #Fabfive #NBA , revived a struggling Indiana Pacers team back to legitimacy, #fearless against the giants #Kobe #AI and held his own, respected voice in sports. You r hated bc you r respected. And u r respected bc u earned it."

62,"@PeterMcCormack @JustinTrudeau This brave stand is commendable. But it didn’t have to come to this. In Ukraine was a country who wanted to join NATO, and now he stands alone. I hope he survives and gives the finger to NATO for not helping him when he and his country were most vulnerable"
63,@tommyk_eth @dingalingts Shit. Am I hating rn? Sucks being human
64,"@tommyk_eth @dingalingts *want see, #web3 still can’t fix mis-spellings."
65,"@tommyk_eth @dingalingts I blame capitalism. But as much as we want to pretend that #web3 #NFT and #crypto is some utopian system where everyone can get along, human psychology and mindset is still just that - human. We r flawed, we r competitive, we went to win at the expense of all"

71,"Floor buying #NFTs vs. rarity trait buying #NFTs . If you pick the right project, floor buying is the better risk reward trade as any project value appreciation would lift floors. Rarity value buying would still be more profitable but have to wait a looong time to realise"
72,@APompliano Makes sense in theory. But must consider the intended purpose and function of the central bank monetary policy. It is based on the ability to control liquidity flows to manage inflation and optimise employment in the #US ie if they can’t control #BTC it ain’t gonna happen
73,#FOMO is what keeps #NFTs alive
74,@AriDavidPaul I hate to say it but agree that markets and market players will ignore the emotions (that’s what traders are trained to do after all) and seek out opportunities and “value trades” like bloodhounds. Makes us less human but it’s just the job. #ruthless

87,Let’s commiserate. Let’s not dismiss. Who cares about the #metaverse #cryptocurrecy or #NFTs when the entire world order is tied in conflict and lives are disrupted. Surviving will become priority. Not buying or selling assets.
88,"People are dying. People will die. Soldiers, men, women, children, babies. These are the realities of political conflicts and war."
89,"We are traders with a mind, but with the eye only on that one goal of making money, we might as well be selfish, soulless robots, fuelled by profits that do not commiserate to the impact of such events."
90,"As people “in the markets” it is our jobs to look at these tragic events like war in Ukraine with a targeted eye towards answering one question, and one question only: “How do I make money with this?”"
91,Just read @SBF_FTX thoughts on today’s Russia-Ukraine events. I respect his humanity and humbled by his suggestion to “do something nice today”. https://t.co/8bQc9wJQ1r
