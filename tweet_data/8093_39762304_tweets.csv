11,"@PANDARlN @WonderPals Oh cool, are you in there @PANDARlN? Any major announcements etc to be aware of?"
12,Is anybody actually in the @WonderPals Discord? Why has this thing I minted last night 17x'd? I have no idea..

Lots of rumours that the SuperBowl is about to be inundated with NFT related advertisements so I suspect some rules will be introduced on this very quickly"
67,"@danlesac This is in no way a defense of what's happened, but rather a genuine question: how does this differ from paying celebrities to advertise products on TV/magazines?

Fanboy time: your music has brought me countless hours of joy over the years. Angles is still a regular album here. V.pleased to have had this brief chat and see you're approaching it with class"
72,"@danlesac Yeah that sounds stupid af tbh. Maybe they're planning to integrate a bridge onto Eth at some point? Total conjecture on my part though. 

@veve_official did similar with their bespoke marketplace migrating onto Immutable X. Their app marketplace is fiat first, kinda...$1 = gem."
73,"@danlesac As for the ""why use ethereum"" - I guess market penetration? I don't know, I don't run the Brits lol. If their end game is to make something enduring then it makes sense to place it onto the most supported network. Adoption of other L1 chains pales in comparison"
74,@danlesac Possibly an issue with a watered down 'tweet take' on something complicated. It reads like it implies Polygon just sends the transactions back to Eth to be processed in the same way as native L1 transactions. Which isn't the case. Rollups are very efficient
75,@danlesac Polygon is proof of stake which is like 1000x more energy efficient than the eth proof of work. It then uses a roll up standard to send all of these transactions in one block to the main ethereum network - blocks that would have been mined anyway. It's a good scaling solution.
76,"@renegademasterr @BoredApeYC @punkscomic @coolcatsnft @GutterCatGang @RumbleKongs @jenkinsthevalet @Deadfellaz @ThePixelmon Feels like just yesterday that a 0.1eth mint price was really pushing your luck.

The most disappointing/sad thing about Pixelmon for me is the choice was with the buyers and they went straight in at 3 eth. The devs played on FOMO to perfection."
