46,"7/ If there is interest from the community, the snapshot should be live in the coming days 🍷

Please share your opinions and vote on the community poll on the forum: https://t.co/aa7fKb35Cd"
47,"6/ Another interesting option might be available if the proposal passes: ""Return $APW to the DAO"" 

This option would allow any $veAPW holders to reduce rewards by voting to send back part of the incentives to Apwine treasury 💰"
48,"5/ It would also allow to decide how much rewards should be allocated on Mainnet and Polygon pools 

To incentivize the users to lock $APW, the LPs and the $tAPW won’t be able to vote on the gauges, only $veAPW holders should get this power 🍇"
49,"4/ The APGP 2 is about allowing $veAPW holders to vote on their favorite pools to influence the rewards distribution 👀 

This could be the beginning of the #APWAR, with projects trying to bribe $veAPW holders to vote for their pools, or even DAOs accumulating &amp; locking $APW 🔥"
50,"3/ During the 1st Winelisting, the rewards were split between 10 pools for 5 IBTs listed on mainnet (&amp; 6 pools for 3 IBTs on Polygon) 

On the 2nd one, it increased to 20 pools on mainnet and 12 on Polygon, which reduced the APR as the same rewards were divided between more pools"
51,"2/ Since the launch, the rewards allocated to PT/Underlying and PT/FYT pools were split equally between eligible pools on the same chain. 

Mainnet and Polygon pools were following the initial emission curve with 625K and 41.6K $APW/month

61,"7/ There is already a proposal published by @StarnyDeFi to allocate some $PSP to farm on @APWineFinance 👀🍇

https://t.co/4CSPwPSbBG"
62,"6/ The grants and contributor budgets also require more details about the framework for now. 

As for the marketing part, Paraswap is hiring, however this shouldn’t stop the DAO for starting community marketing initiatives"
63,"5/ Another interesting possibility announced after the proposal could be @StakeDAOHQ with the upcoming liquid lockers and $veSDT 👀🐘

More informations here: https://t.co/KMQrQLwcUZ"
64,"4/ Some topics need more discussion, for example the Curve war &amp; CVX budget could be switched to gov tokens to diversify with several protocols

@BalancerLabs might be open to a tokenswap, so part of the $PSP could be allocated to $veBAL if both governances decides it 👀"
65,"3/ The idea behind these two programs is to reduce the incentives on mainnet while accumulating more protocol owned liquidity 

Since the feedback/voting period took more time than estimated, and if the team is ready to implement the votes, the budget could start early March"
66,"2/ What’s next ? 

The staking rewards will be reduced to unlock some $PSP for other proposals 🔥

Some of them are still in discussion, but some could be implemented quickly, for example the Gas refund, LM on new chains &amp; POL programs have been discussed for a long time"
67,"1/ The @paraswap budget proposal passed with 299 votes and 55.3% Accepted the potential max spending 🔥
