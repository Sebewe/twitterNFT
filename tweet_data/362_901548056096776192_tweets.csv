51,.@coinbase . The crypto economy isn’t just the US. Feel free to roll out tax tools and coinbase card to 🇬🇧 and EEA   While you’re at it; make USD trading pairs available here too.

77,"@medicrypt It’s pretty much that. It has a few use cases, for primary sales / minting/ issuing - we collect payment in fiat, convert to crypto. Collect wallet address, authorise seller to send nft to address. Settle with the seller in crypto or USDC &amp; handle payment &amp; kyc in the background"
78,"5/ If this is something that will be beneficial for your brand / business

Get in touch 👇

79,4/ Setup is quick and easy and we built it to be seamlessly integrated into your stack. We handle the payments and KYC so you can focus on web3 reach and adoption.
80,"3/ Let’s talk conversions rates. NFT Checkout converts 2.5x more users than standard crypto only checkouts and supports any blockchain. It also,  delivers NFTs directly to an on-chain wallet address. 

Your choice of blockchain isn't a blocker."
81,"2/ NFT Checkout also removes the need for customers to buy crypto to top up a wallet, just to buy an NFT. It reduces the purchase journey from 9 steps to 3. https://t.co/dImO1f7Iof"
