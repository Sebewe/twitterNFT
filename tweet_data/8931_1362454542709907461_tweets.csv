1,@FUCKINGRUG @DOJICREW @BUILTBYQUANTUM The Zingot Economy is heating up! Lots of action in the Zingot Marketplace and the community Zingot Exchange liquidity pool is growing. We have even attracted a bot arbitraging between the two liquidity pools. Don't sleep on this one...🔥🔥🔥 #ZingotEconomy @DOJICREW @JamesAme72 https://t.co/n6ldFY0dff

25,@JamesAme72 @FrozenEwok @DOJICREW @FUCKINGRUG Yes! Doji vs Xcrew = good vs evil = James vs Rug?      (Btw I have no idea how to create a DDoS attack... so far ; )
26,@FrozenEwok @DOJICREW @JamesAme72 @FUCKINGRUG Haha. That's an interesting idea I hadn't thought of before... Thanks for the suggestion 😉
27,Big fan here of the pen/ink/digital art by @JamesAme72. He's a legendary street artist and it's almost seamless to buy his work in the Zingot Marketplace. Almost don't want to share the news and increase competition... These sell out in mere minutes even with stealth releases... https://t.co/QUXCgQsx6C
28,"@Thorium_Photo @DigitalxMisfits Right side, at least for digital viewing. The increased contrast/shadow distribution is more eye grabbing"

70,A forest can regrow after a fire but it takes a lot of time and energy. It's a lot easier to MAINTAIN your web3 reputation than to REBUILD it after a dumpster fire. Put out fires early and own your mistakes. How we do it really matters. The Blockchain doesn't lie. BUILD.
71,No one is perfect and we all make mistakes. The reality of a digital world is that those mistakes are often on public display. How we handle them says a lot about who we are and the record of HOW we handle mistakes can strengthen or weaken our permanent web3 reputation.
72,My friend's genesis NFT series released today! She's already famous (in a semi-covert way) and you've probably seen her face before without knowing it. Support New Artists! https://t.co/BIMOcY9AEB

84,@trubbelmakaren @LooksRareNFT @RUG_TECH @FUCKINGRUG Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery they say... It does bring up an issue for web3 about IP protection and enforcement. IP gets stolen or copied all the time especially when there's no disincentive. Can we rely on self enforcement? Web3 is designed to be censor-resistant
