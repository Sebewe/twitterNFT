16,"7/ My Ultimate Prediction: Sports + Music

Several NFT projects involving sports teams, players and musicians will be hugely successful in 2022, setting up controversy between the leagues, labels, studios, and platforms over IP and revenue sharing."
17,"6/ Album NFT Definition: 

An NFT of NFTs (one for each song in order) which includes show notes, making-of content, community benefits, and generative cover art! This means musicians could sell many copies of the same song, but each would come with its own unique work of art."
18,"5/ Music Web3 2022 Prediction - Album NFTs

Spotify requires 10m-100m+ streams for musicians to earn a good living – a fraction of overall revenue after labels, studios, and the platform take their cut. Mainstream consumers increasingly know this and don’t like it."
19,"4/ Team NFT Definition (Part 2): 

3. ‘Fantasy sports-light’ rewards plus fan behavior rewards for check-ins at virtual events, game attendances, retail purchases, etc. 
4. Token-enhanced fan forums, watch parties, and team appearances plus exclusive merchandise and events."
20,"3/ Team NFT Definition (Part 1):

1. Player- and coach-driven (needs buy-in, but worth it).
2. Generative ‘pfp avatars’ of the players and coaches with a strong team-based narrative (origin story, glory days, local flavor, mascots, fight songs, traditions)."
21,"2/ Sports Web3 2022 Prediction - Team NFTs

“Fan loyalty is strongest with the team first, players second, and league third.” – AJ Banon, @serotonin_hq  VP Growth 

Web3 presents teams and players with too many opportunities to engage, monetize fans using IP beyond league rights."
22,"1/ My Belated Predictions for 2022 (Part I)

I see enormous potential for web3 commerce in sports and music. I predict 2022 to be the year of “Team NFTs” and “Albums NFTs”.
