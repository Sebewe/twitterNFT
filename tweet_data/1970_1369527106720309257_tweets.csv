54,"@ellistheginge @cerealclubnft @AzukiZen @nuclearnerds @nftchance @ellistheginge - I minted my 18 @nuclearnerds from the contract and still have 8! — also, this article is bullshit and unwarranted fud. Most of what @NFTethics said has already proven wrong. All they did was hurt the project. Not ethical to make claims without facts imo."

57,@coinlust @coolcatsnft Claiming it was an insider job? Making it sound like the cool cats team did it intentionally.
58,"@coinlust @coolcatsnft Haha dude, 80 eth ain’t shit for a lot of people in this space. I don’t mean to downplay how much 80 eth is… but for a very calculated play, this was a VERY safe play for someone to throw 80 eth into a token. So please try not to spread rumors you can’t back up."
59,@coinlust @coolcatsnft Someone was probably just scanning poly scan looking for any token that was called $MILK and 200 eth. Pretty easy to find actually.

63,@NFTethics You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. You’re creating rumors based on partial information and a gut feeling. Cereal Club is a real project with a real team. All you’re doing is hurting the space you’re claiming to protect.
