22,@0xMadEye My latest quote tweet ! 🙏
23,@BlKstut @0xfoobar Nice ! Yeh you seem like you are on top of things already haha 👌 Most importantly is that contract you interact with. Be safe out there 🙏
24,"@ArtalystNFT @0xfoobar Always trying my best, kudos to foobar for the great breakdown ❤️"
25,"@BlKstut @0xfoobar No tools to do that very easily, since signatures are also hashes of data. What i would do, is ALWAYS check the website im signing on three times, double the check the link, the authenticity, and the contract address you are interacting with (it shows when signing)"
26,@DeonteDen @flipdrago My last quote tweet ! 🙏
27,"Wow, great breakdown by @0xfoobar. Simply put, the point being made here is that one maliciously purposed signature you sign can rug ALL your NFTs, not one NFT, using a very technical delegate pattern. So please, PLEASE CHECK ANY SIGNATURES YOU SIGN ! https://t.co/4v6o4eDsfV"
28,@flipdrago Thanks Flip ! This is a great breakdown 🙏

30,"Seeing these exploits happen is just ugly. Will look into it today and put out my take on the matter. I lean towards phishing signatures rather than a fully exploited contract on the OS side. (haven’t looked at anything yet though, so nothing im confirming on end.)"
