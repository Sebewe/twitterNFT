80,"@ntkris Good Q - I should do a follow up thread to highlight this :)

It really depends on the nature of the project. I'd look up tokenomics models of projects that have successfully launched tokens like Audius, Filecoin, Graph etc."
81,"@Dktaspirations @osamakhn SAFTs are agreements for future tokens. The startup is committing to tokens when they issue a SAFT.

Warrants give the startup optionality to issue tokens at the right time."
82,"16/ If you are starting a new co and building something web3, this maybe something you want to keep in mind. HMU if you want to chat more!

PS: Not a lawyer
PPS: 🙏🙏 @osamakhn for helping me with this!"
83,"15/ This post by @jesewldn is required reading for anyone looking to take the leap into building in web3:

https://t.co/iK7LuZlw6Q"
84,"14/ At the very earliest stages, the skinnier the token warrant the better - it’s really hard to nail down your tokenomics when your company is just getting formed. You may have a baseline idea, but you don’t want to commit to a tokenomics model till you have achieved PMF."
85,"13/ These warrants are not SEC registered and they do not provide any guarantees for future tokens. They are an optional “side letter” that give both parties the optionality: for teams to issue tokens down the road, and for early backers to be rewarded for their contributions."
86,12/ Token warrants are a mechanism for equity holders to exercise the warrant to get tokens. The number of tokens that will be issued is commensurate with the investment (or proposed equity stake) in the company.
87,"11/ So how does an employee, advisor or investor (who traditionally only invests in equity deals or SAFEs) get tokens from a protocol or dapp that issues tokens? How does equity translate to tokens?

Alongside the equity or SAFEs, now Token Warrants are issued."
88,"10/ (There is more nuance here around accredited vs non-accredited investors)

But SAFTs have now mostly fallen out of favor in the US."
89,"9/ On the other hand, there have been at least 2 fairly well known cases to-date that have put the SAFT to test (namely SEC v Telegram and SEC v Kik). The finding was that this “promise for tokens” was used to build networks, and therefore were deemed securities."
90,"8/ @roneilr talks about it in this podcast:  https://t.co/siQrBNvC7D

There are of course many such  examples of a product starting off centralized, then going decentralized over time."
91,"7/ When there is clear and sufficient delineation between the core team and the community. What does that look like? 

The most elegant explanation I’ve seen of a product going from centralized to decentralized with the right token structure is @AudiusProject. https://t.co/sx7gQRZkWQ"
92,"6/ And this comes to the very crux of what could be a considered a security under the Howey Test. 

https://t.co/L53QF5HhhI

So what prevents a company’s token from being considered a security from the SEC’s lens?"
93,"5/ But if a company that is largely centralized and has a limited community launches tokens right out of the gate, those tokens could be considered an incentive for someone to participate and support the product."
94,"4/ To take a step back, companies introduce tokens so that their community feels true ownership over the product, service or protocol."
95,"3/ SAFTs (Secure Agreement for Future Tokens) have gained popularity in the last few years. SAFTs state that investors are investing in exchange for tokens in the future. And as an early backer, the investor will get a discount on the token price."
96,"2/ First we had convertible debt, then YC introduced SAFEs (Secure Agreement for Future Equity). These have been the most popular form of instruments to raise capital at the very earliest stages of a startup (equity based investments also being popular)."
97,1/ Token Warrants have become quite popular as founders in Web3 have been raising capital. But what is this mysterious document and what purpose does it serve?
