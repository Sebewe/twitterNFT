13,@stevefink Which high conviction bets ser?
14,@Coreggon1 @TastyBonesNFT @721starter Not guaranteed yet but someone posted API results in discord
15,@9x9x9eth @MadamSavvy That makes sense… but won’t they think the founders will have good influence rather than bad? ETH feels like the natural currency for metaverse and will have a stronger demand than digital gold?
16,"@9x9x9eth @MadamSavvy """"""But if 100% of humans adopt crypto, ETH will never flip BTC."""""" 

what do you mean?"

20,What are alternative NFT gallery options to @oncyber_xyz ?
21,"14) That's all! Thanks for reading. Good luck and have fun in the metaverse. 

If you enjoyed reading this, feel free to checkout my substack https://t.co/drHE9fZhKw"
22,"13) For example, @doodles is doing something new as the space doodles is non-dilutive. To me, that is innovation.

https://t.co/uEX67zuIsr"
23,12) The current NFT space has tons of imitators and idiots. And I believe the biggest key to win is to tell the innovators from immitators and idiots.
24,"11) 
""""""First come the innovators, who see opportunities that others don’t. 

Then come the imitators, who copy what the innovators have done. 

And then come the idiots, whose avarice undoes the very innovations they are trying to use to get rich.""""""

-- Warren Buffet"
25,"10) ### Last Thought - Innvators, Immtators, Idiots
At the end of the day, what matters most is innovation. And what retains value is constantly delivered innovation."
26,"9) ### Roadmap
You should probably also check out the roadmap for the project in the next few months, and ask yourself, does it excite you? You can typically find this info in discord channels or ask there."
27,"8) ### Aesthetics
Coming from tech background, I am not an art expert. I just buy innovative NFTs as long as they do not look ugly."
28,"7) ### Community
- Some questions to ask the discord group:
Why do you like the project?
What is the most exciting thing on the roadmap upcoming?"
29,"6) ### Community
Before I bought into @doodles, I asked at a few different times why people love this project. Typically if the discord does not give you good responses, that is a bad sign."
30,"6) ### Community
- Have you been in the project’s discord?

The best way to feel a project’s community is get into their discord and feel it out. Talk to them, ask why they like the project, feel the vibes."
31,"5) ### Team
- Do the team execute and deliver constantly?

Many people come into the space, issue an NFT and no longer work on it. This is often the case for NFTs issued by pop stars.

For NFTs to rise in price, there should be consistent value add from the team."
32,"4) ### Team
- What are the strengths of the team?

There are different flavors of the founding team. It could be art, marketing, or tech and product building.

Typically I prefer a tech and product led NFT project since there is typically more innovation."
33,"3) ### Team
- Are the team doxxed?

Doxxed means the team are not anonymous. Anonymous people can just rug you and be gone. Doxxed people will want to keep their reputation."
34,"2) ### Team
Team in my opinion are the most important criteria in evaluating an NFT project.

- Do you know who the team are?

A lot of times people will buy just by blindly following influencers. They do not even know who the people are behind the projects."
35,"1) My friends often ask me - how do I evaluate an NFT project? 

I summarized my thoughts into a thread 🧵👇"
