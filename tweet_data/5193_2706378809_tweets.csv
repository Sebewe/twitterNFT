20,"@mfer5451 @RugRadio @SyndicateDAO 2/ I trust the authorizations I grant to collabland and syndicate to claim tokens, and will double check that when I sign those transactions - that I am mindful to verify that I am granting the intended permissions."
21,"@mfer5451 @RugRadio @SyndicateDAO 1/ In this example - I would have 1 wallet on my ledger marked as ""Rug Radio"" which would hold my Genesis NFT, Rug Tokens, and any other tokens I want to use in that ecosystem. I would then use that wallet to sign collabland and collect tokens - exclusively. No other auths."
22,"@mfer5451 2/2 Further, as we've seen with the opensea phishing attack that took place this week, it highlights how vigilant we have to be when signing transactions - while being mindful of any authorities we are granting. Great question!"
23,"@mfer5451 1/. Love this question - highlights the importance of avoiding a monolith model with a hardware wallet - 1 hardware device can generate an infinite number of wallets, my recommendation is to separate assets across multiple wallets, and only use one for contract interaction."
