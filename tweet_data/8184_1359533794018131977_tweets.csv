8,@Legend Good point
9,"RT @Legend: It has been minted 

You selling it or coming to VeeCon?! @ForSureNotHere https://t.co/KbqAmN07vX"
10,@Legend Gooood morning
11,"@nicksdjohnson Because it’s based on *your* conflict of interest, while other people may have already made up their mind and decided what they want (Yes/No), so I think you should’ve waited to see what they want before voting on their behalf, but you rushed and voted according to your opinion."
12,"@nicksdjohnson p.s. your Snapshot has %100 “For” at the moment, which shows the opposite of “voting on behalf of other people”, if the people who have delegated to you have a different opinion than you, then I can’t see how you’re voting on their behalf."
13,"@nicksdjohnson I know how delegate system works, my point is that you know from the beginning that you can’t be abstain and especially in this case, so why you rushed to vote?"
14,"@jinkeez1 @nicksdjohnson Jokes on you, understand what I wrote then come back, he already voted “abstain” on EP6.1, he shouldn’t have done that before doing personal Snapshot and voting on it."
15,"@0xTycoon @nicksdjohnson He already rushed into submitting an actual vote which is “abstain”, he should’ve waited for the vote results on his personal Snapshot."
16,"@sassal0x Keep the jokes aside please, this is a serious matter."
17,"@nicksdjohnson So because you PERSONALLY have a conflict of interest, you voted on behalf of everyone who has delegated to you, tell me that’s a joke please.. Web3 at its finest."
18,@nicksdjohnson Bring back @BrantlyMillegan for god sake
19,"@hypemansionclub @Legend Wish I could go to Veecon, I’d love to do so but I’m unable.
I’d rather keep it than sell it for 1 eth, if you value networking and value the art and the rarity of this piece then you know it worth more than that."
