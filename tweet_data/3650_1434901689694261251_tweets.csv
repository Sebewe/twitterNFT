63,@DaveVescio And I say this as someone who makes 6 figures per year.  The current average wage is borderline slavery.
64,"@DaveVescio Since Covid restrictions began, we have reached all time high prices and unemployment, while the top 1% have seen record growth in wealth, and they still see a ""need"" to increase prices. This just further increases the wealth gap. It's disgusting."
65,"@DaveVescio People deserve a living wage, regardless of the position. Far too long the top 1% have lined their pockets with tens of millions of dollars, while the bottom 50% have to make the choice of whether to eat or pay rent.
Inflation only hurts the average man."
