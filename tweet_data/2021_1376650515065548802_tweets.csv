4,"Retweeting for better visibility for everyone who was asleep when I posted this last night.

The NFT Billboard Token is up for auction for 3 days (2.5 now), starting at 0.1 ETH. All proceeds will go to @reli3fxyz to help with humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. https://t.co/xHjiyGwxW1"
5,@MargaretLabour I'm sorry lorepunk. Thinking of you and your family ♥️
6,"@iamDCinvestor @reli3fxyz They are working directly with organizations in Ukraine, so it's not like contributing to the Red Cross where you're money might be spent elsewhere around the globe."
7,"@iamDCinvestor I've been impressed with @reli3fxyz's due diligence
https://t.co/OdD3j86DIc"
8,"@Zeneca_33 While tacky to jump into a thread and shill another project, but I literally just started an auction where 100% of the proceeds with go to Ukraine, and the art is... comparable to Kevin?
https://t.co/xHjiyGwxW1"
9,@reli3fxyz @andrwwang Thank you to everyone who has donated their time and/or money thus far to assist the people of Ukraine. There are some people in this space with tremendous hearts. The internet of value has unlocked the ability for us to do incredible things together.
10,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang I still wanted to contribute in a meaningful way. Could I eek out enough time to build something small?

Then I remembered I had the NFT Billboard in my back pocket! I found the time to reword some text on the webpage, and now the auction can begin."
11,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang When Russia invaded Ukraine I knew that Web3 could be used to help the people of Ukraine in a big way, but I did not have the bandwidth to build anything...

I breathed a sigh of relief (reli3f) when I saw Andrew's tweet and the quick response."
12,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang So I would need to look for a new charity. But I had ideas for other things to build that I'd focus on first...

Then things with my day job got busy, and things in my personal life even more so. Several weeks went buy where I didn't get my IDE open."
13,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang There was nothing educational about the NFT Billboard, so it would have to fill its purpose via charity, and why not start out with a bang and donate 100%?

I had a charity in mind. I reached out. They said thanks but no thanks. They were anti-NFT."
14,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang Sylph Dapps was born, and the NFT Billboard was brought under its umbrella.

https://t.co/oFzikCX1UR"
15,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang I would do my part to counteract these turns offs by having everything I created going forward either teach about web3 or have part of its proceeds go to charity (or both).

I would show people that the learning curve wasn't that bad and that real good can be done with crypto."
16,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang Later in the year I decided that what I wanted to do going forward was help folks get into web3, but there were two common turn-offs that needed addressing:

- The learning curve
- The prevalence of scammers, thieves, and otherwise bad actors"
17,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang Alas, my following at launch was zero, and my skills are not in marketing. The few people I awkwardly reached out to about it didn't respond to me. Knowing more now, I went about it all wrong."
18,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang When I launched it last April, I had hoped it would become something everyone in the NFT space would talk about.

Who would be the buyer? A DAO? A private company with .eth in their handle?

What would they post?

Would they ever sell?"
19,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang On the NFT Billboard Token: It is an NFT that gives the owner the ability to edit the message on the billboard on https://t.co/ACZ5JdqKn8.

Messages on the billboard are stored on-chain, forming a permanent history of all the owners and their messages to the world."
20,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang No matter how much money this auction raises, I feel comfortable knowing that Reli3f will responsibly deploy it where it can make the biggest impact for the people of Ukraine."
21,"@reli3fxyz @andrwwang The Reli3f team quickly rallied a big group of A-list artists and raised $1m for Ukraine. Awesome!

But what made me choose them as my recipient was how much due diligence they're doing when deciding where the money goes.

I know it's tacky to ask, but if you can see this, consider being liberal with the retweet button."
24,"Two months ago I pledged to auction off the NFT Billboard Token for charity.

I can think of no better time than now and no better recipient than @reli3fxyz.

The auction starts now and will run for 72 hours.

30,"@punk6529 It is. And it is actually kind of annoying for projects where the purpose is NOT art but the utility.

The exception to this is Uniswap v3 LP tokens, but those get a pass because their community is not there for art. The LP tokens just happen to be NFTs."

34,"If your aren't one of these 35k, consider giving @0xQuit a follow. Anytime a new project drops or a hack happens, he's all over the smart contract figuring out if you are safe. Very knowledgeable about the stand mixer market, too. https://t.co/qyTYiEPug5"
35,"@runasand @JacopoMalensek Yes, the Russian govt would have trouble getting data from exchanges that don't operate under their purview, but that shifts the claim that donations are hard to track from a property inherent to crypto to a property of the policies of each exchange."
36,"@runasand @JacopoMalensek Honestly the hardest part will be getting the addresses from the Russian exchanges because it involves coordinating with other humans, but if you want to track people who donated directly from a bank account you have to do that step, too."
37,@runasand @JacopoMalensek Export the addresses to CSV and cross-ref that with addresses from Russian exchanges and you've got names. A little harder if people have withdrawn their crypto to a separate address but they can be linked up again with an npm lib.
38,"@runasand @JacopoMalensek I'm not trying to be rude, but you might want to consider deleting your first tweet. People are less likely to see your follow ups, and the misinfo (albeit unintended) could end up really hurting some people."
39,"@runasand @JacopoMalensek Yes it is less controllable, but it is easy to track with no special resources to set up.

You can go to the donation address on Etherscan and see all the addresses that donated."
40,@tmagled @andrwwang Can you explain what you *did* do that led to you thinking you'd done something wrong? Seems there is room for a UX improvement.

42,@andrwwang I have a 1/1 for you. I sent you a DM about it at the beginning of all this. hmu when you are ready and if you are interested. I'm prepared to auction it myself and donate the proceeds but would prefer to do it through @reli3fxyz directly.
43,"@tayvano_ @100Thieves New development! Maybe a country under attack can do it without blowback (assuming their Twitter account isn't hacked of course):

44,"@reli3fxyz Where will the funds be withdrawn to? A multisig?

What is the best addr for those of us who want to kick in our own funds to do so? Presumably wherever these funds will be withdraw to rather than this address itself."
45,"@NFTHYPEMAN @andrwwang @reli3fxyz I know how you feel. I sent him something early on in this whole thing along the same line as you, but he hasn't had the time. Maybe tomorrow after he's had some rest."
46,"@andrwwang The contract owner, which is a single external address, can withdraw to any address. Please have him withdraw to a multisig. Not saying I don't trust the dev, but a single compromised/lost key could ruin this whole thing."
47,"32 hrs after @andrwwang's ""how can we help?"" tweet, @reli3fxyz opened minting and raised over a $1m in 30 secs, all of which will help the people of Ukraine.

This is what the internet of value makes possible. This time scale is impossible in web2.

What we do know is that the contract the thief used to collect sigs was deploy 30 days ago.

It's interesting OpenSea says it wasn't email phishing. That was the prevailing theory last night"
79,"@iKOR_OG @opensea Nope. The thief collected signatures from users over the last 30 days and most likely exercised them last night because they were running out of time since the OS contract migration would have made them useless.

X2Y2's airdrop timing was an unlucky coincidence it would seem."

90,@JacobOracle @DirectorJayC More info is coming to light and the phishing email explanation is holding water.
91,"@econoar The site the hacker would have set up would have had the user connect their wallet in order to sign, in which case they'd have their address, too."
92,@andrwwang Correct. The timing is just coincidence. Purely OpenSea + phishing
93,"Revoking approvals also works, but the usual revoke sites are down. @0xQuit is putting together instructions on how to do this from the contract UI."
94,"Distilling info from various people:

- Hacker likely sent a phishing email to collect sigs from OpenSea users over the course of a month
- Hacker waited until now to act because the contract migration would render the sigs useless
- Moving NFTs to new wallet protects you"
95,@econoar This all tracks. And Saturday night of ETH Denver was the last best chance to strike.
96,@andrwwang That tracks actually. The hacker could have been collecting approvals for days/weeks and waiting for the best time to strike to maximize their take. OpenSea migration forced them to act or miss out entirely. Saturday night of ETH Denver would be the last best chance.
