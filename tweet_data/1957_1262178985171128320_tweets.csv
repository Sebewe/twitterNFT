79,@999_voodoo The entire thread really just boils down to these four words
80,"None of this is a suggestion to buy/sell $LOOKS, although I do have some staked soooo nfa 

Research has come mainly from the internet and ser @cobie newsletter"
81,"Hopefully the dev team @LooksRareNFT continues to build and grow the platform into a truly community-owned NFT platform, where fees are distributed among users instead of OpenSea’s war chest

For now, it’s in its infancy"
82,"13/ The good news is that the share of fees distributed to the community will only increase over time as token creation continues to dilute seed stage backers

The value of $LOOKS will continue to play a big role"
83,"12/ The important takeaway from all of this is that @LooksRareNFT remains a legitimate product

It’s not a rug pull, and the price drop has been the result of misunderstood tokenomics and inflated expectations

There is still a future here"
84,"11/ The team cashing out nearly $73,000,000 in $WETH the other day came from the staking rewards on their locked tokens from Day 1

In my opinion, this is not a bad thing as the team can use these to invest in long term growth for the DEX

And maybe a nice car along the way too"
85,"10/ The factors put together contribute to the price of $LOOKS spiraling downward from a high of $7 to now $1.70 range

With the reduction in wash trading, this is likely a more fair evaluation of @LooksRareNFT"
86,"9/ It now becomes likely that at some point users will pay more $ in fees than they receive in rewards

Thus wash traders will lose their incentive, stop, and the amount of $WETH paid in fees will decrease

These fees are used to pay “Staking Rewards” so APY also falls"
87,"8/ The incentive for wash traders to swap $LOOKS for $WETH has created significant selling pressure on $LOOKS on a daily basis

As price falls, so does the $ amount of volume rewards handed out per day"
88,"7/ These incentives have invited clever wash traders into the platform, that are aiming to pay less in fees than they receive in $LOOKS

They can then convert these tokens back to $WETH, compounding profits on a daily basis"
89,"6/ Now let’s focus on the concept of “Volume Rewards”

When users buy/sell on the platform, they pay fees in $WETH

Their trading activity is rewarded with $LOOKS hence the “volume rewards”

It acts as somewhat of a reimbursement"
90,"5/ From the above chart, we see that seed stage investors get diluted over time

Their tokens are locked, while the tokens in circulation increases steadily

So while many people believe the price is falling due to insiders dumping, this is most likely not the case"
91,"4/ Here’s the Token Release Schedule 

It seems complex but it’s actually simple.

The amount of $LOOKS in circulation increases over time, this just shows you where they come from

We see that the majority comes from trading volume rewards https://t.co/e6MjhdTg3M"
92,"3/ But the most important thing to note is that not all of these tokens are stakeable from day 1

For example, the Community’s “Staking Rewards” and “Trading Rewards” are tokens that will accrue over time but are not immediately present to stake"
93,"2/ So we see that right off the bat, the @LooksRareNFT team + seed investors make up around 13.3% of token ownership, but these tokens are locked for varying timeframes

At first glance, it gives the impression that LooksRare really is the DEX NFT marketplace we’ve needed"
94,"1/ First off, let’s take a look at the tokenomics structure which has been publicly available

The “Strategic Sale” makes up the private seed rounds where $LOOKS is sold for a discounted price per usual https://t.co/i40k9UUFqX"
95,So why has the price of $LOOKS fallen from an ATH of $7 to $1.70 in less than a month? 🧵
