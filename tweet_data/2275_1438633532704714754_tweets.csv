7,@followrobwhu @creatureNFT 🙌🏻
8,@muzzy00 @creatureNFT That wet one is so nice. It better sell today or I’ll lose all faith in humanity.

11,@hluduzit @AdamBombSquad Craziness. I hope that liquidity was worth it.... 😩
12,"Folks out here selling Error Terror @AdamBombSquad for 5 and 6eth a piece... my lord.

Mine is now the only one listed, at 50eth. And even that's too low."
13,my @doodles out here lookin like Ron Weasley after stealing his dad's flying car https://t.co/SWUz5cbn45
14,Okay... stay with me here... my Space Doodle might be so common it's actually... rare? https://t.co/dIiSTqEG0S
15,It's all fun and games until you reveal a common af space doodle.
16,Couldn't even include the 10 most recent sales in the screenshot. Smh. @3landersNFT https://t.co/ex2mg3Q7xA https://t.co/lp1ijUiREX
17,@mrmakerbot @3landersNFT Those of us who remember Doodles’ early action had an advantage on this one…
18,"Great entry point at 1.43 on @3landersNFT right now. 

I'll check back in a couple weeks to see how this aged."

29,@LurkingisToxic @dmcrypt_ @3landersNFT Big brain right there.
30,Pleased to see panic selling is still very much a thing even when all your money went to charity 😅
31,"I will never not buy @dannycoleee's art. And for a good cause to boot? No brainer.

44,@bigboyfraser @3landersNFT @3landboy Damn 🔥🔥🔥
45,@_OneBit_ @creatureNFT It’s honestly crazy. I can’t count on one hand how many days in the past decade a stranger has gone out of their way to compliment something I’m wearing. Three of those days have been when I’ve worn the thermal sweater.
46,@humpstyles @3landersNFT @creatureNFT Just layered in the pic of the sweater from https://t.co/oaPf8aYgK4 😂

50,"@500eth @dannycoleee He tweeted a genuine apology. “But we still got the pics”? This ain’t it either. He’s one of the most open hearted people in the space. Others deserve your pitchforks, not Danny."
51,@etherzach @coolcatsnft That’s a clean cat right there
52,@andrwwang @dannycoleee Damn no overall. Seems rare.
53,@itsmechase Smart money right there.
54,"1. Experienced folks will flip for a ton of $$$.
2. New folks will be left holding the bag, hoping to reveal a rare.
3. They will not.
4. The floor with CRASH.
5. Any sense of ""community"" will be lost to panic and anger as every holder loses $20k overnight.

I've seen this movie."
55,At least the Meka and Hape artists remembered to include faces... smh.
56,Anyone buying an Invisible Friend right now with the intention of holding through reveal needs to donate their brain to science.

60,"Some teams are in it for a cash grab, and then some pull a 1/1 and give it back to the community (when other 1/1s have already sold for upwards of 35eth). 

And I thought I liked this project before… https://t.co/1NgqSl69pz"
61,Whoops. https://t.co/D5VIFIe2i9
62,"Sold a floor @doodles and bought these two rare DNA @3landersNFT. Will probably buy more.

Bullish for many reasons... but mostly because (just like Doodles) the art is broadly appealing, yet completely unique in the space. And even the ""floor"" 3landers make a distinctive pfp. https://t.co/XwhtWBpSc9"
63,@AprilBrown_ @3landersNFT That’s a clean 3lander right there.
64,@BirloNFT @3landersNFT @3landboy @NFTStubby 🤝 https://t.co/y7eFG1VuPK
65,One of the realest in the space with one of the realest threads in the space. Sending my love to @tobylasso and anyone else trying to build authentically despite getting met with undue hate. https://t.co/oUZsGgVIMk
66,"Did a thing*

*a bigger thing than I usually do. https://t.co/8o3w3YzDCq"
67,A cash grab with cool art is still a cash grab. https://t.co/SYImgu1QEe
68,"@nonfungibledroo Yeah, it’s the exact same project with a different name (and without the months of team building/prep that went in WR). He 100% deserves compensation for his WR art. But to rip them off in return just kinda proves their point that he wouldn’t have made the art without them."
69,I get feeling burned. I get wanting (and deserving) your fair share as an artist. But if your solution is to blatantly rip off the ethos/creative vision of another project (and fellow artists) and leverage the NFT community’s goodwill for a get-rich-quick scheme… eeesh. https://t.co/ZgTqYjAkIo
70,"@nonfungibledroo How much of that 3mil will be lost to the years of litigation he’s signing himself up for, I wonder 🤔"
71,@rosen_ilan @creatureNFT Color (pencil) me impressed.
72,Is Oscar voting closed yet or nah https://t.co/k0ZvQ7FIyF
73,@dannycoleee Praise the pile!
74,@TheCryptoFool Sent myself .00001 because I’m cheap.
75,"@Alyssakd22 @creatureNFT One of the highest unique holder counts and lowest active listings of any 10k project. Extremely fun and welcoming discord community. An ever-evolving art project, led by the artist himself. Best clothing release of any NFT project yet, bar none."
76,"@KindLionNFT @kjmeichtry Yeah I think I spent about $120. Had to transfer some NFTs into my hot wallet and list them on OpenSea because I didn’t have enough eligible collections, after I had already spent gas approving ineligible collections 😭😭"
77,@KindLionNFT @kjmeichtry This is true. No chance of grease burns either.
78,"My current bags:

2 under my eyes"
79,"Nobody:

x2y2: yes, we are going to give you $1500 for free, but first you must answer 3 riddles, find your way through 5 hedge mazes, and solve today's Wordle on the first try."
80,@dannycoleee Just copped. My eyes will be ready in 1-2 business days. https://t.co/aoqpmvfgwi
81,@dijosong @WeatheReportNFT 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 all the work of @SSNSANTA
82,@NFT_NEWS_USA @WeatheReportNFT This is correct. And I’m sure they wish they had…
83,"@NFT_NEWS_USA @WeatheReportNFT Totally agree. I’m more confused about why they were taking 50%. The project would be much better served if they put that money back in to the project, and it didn’t go as profit to anyone."
84,"Yes, they are doing a terrible job with PR.

But I’m failing to see how a work-for-hire unknown artist being offered $150k off initial sale alone (assuming a .1 mint price) is anything but generous. 

If anything, the other @WeatheReportNFT founders should’ve taken only 5% too."
85,"I think this Creature wants me to jump out the window with him… and you know what, I would. https://t.co/aQBntBfeh7"
86,"I like how Cool Cats and Cool Pets are flying NOW, as if folks were waiting to see if the game was a rug 😂😂.

The @coolcatsnft team is and has been professional af. Better to delay and protect the community than rush a faulty product. 

But welcome to the new holders!"
87,@KidHastings @dmcrypt_ @creatureNFT mecha. creatures.
88,"Picked up a couple speshies. Admittedly, it's my third time buying into @CoolmanUniverse ... and I was dumb not to see its full potential before. 

Will be holding onto these lil guys for dear life. https://t.co/oH3CgfBmE1"
89,"There are 70,000 seats in SoFi stadium.

If the *very small and elite* group of people who bought Super Bowl tickets instead put that money toward NFTs, there would hardly be enough in your 7 favorite “blue chip” projects.

Supply shock is coming. We are early."
90,@rodolfus_ Had the exact same thought.

92,@AdamBombSquad Yeah but no free jacket since the snapshot already happened. Pity the buyer 🤷🏻‍♂️

95,@RR11058911 @timmayeur @AdamBombSquad Jealous you get a free jacket!
96,"@pls_dex @AdamBombSquad It certainly does! But it’s gonna take a far more ambitious offer to pry the green fedora from my cold, diamond hands."
97,@timmayeur @AdamBombSquad You are correct. We’re making progress!
98,Best offer I’ve received since September. Bullish for ⁦@AdamBombSquad⁩. https://t.co/PItwcfKHLd
99,"@PuffYatty No question, @AdamBombSquad. Lowest floor and most room to run for a project with a team I believe in 100%."
