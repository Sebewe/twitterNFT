13,"This is a war reporter based in Ukraine reporting LIVE on his Twitter feed, but as you can see, this video was a plea for help made a MONTH AGO. Very eye-opening... https://t.co/VlruS9LdJ8"
14,@cyantist Fascinating! Thanks for sharing!
15,"Not to mention...if we isolate the country like North Korea, what happens to the innocent people in the country? They will have a tough time...

They also will make more nukes."
16,"If we agitate them more, then what...nukes? 

If we keep the peace, then we (USA) let them keep growing in power?

Do we just keep adding countries to our NATO alliance and hope Russia isn't threatened by it?"
17,Do we punish Russia by placing sanctions that can really mess up their economy and agitate them even more? Or do we befriend them (knowing they don't have the same philosophy as us + a bad history) and try to keep the peace?
18,"Putin is a bad man with a whole lot of nukes that can blow up earth many times over and he's taking over and attacking a country filled with innocent people right in front of our eyes.

This is a very tricky and sad situation."

30,"@maxwellstrachan @nitashatiku KYC must be done on creators in the NFT space to avoid fraud &amp; copyright infringement. I really feel this is the only way.

It's the same thing as a company going IPO w/out anyone knowing a thing about them. This should be applied to the NFT space."

87,"This guy @dt_chain just bought a #CryptoPunk NFT for 8,000 Ethereum, which is $23.3 million dollars.🤯

I'm really curious as to why? https://t.co/EDgz64Kg4n"

90,"Artists, please don't repeat the same mistakes that artists have made again &amp; again throughout history. As they say OWN YOUR MUSIC. 

If you want to share $ w/ your fans, that's amazing, but you can't determine how that's done or how much if you don't own the rights! 😄"
91,"Lastly, FULL commercial rights in the hands of the wrong people (who are not educated in the music space) can really mess things up &amp; cause major headaches in terms of the administrative work that comes from registering/collecting from different revenue generating entities."
92,"Third, giving away FULL commercial rights does not build a healthy community around an artist. It's about control over the artist's work. I want my community to be partners, supporters, listeners, true fans - not my owners."
93,"Second, it's only right that artists get to determine how their music is used &amp; monetized, (or not). 

Giving up FULL commercial rights opens up the chance that anyone can legally use your music w/ imagery that goes against your morals and values...AND profit from it."
94,"First reason, because artists should be the OWNERS of their work/copyrights. Not NFT holders or anyone else. 

Giving away FULL commercial rights will re-create the issues around artists losing control and being slaves of the record labels. Please, not in Web 3."
95,"As an artist, I WILL incentivize my music NFT holders through participation of future royalties, partial commercial rights, and other great incentives in the future. However, I will choose to NEVER give away FULL commercial rights or copyrights to my musical works

🧵Here's why👇🏽"
96,@hanneshummel @ninaadkothawade @artoninternet @whitelistart goodness that's beautiful
97,@rameerez dude that was one of the best explanations of NFT's in general I've ever read. Thank you for writing this!
98,@rameerez and if the smart contract never allowed for changes...then game over? the art is forever detached/non-existent from the blockchain
99,"@rameerez thanks for the explanation! once a project is released into the wild and has been traded, bought/sold, can this mutable issue be fixed?"
