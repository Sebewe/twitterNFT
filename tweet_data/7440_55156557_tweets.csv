1,"I've interacted with so many people from around the world, in English, that I often completely forget about our borders

That's why it's been so shocking to see familiar PFPs post images of war from Ukraine

I officially started this project on Sept 18th

So take this and triple it for a quick visual 😱

The workload has been absolutely insane

And we're only now finally at the point where we can launch

Worth it 💪 https://t.co/ZDPZkyExcH"

30,@212anon I'm looking to hire a full time Community Manager for my NFT project &amp; just saved myself a couple of weeks of work (and I potentially just saved myself from a bad hiring decision! 🙌)

I'm 4 hours in &amp; I'm already ROI positive 🎉

Really digging it in here with all these other passionate builders

LFG! (Learn From Groups!)"
32,"I eventually got the courage to ask for help on something critical

And everything worked out smoother than I could have imagined 😮

I got over my pride real fast"
33,"Moving fast in the dark boils down to how well you learn from others

And it took me WAY too long to figure this out

I repeatedly struggled to learn new things on my own, only to spend 6 weeks...

...instead of letting an expert coach me through things in just 1 week"
34,"gm!

Five years ago, I started my startup journey

I was so in the dark

I've always prided myself on being an excellent generalist

I had to do everything myself

But progress was REALLY slow

My problem?"
35,"What a special day indeed!

I also never really found myself to be big into social media, but Web3 really sucked me in 🌪

Really hope that one day I hit 10k too

39,"@Cooopahtroopa Amen to that. I've spent 5 years as a founder and the #1 sign that someone else is a serious founder is they put in the reps and consistently show up

That's it. That's the secret. Wayyyyy easier said than done"
40,"This is why I'm building in Web3 and why I think most people should be thinking bullish, not bullshit"
41,"I want the above, and I'm not alone in my desire to do these things

It's these use cases and untold more that are coming"
42,"I want the friction of doing this to be so low that billions of people can do this as an afterthought

^^ THIS"
43,"I want to automatically dedicate 10% of my savings account's APY to fund people planting trees all over the world, day in and day out"
44,I want to zap 0.1% of my monthly wages around the planet to hundreds of people in need for near 0 fees
45,"This is why Web3 is not bullshit, at least not in the long run

Because in the long run:"
46,"Before Web3, fully automating the above and driving its friction to 0 (important) was inconceivable

Now that Web3 exists, the above is inevitable"
47,"But if you could do it on BTC then sure, Web3 don't care. Let the best dApp win"
48,"You can't do this easily right now on the BTC network, so this kind of development is being pursued on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, various rollups, etc..."
49,"I would very happily stake some amount of money to have the yield siphoned off automatically by this charity network

Hell, I'd even donate the principle"
50,The ethos of Web3 would say that perhaps we could codify this kind of social trust and build a decentralized routing network for charity
51,"There was no dApp that powered this transfer, and I could have just done this with Bitcoin

What struck me as incredible though was how Balaji was able to leverage his reputation to get many people to send coin to a naked Ethereum address"
52,"And just like that, doctors and nurses in India had more funds available to them to keep going and take care of people in a time of crisis

My sidelined capital got put to work, instantly"
53,"It took 5 minutes for funds to transfer from the moment I saw @balajis's tweet to the time the money settled halfway around the world

Collectively we raised millions of dollars (and then billions with Vitalik's donation 🤯)"
54,"This Web3 inspired human activity can be frivolous, but it can also be incredibly meaningful

e.g. this summer I sent $200 to the India Covid Relief Fund"
55,"Now think of the internet where you're limited not by geography but by gatekeepers

Web3 pushes this spectrum further by reducing the friction inherent in many human activities"
56,"Imagine a small factory town where there's 1 job. If the factory shuts down, human activity grinds to a halt

Now imagine NYC where you can work on anything and everything but you're still limited by geography"
57,"Think Web3 is bullshit?

You might be right, or you might just be incredibly shortsighted 🤷‍♂️

At first I was a total noob at:

• Managing a remote team of 10+
• Marketing on Twitter

Now I'm just a partial noob at these things 💀💀

I lost a co-founder. Sales ground to a halt

Every day I'd wake up &amp; my motivation was shot

Then I started my NFT project 3 months ago &amp; my team &amp; I have kicked ass each &amp; every day

I got my mojo back, baby, yeah!

91,"@lmorchard @CaseyNewton Yeah, it's pretty crazy how high the computational requirements have gotten. I've heard that many ETH mining rigs run in AWS. It's easier to just rent the hardware than to run it yourself, which hurts the ETH 1.0 case for decentralization a bit"
92,"@lmorchard @CaseyNewton As for ETH, you guessed it! I'm running a node to help speed up some software dev tasks

My ETH node isn't doing the computationally expensive work of mining transactions, so I also don't receive a reward there. The benefit to me and the network is similar to the BTC case though"
93,@lmorchard @CaseyNewton That's the benefit I personally get. The benefit the network gets is that there's a tiny amount of extra redundancy in the event that the network goes offline randomly.
94,@lmorchard @CaseyNewton Yeah great question. At least for Bitcoin I do it on principle just to have a copy of the blockchain for my own inspection. The cool kids call this self-sovereignty. It's nice because I don't have to trust Coinbase or anyone else to interpret the blockchain for me (&amp; perhaps lie)
95,"@lmorchard @CaseyNewton Sure! I've purchased mostly BTC with fiat just to hold it for the long term in cold storage. Any ETH I've purchased is also with fiat and typically used to interact with dApps. I run both an Ethereum node and a Bitcoin node because they're neat, but they are not mining rigs."
