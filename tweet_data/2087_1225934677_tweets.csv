Here is the full piece that I wrote about this - check it out🏆🏆

37,"ERC 1155 

The ERC 1155 is a token standard that contains both fungible and non-fungible assets. 

This is especially useful for NFTs that you want to have multiple editions for one piece of art."
38,"ERC 777 

The ERC 777 is a token standard that seeks to improve upon the ERC-20. It provides advancements in the way you’re able to interact with the token as well these other goals: https://t.co/J19fyFAbUl"
39,"ERC 721 

The ERC 721 is used for collectibles and it’s the standard interface for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 

The NFT can be an art piece or any other digital work. An example of the ERC 721 is the @BoredApeYC NFTs. The key element here is that it’s non-fungible"
40,"ERC 20

Probably the most important to understand is the ERC 20. It’s a standard interface for tokens that are fungible. 

Examples of ERC 20 are $Matic, $MANA, $ENJ, and more. These tokens can be used for a variety of purposes such as staking, voting, etc. https://t.co/3tb1ohmEvU"
41,"What are the different ERC Token standards? 

I’ll break it down for you here in this thread🥳

ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comments. From ERC 20, ERC 1155, to ERC 721 - all important to understand as you navigate the Web 3.0 space and NFTs✨
