Revolut, Badoo, TradingView, Miro, Telegram, Google, Ethereum, Kaspersky to name a few.

8,"@KatMB2017 @maxseddon @PentagonPresSec That’s a bold thing to claim that people of Russia are responsible for this. None even knew there would be an invasion, most didn’t believe that’s possible. 

Were all of US people responsible for dropping nukes on Japan, invading Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam? Don’t think so."

20,@lovennft @habbit_m Should a toe tattoos be a thing?
21,@lovennft @habbit_m The only bad thing about fingers tattoos is that there are not enough fingers 😩
22,"@habbit_m @lovennft I’ve been mulling the idea for a while, thought it would fall out, but with a good handpoke master I don’t even need a retouch (to our surprise). 

I love this side of teh finger cause it’s mostly hidden and a lot of people don’t notice it. 

Already have plans for more."

59,"@CarolinaMillan @gorkulus @GratefulApe_eth @opensea It is true though, this isn’t an easy thing. But there are ways to make it more fair. Maybe instead of community voted removal, tokens could be flagged. And of course voters should have a stake in the system, like owning governance token"
60,"@CarolinaMillan @gorkulus @GratefulApe_eth @opensea Well, more reason to partake. 

What would you prefer though. A single entity with absolute control to gang on anything it doesn’t like at it’s discretion or people doing it by vote in a democratic manner?"
61,"@u0iHuMTm2ZwnIx5 @ricematcha @AzukiZen Я сравниваю контракт с 751 и 1155, он всё таки сильно ближе к 751 с вырезанными частями и своим TokenOwnership. Даже по структуре контакта он слишком близок к 751 чтобы заморачиваться 1155 перелопачивать.

69,"@iamincommand Tetuan. Yeah, it was good as always 👌"
70,@Zeneca_33 I thought BAYC are baked
71,@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 Worse how?
72,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 DeFi decentralises finance and removes 3rd parties out of financial instruments. It isn’t made for some political reason to equalise wealth distribution so the questions are inadequate, not sure why do you ask that. 

As a side note, why do you need protection against forking?"
73,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 “Sell at a higher price to someone later”. As I mentioned, that’s how all markets work with more complexity on top."
74,@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 The whole tweet is a fallacy. Good job. Reaffirms that this is just a belief matter. Thanks for wasting my time thinking you’re here for some discussion but I think you already have your mind set. good luck 🤞
75,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 If you say that it’s the only novel solution you haven’t made enough research or just happened to be in the hater camp. It’s fine, people come around. If it’s truly worthless than surely all the brains will move elsewhere. 

Not all the solutions need centralisation. Look at DeFi"
76,@GratefulApe_eth @opensea It’s not like there is any benefits of web2 in there anyway. Just worst or web2 combined with toasted servers and one Jimmy on support.
77,"@GratefulApe_eth Sadly that’s the issue with centralised platforms like @opensea 

What we need is decentralised markets. DeFi but for NFTs, so we can move away from these behemoths that do web2 in web3"
78,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 As I also said, there is privacy on chain if you make it private. He is wrong on that front. Most people don’t care about it, some do, but it isn’t hard to have privacy even on publicly open chain just need to know how."
79,@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 People exploit people. The games themselves weren’t made for that. It’s a closed economy. True that it isn’t functional but many people still benefited from it making higher wages than they would otherwise working a normal job where they would otherwise be exploited by employers
80,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 The whole notion of asking to debunk 2h long video on twitter is tedious. He didn’t debate, he just made a video to make money on bashing crypto, which is popular to do. He is in it for cash and negativity sells. As an exercise, what’s a positive thing he said?"
81,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 3) P2E: he is right but he doesn’t acknowledge that we are witnessing a real life experiment with a theorised economy model, which is very fascinating regardless of your views

4) Chapter 13: you can say the same about any market. Replace word crypto and it will still work"
82,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 Since you ask in an awkward manner to debunk some of his stuff: 
1) “no privacy”: it is completely up to the user to have it whether you have no choice in web2
2) “NFTs / DAO only to buy crypto”: both are technology. It is up to the users/market what to do with it."
83,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 Just an example of what he misses (being average at best with his knowledge):
1) most user oriented apps run on APIs from 3rd parties instead of directly using the chain
2) most marketplaces are centralised (DeFi and dApps solve that)
3) you have to rely only on yourself"
84,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 Let’s not get frustrated. I’m also patient with misinterpretation of my words. Apologies if I write enigmas and it’s hard to read :)

Just going by your request, if he has made something with facts than refuting is kind of fruitless, don’t you think?"
85,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 Didn’t say that something is *based* on negative feelings. 

Just like news grab attention with negative stuff his video is focused on negatives, thus being one sided. 

Btw, since he has 0 expertise he misses some actual negative stuff that isn’t as superficial as scams ;)"
86,@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 I think you might have misread me.
87,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 Good strategy for views btw, not bashing the creator as he is it for the money / views and negativity attracts a lot more eyeballs"
88,@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 What do you mean which part? The whole video is framing crypto negatively from a one-sided view. It is catered to those who already hate on it and presents very average knowledge of the tech and shallow knowledge of the space as facts for a group of people who know even less. 🤷‍♂️
89,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 So again, unless you do it professionally (creating YT content), it’s not worth the time. Not everyone has all day free to bother with this and video production isn’t a quick and easy task."
90,"@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 As someone who already works 12h - 16h per day I just wouldn’t be bothered. Speaking for myself ofc.

Arguing with someone so one-sided is also a tough challenge as negative emotions are stronger than factual arguments, statistics, data based approach."
91,"@iamincommand Thanks man!

92,@ChrisMillerArt @0xMiller @Zeneca_33 Unless thats the thing you do professionally it’s too much of a time investment for practically a public service.
