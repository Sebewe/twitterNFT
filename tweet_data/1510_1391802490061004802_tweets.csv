I have friends who are stuck in Ukraine, can be interviewed, and want to get the word out: 

One is in the bombings in Kharkiv, 
One sheltered in the metro in Kyiv (musician),
One in hiding with many others near Khust (musician).

15,"My friend is still traversing Ukraine, and may or may not be able to leave at this point. 

The Ukrainians I have spoken with are devastated. I have never seen or felt anything like this. Terror. 

Please do what you can to support our Ukrainian brothers and sisters."
16,"I went to the Hungary-Ukraine border today.  

The border towns I saw are some of the poorest places I’ve been to in EU with no shelter/infrastructure to receive refugees (pic).

Many Ukrainians on foot, with no plan and 100km to traverse before any possible shelter.

Fuck Putin. https://t.co/Api0N8q3k0"
17,"If anyone has latest news about the Ukraine/Hungary border situation please let me know.

-Best places to cross the border
-If general mobilization rules are not fully in effect at any crossing
-Contacts on either side of the border actively helping or engaged
-Etc.

Please DM me"
18,"Quick update: I'm about to land in Budapest, meanwhile my friend is somewhere between Kyiv and HU.

He's likely to get to the HU border ~noon tm.

But he's afraid general mobilization gets announced, which would mean he couldn't leave UA. It's a race against the clock. Holy shit. https://t.co/aPyV1Jb5Tm"
19,"By the way, if you’re looking for a way to help Ukrainians today:

Buy Ukrainian art, support Ukrainian artists, listen to Ukrainian music, uplift the spirit of those creators.

Here is my favourite Ukrainian band, called Dislocados. Salsa in #Ukraine! 

https://t.co/uhJRVme5Xy"
20,"As a son of Polish immigrants who fled their country as political refugees, today has been hard. I have friends in Ukraine and have been several times. It is a magical place with a unique culture.

Ukraine is Europe, and Europe is my home.

27,@adaki2004 Thankyou!!
28,"Also: If you see any news about the Ukraine/Hungary border, especially with respect to Ukrainians fleeing, please let me know!"
29,"My friend was in Kyiv until 2h ago &amp; he's on his way to Hungary (less congested there than @ Polish border)

So I'm flying to Hungary, to get there ASAP &amp; pick him up (border crossings can be tough so my sponsorship might help). 

I can't believe it's come to this. Wish us luck!"
30,"If someone has a way out of Kyiv now please DM me, I have dear friends that are looking for a safe escape."
31,I have dear friends in Ukraine. I see people saying goodbye on Instagram stories because they don’t know what can happen next. This is terrifying.
