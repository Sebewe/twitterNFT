21,"@andrwwang @KaoSxEclipseYT 100% I just have reservations anytime we have to go off someone’s word alone. Most of these artists are trustworthy people, + I’m in agreement that the Ukrainian native artists should get the funds. Theoretical funds and funds in your wallet illicit different responses sometimes."

23,"@andrwwang I have to admit, the royalties going to the artists strikes me in a bad way. I love them all and they all deserve to profit from their art. But profiting off of this war seems in poor taste. Would rather have seen the secondary royalties go to Ukrainian charities directly."

Counter point: 

If you’re depressed, you aren’t alone. There are millions just like you. Your feelings are valid, but it is time to talk to someone. Counseling is readily available.

If you are thinking of harming yourself, call 800-273-8255 for immediate help."
49,@ZsMann I’m no sleuth so number 3 like the others is an observation. I do respect your perspective on a number of points. Your comment that #2 is not fact based is a little silly imo. The mint date for WR is public and suddenly their public and WL mints are before WR? That’s too ironic.
50,"Disclosure: I may mint the other project. I haven’t decided. I have also called out this project before. I have no ties to either, but (obviously) have known about the other project longer."
51,"@NFTethics seeing as you have been calling out red flags in new projects to help new people, and since you’ve commented on the other side of this, it may be appropriate for you to comment on this as well. I’ll support you all either way, consider this an invitation."
52,"3/🧵 To sum up: 

This project is extremely rushed. I have nothing against anyone minting (that has the money) in support of the artist. However, in any other circumstance I wouldn’t overlook these, frankly huge red flags. Only invest what you can lose. This feud is a nasty one."
53,"2/🧵

3. In 4 days, they had to have drawn hundreds of elements to use for art generation. This isn’t likely considering the project came to be in support of one artist.

4. The team came together around the artist to support him (good) in front running another project (bad)."
54,"1/🧵 For all of the new people out there that are thinking of minting this:

1. This project is 4 days old. You can tell it is young by the “joined Twitter date”

2. The reason it is being rushed is to get ahead of the @WeatheReportNFT mint. A project that they’re beefing with. https://t.co/bw1Ndi5RJV"
