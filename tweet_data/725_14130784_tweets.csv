3,I’ve been thinking about a fun way to explain crypto jargon to newcomers. All the acronyms/phrases can feel super intimidating at first. Hope this video is a fun 2-min crypto lingo 101 lesson that speaks to the spirit of women in Web3. (Music = Twisted Sister 3.0)

55,Our groupHUG cohort #0001 is crushing it! The below thread celebrates some of the big wins our cohort had this week and what’s coming for groupHUG in the week ahead! @WomenriseNFT @WomenandWeapons @BossBeautiesNFT @CuriousAddys @thehugxyz https://t.co/OnrxyYhBeL

60,"None of this is an excuse for nastiness on my part. I pride myself on being a cheerleader for women. I know we will come back stronger from this (earning back trust takes time) &amp; when ppl think of women-led projects, they’ll think of authenticity, integrity &amp; amazing original art"
61,"I do feel disappointed in ppl who bought/sold the project today. As soon as it was even a question that it might be stolen IP, seeking returns, buying in low, giving royalties to the project, doesn’t feel right. I hope ALL $ made since the info came to light goes to 1:1 artists."
62,I think the team showed strong leadership in their recent decision to remove the artist. I truly hope that the team did NOT know what was happening this whole time and my heart goes out to the community that bought into the project (I did too!) For many it was their first NFT.
63,"I deleted a recent tweet b/c it was mean. I don’t want to be a woman that kicks other women when down. I’m sorry. 

But so many are working tirelessly to show that investing in women-led projects is smart, so it’s a huge gut punch when that feels undermined by our own community."
64,"A toast to everyone building projects with authenticity and integrity. There are no shortcuts when building real value.

✨Build your project on solid foundation
✨treat people fairly
✨ issue real apology when wrong. own. up. 

A few bad actors do NOT define the entire category."

@sveedub (CEO of Hello Sunshine) on her excitement for web3 - I’m so excited about all the questions that have yet to be answered.  We are moving beyond a centralized media world."
76,"11/ SIRIUSXM 🎙🔥Mapping The Metaverse🔥 

@sveedub (CEO of Hello Sunshine) on the intersection of Web3 &amp; Media- It’s not enough to make content anymore, you have to show up and directly interact with your audiences."
77,"10/ SIRIUSXM 🎙🔥Mapping The Metaverse🔥 

@0xElan on the excitement of web3- I think most of the applications that are going to be mainstream haven’t been invented yet - there is so much potential for growth! I’m excited most about the new use cases."
78,"9/ SIRIUSXM 🎙🔥Mapping The Metaverse🔥 

@0xElan on how web3 will affect our lives - you can maintain one identity instead of having hundreds of them across multiple applications."
79,"8/ SIRIUSXM 🎙🔥Mapping The Metaverse🔥 

@0xElan on the definition of web3 - A new era of the internet - applications are all able to use a public shared database- that database is called the blockchain."
80,"7/ SIRIUSXM 🎙🔥Mapping The Metaverse🔥 

@0xElan on what sparked her interest in the blockchain space- I dove deep into crypto two years ago and my foundation came from a builders perspective, how it is a technology rather than an investment."
81,"6/ SIRIUSXM 🎙🔥Mapping The Metaverse🔥 

- @GaryVee on how we encourage more men to champion female projects - It’s all about action and putting the extra effort to lead by example.  Telling people to do something is a complete waste of time."
82,"5/ SIRIUSXM 🎙🔥Mapping The Metaverse🔥 

- @GaryVee on dream collaborators - I believe in business as a force for good, but most importantly, I want to work with kind people.  ""The Honey Empire"" - building an empire with honey not vinegar."

- @GaryVee on the future of NFTs - I believe every receipt for a luxury item in the future is going to be an NFT."
84,"3/ SIRIUSXM 🎙🔥Mapping The Metaverse🔥 

- @GaryVee on putting utility at the front of NFTs - We’re launching a smart contract (not just art or a collectible) - this creates value for in person events and so much more."
85,"2/ SIRIUSXM 🎙🔥Mapping The Metaverse🔥 

- @GaryVee on his first NFT “aha” moment-  January 2021 - This is the same way I felt when I saw Youtube and Facebook on the front lines.  I spent ten hours a day for a month learning NFT 101, and have not looked back!"
86,"1/ SIRIUSXM 🎙🔥Mapping The Metaverse🔥 

- @GaryVee on the emergence of web3- this is a fundamental consumer behavior shift.  Utility is the future."
