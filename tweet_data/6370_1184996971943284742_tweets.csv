13,@kerryflips Selling your space doodle IS selling your doodle. The NFT was just wrapped. There’s warnings when you convert it.
14,@kerryflips The doodles floor is 10 Eth so if you sold your space doodle for 3 ETH you took a 7 ETH loss if it was a floor doodle.
15,@kerryflips Lol hopefully this was a joke

35,"@PatriotNode @BarnOwlzNFT @NWO_NFT_ Had to Google that term. Inflated sense of self worth, sense of entitlement. Based on this interaction &amp; your previous posting, Sounds like you’re projecting. You’re good at it, accuse others of it first so it doesn’t sting when you get called out. Your defense mechanisms work."
36,"@PatriotNode @BarnOwlzNFT @NWO_NFT_ Actually as you can clearly see since you went to my stream, I don’t have a neckbeard.. I have an actual beard. But if ad hominem is how you get your rocks off, I truly hope you enjoy what you put out into the universe. As I said before, it’ll get better. I promise."
37,@PatriotNode @BarnOwlzNFT @NWO_NFT_ That’s what a leg day skipper would say. 🧐 🤔
38,@PatriotNode @BarnOwlzNFT @NWO_NFT_ Do you skip leg day? Is that the underlying issue here? I figured it was never about NFTs
39,"@PatriotNode @BarnOwlzNFT @NWO_NFT_ No ones mocking anything. Clearly you’re upset. You tried making fun of my intelligence instead of debating the topic Then tried to body shame, so clearly you’re tilted about something.Letting you know there are people to listen to your issues. My DMs are open if you need an ear."
40,@PatriotNode @BarnOwlzNFT @NWO_NFT_ Mories are here if ya need a hug. Discord’s open if you need to vent to let out any of that pent up rage or emotional trauma. It’ll be okay #famorie. 🫂
41,@PatriotNode @BarnOwlzNFT @NWO_NFT_ No ones emotional besides you. You’re upset and trying to draw conclusions but ya missed the mark. Majority of mories could care less as you’ve noticed across everyone’s timeline. Sorry you’re butthurt buddy. It’ll get better. I promise.
42,@PatriotNode @BarnOwlzNFT @NWO_NFT_ What poison? Mason &amp; iwwon are friends.  NFTs with objects as hats is commonplace. That’s literally the most basic alien ship shape that everyone draws. You have a bad take and it’s okay. I just pointed it out.
43,"@PatriotNode @BarnOwlzNFT @NWO_NFT_ Im not overexposed? Even at current prices I’m still multiple times up on my investment &amp; they’re my smallest bag. Nice try though, buddy. the trademark was filed 7 days ago on the skull x eyes &amp; mories have been out for half a year lol you didn’t look into this at all, did you?"
44,@PatriotNode @BarnOwlzNFT @NWO_NFT_ Right to ad hominem instead of debating the point. I think we both know who has the weaker position on this argument. Hope your day gets better buddy. Good luck out there.
45,"@PatriotNode @BarnOwlzNFT @NWO_NFT_ Uh, yes you can lol and this is the real world… so what’re you talking about haha"
