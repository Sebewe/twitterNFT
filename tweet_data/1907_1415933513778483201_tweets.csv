58,"From a purely speculative stance, there is no better play in the #NFT market right now than a #galamusic node. My OG founders Gaming node is priced at 100k and distributes about $100 a day 7 days/week. The Music node may be equally profitable."

81,@BitBenderBrink My take was that they were removing game because they had no control over their mechanics and fears securities fraud on their platform but would instead launch their own through valve. but no they just can't see the forest for the trees.
