1,@bmann @ChristopherA @chrismessina @kimdhamilton @Obstropolos @SpruceID @openid @bluesky @willnorris @selfissued @justin__richer @BlockchainComns I think it’s just a matter of time before native mobile wallets support their own version of snaps. @WalletConnect could evolve to support RPC extensions with little hassle.
2,"@ChristopherA @chrismessina @kimdhamilton @Obstropolos @SpruceID @openid @bluesky @willnorris @selfissued @justin__richer @BlockchainComns As you’ve already touched on in your research, we’re really optimistic about efforts like @gnosisSafe and @argentHQ who have production deployments with meaningful multisigs. And of course best practices need to make their way to those multisig shardbearers too."
3,"@ChristopherA @chrismessina @kimdhamilton @Obstropolos @SpruceID @openid @bluesky @willnorris @selfissued @justin__richer @BlockchainComns If I could press a button and have wallet infrastructure and the EVM use HD keys and ZKPs to demonstrate relationships to achieve new-key-per-tx, believe me I would. But ultimately the market plays an important role here and it’s dangerous to ignore it."
4,"@ChristopherA @chrismessina @kimdhamilton @Obstropolos @SpruceID @openid @bluesky @willnorris @selfissued @justin__richer @BlockchainComns Otherwise you would need to make a compelling GTM strategy for users to abandon their current wallets for one that supports your proposed system perfectly as imagined, or convince existing wallets to adopt your scheme entirely."
5,"@ChristopherA @chrismessina @kimdhamilton @Obstropolos @SpruceID @openid @bluesky @willnorris @selfissued @justin__richer @BlockchainComns As mentioned in my previous response, I believe MM snaps and related systems that allow for further derived HD keys are the best shot at implementing the system you describe at scale."
6,"@ChristopherA @chrismessina @kimdhamilton @Obstropolos @SpruceID @openid @bluesky @willnorris @selfissued @justin__richer Furthermore, the specification supports EIP-1271 which does enable multiple key usage, multi-sig, and rotation. Was this considered in your analysis?"
7,"@ChristopherA @chrismessina @kimdhamilton @Obstropolos @SpruceID @openid @bluesky @willnorris @selfissued @justin__richer We can only do so much with a single spec, and we won’t be able to solve multiple key use and rotation in one fell swoop, as convenient as that would be. There is a reason for multiple BIPS and I’m sure you know best of all that these things take time and combined effort."

11,"@chrismessina @Obstropolos @SpruceID @openid @bluesky @willnorris i’m really grateful that we might have another swing at this with web3, and i think we can agree it’s too important to mess up. really hoping to have your support in this along with other old-timers like @selfissued @justin__richer @ChristopherA @kimdhamilton and so many more"
12,"@chrismessina @Obstropolos @SpruceID @openid yes it’s really apparent that folks who were building oauth and oidc really wanted a more decentralized web and to put users first, artifacts like https://t.co/YrX25UvocD are a clear testament to this. it sucks to see how it ultimately evolved."
13,"@chrismessina @Obstropolos then you may be happy to learn that @SpruceID ❤️ @openid!! we are planning SIOPv2 compat for SIWE, welcome you to join our community calls to discuss further, thanks for your clarifications. we’re just trying to follow through on the impls too"
