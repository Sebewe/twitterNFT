82,@missmayad Awww I mean good products sell themselves!  Can't wait to see how the game unfolds!  Good luck with the rest of the mint!
83,@anslsmn @timepieces It's going to be fun the next 2 weeks!!!  Best of luck with your mints and decisions!
84,@timepieces Oh I can't wait to share what we get!  Best of luck for the rest of the mint.  The team is crushing it so far!
85,"14) Whether you pick up a Genesis piece, Mint/Burn your Slices of Time or pick up a piece on secondary it's worth a look at what @timepieces is building.  You may even get some IRL Benefits!

https://t.co/MiLAIXKlvS"
86,"13) Earn to Collectors: @timepieces has always been artist centric. Some of the artists are extremely popular and this could be a good entry point for their collection. 19 of these artists were introduced by other artists, so this may serve as a nice way to expand your collection"
87,12) Collect to Earners:  You basically get multiple shots at scoring a rare/desireable piece.  You can mint a desired year or red border for your Slices of Time or you can burn it for a chance at a desired artist/year.  Time is also partnered with @Coinbase_NFT for launch 👀. https://t.co/cDPGPhpdFH
88,"11) Why else am I excited for this mint?  I think @timepieces is the perfect collection for people that ""Collect to Earn"" AND those that ""Earn to Collect"".  We'll save a deep dive on these terms for later but Collect to Earn may have a shorter time horizon than Earn to Collect."
89,10) And then we come to Value.  Each Slices of Time mint will cost you 0.05 Eth which is only open to Genesis and Non Genesis Timepiece holders.  Details can be found below.  Most likely you're already aware and reserved or secondary will be your play at this point. https://t.co/oFYNuav1qd
90,9) For me. I saw the homie @DrifterShoots as one of the artists and already decided that was one I needed. I  met him at the Time POY event and wanted to reserve one of his pieces late last year.  A 2020 pre pandemic NYC skyline? Peep @jarvinart 2120 nature infused vision of NYC. https://t.co/Sxy6AIbeVv
91,"8) For my wife.  She immediately recognized the bridge in the 2102 piece by @RaulMunoz3D and whispered ""That's a bridge to Havana.""  Immediately she wanted to see @GGBIANCHINI 2002 piece.  Ironically...2002 was also the year she left Cuba for Miami.  So far one MUST HAVE. https://t.co/6v7GZnVwS3"
92,"7) My wife and I went through the collection and developed a game plan.  We couldn't CHOOSE which artists we would get, but we identified the artists we wanted.  The full collection of artists and their vision for the collection can be found here:

https://t.co/8Htw1ilNxC"
93,"6) Excerpt from their site:

""We then selected 19 artists, who in turn picked 19 collaborators, to create one piece of art each—one inspired by a year from TIME’s past and one by what they see as a hundred years in the future. So, for example, 1969 and 2069."""
94,"5) @timepieces has always been about artist collaborations but this collection is a classic.  Once you mint your Slices of Time you have a 10-day window to decide whether to keep that piece of BURN it for a chance at an ""Artist Slices of Time"" piece.  Decisions, Decisions..."
95,4) So if you're following you get to mint a collection from an iconic brand curated by their creative director who has designed over 750 covers spanning the last 20 years.  But here is where the game theory comes in.  You can now #burndw for a chance at 1 of 38 artist pieces!
96,"3) Each Year of Time's 99 year history will be represented in 99 original artworks made of the covers from that year.  Not all years are created equal, both from a historical and persoal perspective.  A breakdown of some highlighted years in link below 👇

https://t.co/4tRQ4Ua2Fr"
97,"2) Where it gets interesting is how the users will curate the rarity and distribution collection.  All users will mint a variation of the Slices of Time piece produced by @dwpine, Creator Director for @TIME.  Images below (Hint Red boarder is rare): https://t.co/OoRgbqeR3c"
98,"1) TL;DR on the overall drop details:  Timepiece Genesis Holders get to mint 2 ""Slices of Time"" pieces per genesis piece, and WOTY and Inspiration Holders (along with REKT Kitty) get to mint 1 piece from the collection.  Non Genesis Holders had to ""Reserve"" their pieces earlier."
99,"0) I am going to disclose this now before I get too deep into this thread (yes thread).  I am a HUGE supporter of what @timepieces is building and have been a genesis holder since mint.

Let's talk about ""Slices of Time"", a boutique minting experience on https://t.co/JXXqsfypgI"
