43,@MRMILLI0NAIRE @CountofZurich @Pul3eNFT
44,@GeoffStengel @Nashrimpy @LooksRareNFT Lol no I don’t work for them. Are you tell me LR takes the first $1M in second sales? That just do any make sense. All an artist has to do is set their creator royalties to whatever % they want and that’s what they’ll be paid
45,"@GeoffStengel @Nashrimpy @LooksRareNFT Trying to understand where you’re coming from. These platforms give creators a great or market to sell. Sure some could argue their secondary sale royalties should be higher than 10%, but they can also collect 100% of the initial sell"
46,@GeoffStengel @Nashrimpy @LooksRareNFT Royalty that they receive directly). Other platforms like Rarible actually charge creators an upfront fee to create/sell NFTs
47,@GeoffStengel @Nashrimpy @LooksRareNFT 1/2 We might be talking about two separate things. My understanding is several platforms like OS and LooksRare don’t charge creators to mint NFTs on their platforms - only on the backend do they take a percentage of the sale (with the creator given freedom to establish a creator
48,"@GeoffStengel @Nashrimpy @LooksRareNFT It has to be set on OS, too, not sure what the problem is. The creator is allow to establish the royalty as they see fit when creating a collection"
49,@GeoffStengel @Nashrimpy @LooksRareNFT It’s a setting the creator has to manually update…That’s not on the LooksRare team
