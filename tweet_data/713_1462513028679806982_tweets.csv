15,@Chris_Grosse Sko buffs. Boulder &gt; FOCO without a doubt. So this one for sure.
16,@dstarz_eth @tw1tte7 @lazy_sp @sartocheap_nft Plenty of better places to put your money if that’s the case. Not an elaborate cash grab
17,"@dstarz_eth @tw1tte7 @lazy_sp @sartocheap_nft Believe in “it”

As in the fabricated story behind why phunks have a type of significant meaning. They’re not fully decentralized, not even close. Also there’s videos on the internet of the creator talking about how he just pulled off this “elaborate cash grab”

GL"
18,@dstarz_eth @tw1tte7 @lazy_sp @sartocheap_nft And that’s why you’re saying Phunks are the bomb. Imagine the guy who bought your phunk and it’s now worth .4 eth. You’re biased
19,@tw1tte7 @dstarz_eth @lazy_sp @sartocheap_nft Facts^ like I said. Have fun being a whales exit liquidity.
20,"@SK1N @sartocheap_nft Still a toxic ass community that we, as mfers and mphers, are allowed to want to avoid. Phunks have plenty of haters cause of how they and their community members acted. I think beano is saying that let’s not open that can of worms. Phunks can and will bring this project to 0"
21,"@lazy_sp @tw1tte7 @dstarz_eth @sartocheap_nft Yes lol there’s so many bad players in the phunk space, that’s just the tip of the iceberg"
22,@rayway_eth @sartocheap_nft Wish you the best with that investment
23,@rayway_eth @sartocheap_nft Yeah cause the whales are ppl with decently active twitter followings. They’re constantly selling during pumps and don’t even think about calling them out for it. That’s what I did https://t.co/QLFjGiLJdz
24,@sartocheap_nft Why bring phunks into this 🤦🏼‍♂️ Phunks are toxic as hell. Bunch of whales dumping their bags. If you wanna be someone else’s exit liquidity go right ahead
25,@sartocheap_nft Nah phunks are toxic and are just a bunch of whales taking exit liquidity off poor newcomers in this space. This tweet is going to get a few people wrecked. DYOR ppl
26,@tw1tte7 @dstarz_eth @sartocheap_nft Agree with beano on this one. Ppl who don’t think Phunks are toxic havent been in this space long enough.

34,@BitcoinBaddiez My lungs are burning just reading that tweet 😮‍💨
35,@DillwoodJ @CryptoPhunksV2 Just proving my point that Phunks are the most toxic community in this space 🤣 Hope you have 10+ phunks cause those whales gonna be dumping on your ass when the price goes up again.
36,@DillwoodJ Hey you’re proving my point on the toxicity thing lol maybe you belong with them. Just hope you have 100+ Phunks just like the other whales. Cause one pump and they’re dumping on your ass 😆
37,@CryptoPhunksV2 Always whales taking exit liquidity out on newcomers in this space 😮‍💨
38,@BitcoinBaddiez You ain’t a stoner if you’re smoking out a bowl 😭 step ya game up G
39,@steve_abootman @CryptoPhunksV2 And thanks for proving my point on being toxic 😂😂
40,"@steve_abootman @CryptoPhunksV2 Lol I remember you, you’re one of the whales. Just warning the newcomers ✌️"
41,"@CryptoPhunksV2 Only active when they think it’ll benefit them. I’m sure we’re gonna see a wave of new phunk owners and with each one is a whale taking exit liquidity. GL if you buy a phunk

NGMI"
42,@CryptoPhunksV2 Toxic ass community here to revive their dead project cause their whale OGs want more profits lol
43,"@thisdefisntg @DillwoodJ @booter8 @sartocheap_nft @CryptoPhunksV2 @NotLarvaLabs It’s all bad but that last comment is what epitomizes the mindset in that community. “Is that the chick that had the zombie and sold early” 🤦🏼‍♂️ says a whale with 100+ phunks

They’re all laughing cause they’ve made 100k+ on phunks"

Sorry you bought someone else’s exit liquidity✌️"
47,"@BaGGZz_ @thisdefisntg @PRINTMYMINT Got my first phunk at .7 and was hodling through that big run a couple months ago til I realized the whole time I was hodling, all the major OGs were dumping their bags behind the scenes. And if you asked why they were selling multipl phunks a day you were accused of sell shaming"
48,@DillwoodJ @thisdefisntg @booter8 @sartocheap_nft @CryptoPhunksV2 @NotLarvaLabs You’re actually up in @booter8 tweets but go off queen
49,@thisdefisntg @BaGGZz_ @PRINTMYMINT Lmao how else are the OGs gonna unload the 100+ they minted if ppl like you keep fudding!!
50,@thisdefisntg @BaGGZz_ @PRINTMYMINT Hey but did you guys get the legendary NLL block? Didn’t think so 😤 https://t.co/Mx1jGnFrZi
51,@PRINTMYMINT Or if they weren’t the most toxic community in the space.. that might help a little as well 😂

53,@thisdefisntg @DillwoodJ @booter8 @sartocheap_nft @CryptoPhunksV2 @NotLarvaLabs Lmao see^ it’s a bunch of whales dumping their bags on poor newcomers in the space. Sorry but I called it out and they all got rude as fuck cause I was hurting their bags. It’s the truth.
54,"@DillwoodJ @booter8 @sartocheap_nft @CryptoPhunksV2 @NotLarvaLabs Actually I’m very well informed and am speaking from personal experience. But yeah you’re spot on, not a fan of the toxic phunk community. I also know others that think the same as me. No amount of phunks liking this guys tweet is gonna make this @DillwoodJ guy correct 😆"

81,@r_rainss So glad you found the strength to push forward and learn to live with the anxiety. Probably one of the hardest things you’ll ever have to do.
