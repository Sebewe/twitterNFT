17,Calling $77k $btc in late April / early May just for fun.
18,Idk if most people are ready for the state-sponsored $btc posturing
19,I am one bad decision away from blowing all my money on @ParallelNFT cards. The artwork is just so cool.
20,"@ginge_eth Yeah! I think for UX they are almost caught up with Opensea. I just have a lot of issues with metadata and renders not always displaying, but that's the last reservation I have with them."
21,I must have listened to this album a thousand times. Especially the last couple days in quarantine. https://t.co/2tlyN8SjZX
22,"@ottodv @nicksdjohnson They shouldn't, I agree with you. I have changed my mind since originally asking this."
23,"For anyone that may want to know, I voted for Brantly to be removed from the position of director because he didn't have the self awareness to know when he should just apologize and learn from mistakes, which is obviously important for anyone. Especially in such a public position"
24,"RT @nicksdjohnson: If you have $ENS tokens delegated to me, listen up!

I'm currently voting Abstain on EP6.1 due to my conflict of interes…"
25,@nicksdjohnson That's a fair point. Just have to let it play out it seems.
26,"@nicksdjohnson Yeah this feels like a lose-lose unfortunately. It looks bad for him to have 50% of the votes to keep himself, and it looks bad to change the vote."
27,@nicksdjohnson Sorry but I have to ask. Are we going to count Brantly's vote on this? Shouldn't he not be allowed to determine the outcome of this?
28,Infinitely concentric layers of abstraction
29,"@Falcon_Pr0ject @nicksdjohnson I see that you hold 1231 $ENS token but for some reason, like you said, you are showing 0 votes on WithTally. Did you get your tokens from the airdrop or another way?"

Yeah the bots are crazy. I tried not to use any key words that trigger them. 😑"
98,@coinkid2000 @coinbase Do you use a decentralized wallet to hold yours? If there is a good one I might drop some art on #Tezos
