26,@954px So it would not be as smooth / fluid / as good of sound quality for any songs that aren't Kanye/stems on release for the stem player. As it's harder for software to split songs into stems without having the master recordings I'd imagine. It looks cool though as a concept.
27,"@954px That's for his songs, the stem player uses some software on a backend server to split songs into stems if they aren't already stems. So what I mean is that any of Kanye songs will come as stems already and be made that way, while other mp3s from other artists would not be."
28,@954px Idk man. For files / songs that aren't from Kanye / his team it wont be able to separate the layers (vocals etc) as well as songs that come from him / his team that can be separated properly as made to be from the start. But you know i'm a skeptic of everything.
