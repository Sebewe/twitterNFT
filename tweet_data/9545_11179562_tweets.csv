0,I feel like the minimum age for Euphoria needs to be like 30
1,@_FudAssassin_ I’d prefer this honestly. I’ve been rugged before and there are people in the discord still months later saying it wasn’t a rug just bad planning. Some people need it spelled out directly.
2,Am I crazy or is there a new @opensea exploit every other week?
3,I’m so ready for my Kanye West era.
4,@bubzylive I don’t know why I find this so funny 😂
5,"Thinking about going all in on no-code x web3 product building. Originally I didn’t think it was possible but over time I’ve seen just enough individual pieces, that put together the right way, can get it done."
6,@0xApes_NFT 👀
7,@FurqanR @thirdweb_ Cool. Thanks for the reply!
8,"@thirdweb_ This is awesome! 

Off topic question, is there plans in the roadmap to customize the embedded mint widget?"
9,"@MichaelJNovotny It's because you have a data type set on whatever page you're referring to. I could be wrong, but that's the only time I've even seen the ""data to send"" option"
10,I wish this was false https://t.co/Z6u7wBtCCY
11,"@thirdweb_ *proceeds to go to computer”
🏃🏾‍♂️💻"
12,@_FudAssassin_ @0xApes_NFT Count me in 🤠
13,@hexagonxyz @metavatar_app lifeasjohn.eth
14,If the tinder swindler was into NFTs he’d be having a field day with some of y’all right now.
15,@0xApes_NFT Thank goodness I got in a week ago!
16,@ImAbout2Ape @0xApes_NFT Never listed 🤫🟨🟨🟨
17,@fineapple22_ https://t.co/urD4FimdOW
18,@mecdot Same energy
19,@_brandonhatcher I highkey want this 😅
20,@OzarkNFT @grouchy_peanut @LazyLionsNFT I found LL because of you. That’s foul
21,"@WillWhittenton Absolutely not, and that's part of the problem. Why we gotta be so complicated lol"
22,"@WillWhittenton To be fair, I'd probably hate the competitor too. It's not just the platform itself. I miss the simple platforms like Monday and Trello. I do love Confluence though so there's some benefit."
23,Just wanted to come on here and say how much I hate Jira.
24,Not everything needs to be a joke or have a comedic undertone. Somethings have a serious tone for a reason.
25,When was the last time a new sport was invented? I’m thinking @Spikeball but I could be wrong.
26,@mauriceminor88 @_quitaM I really should though 😂
27,Thinking about selling all of my NFTs (~100) and just starting over.
28,@crispylines Literally had this thought last night
29,@TwitterBlue I never wait. Always send now 🤫
30,Getting an oculus quest today. What games/experiences should I try first?
31,@vlptuouz Kind of new but I’m working on it!
32,What I really wanted to say is it’s giving “pick me” vibes. https://t.co/uCO5nvM8xP
33,"I can’t wrap my head around web 2 platforms being against NFTs because a loud part of their customer base is against it. 

Ask me how many times I have used Facebook marketplace – none. But I know so many people that love and benefit from it. 

The whole thing seems weird to me."
34,Honestly…I think I’d time to start publicly burning bridges. I like being on my own island anyways. https://t.co/xGSB1boFVN
35,I just typed out a Twitter thread about something that’s been weighting on me for a year now…and then deleted it. 🙃
36,I cannot explain this phenomenon but I have eaten an ice cream sandwich every night for the last week
37,@web3paid Hi 👋
38,@0xApes_NFT Hi 👋
39,"Don't fight me, but I know some of y'all be lying about these wordles."
40,I think it'd be cool if @Snapchat made it possible for anyone to create and upload serialized content. I'm kind of over the Daily Mail and influencer drama channels.
41,@OzarkNFT Happy Birthday king 👑
42,"@matteomosca_ @thirdweb_ I will say, you may need some understanding of some code to connect the backend to a website/ui. But all the smart contracts are taken care of. @NiftyKitApp is a great option as well but only for NFT drops"
43,"To all of my no-code friends that are also interested in web3, I advise you to look into @thirdweb_"
44,"@WillWhittenton Okay, I'm sorry I forgot to text you back a few days ago. it was an honest mistake. I have accepted, learned and grown."
45,@Jeremy00675424 No
46,@LeoAlhalabi @0xApes_NFT Hi! ✌️
47,"If I launched my own NFT project, my goal would be to make you happy not to make you rich."
48,Within the blink of an eye I’ve spent 2.5 ETH on NFTs over the last few weeks. I need to slow down. Or do I keep going 🤔
49,"Ordered my Oculus Quest today, so I guess I'll wander around the metaverse alone until @sparksc3 gets it together."
50,@_brandonhatcher Some people are better at sniping than others I guess.
51,@_brandonhatcher Dang. Better luck next time 😔
52,Is this still available for purchase? Asking for a friend @_brandonhatcher https://t.co/KbDqtZliQu
53,Something around derivative projects with yellow backgrounds really get me thinking. @0xApes_NFT and @ExpansionPunks are really the move.
54,@FaZeBlaze Porsche 911 992 Turbo S
55,I feel like 2022 is going to be the breakout year for @0xPolygon
56,Have to give a shoutout to the birthday boy @_brandonhatcher. Good luck on the launch today!
57,Accidentally bought an NFT twice because I got an error message from @opensea but apparently the transaction actually went through. 🙃
58,@matteomosca_ Wait... I recognize this. I definitely used your tutorial last year for making a Google Chrome plugin. Good stuff!
59,"@matteomosca_ I can already tell just from playing around, Web3 + nocode will be the most fun corner of the internet this year!"
60,"How my Twitter journey started:
Gaming ➡️ No-Code ➡️ Crypto

My Twitter journey now:
Gaming ➕ No-Code ➕ Crypto"
61,My toxic trait is hiding the 36 open tabs I have in 4 tab groups to make it look like less tabs are open.
62,@bubzylive I never got my move in date but whatever
63,"@MichaelJNovotny I've seen this way more often than you'd think. 90% of the time, it was someone who wasn't familiar with no-code basically needing reassurance. I think some people think just because no-code is the way it is, that it doesn't scale the way they may need it to."
64,@_quitaM Now why you feel the need to put me on blast like that
65,I have never played wordle. AMA
66,"Winter storm coming through Texas and probably going to lose power. Do I make an impulse decision to go to Miami?

For context, last year I sat in my apartment for 4 days with no heat, electricity or running water."
67,I’ll never understand these insane WL grinds for NFT projects. Like do you want people in your community or no?
68,Completely forgot I have fractional ownership of both BAYC #8827 &amp; MAYC #5750. Am I doing this NFT thing right or what?
69,2/2/22
70,After being up at 6am (thanks insomnia) for the last 2 weeks I can in fact confirm there are no birds or worms. They lied
71,I honestly may tattoo this tweet on my body. It’s so true. https://t.co/bviyh4OKJp
72,"@barkerdestefano To grow a portfolio. The roadmap is 1/2 ideas that I've had over the the last year but haven't had time to refine the ideas.

2nd half is I have a skill or technology I want to learn and I thought of a use case using that tech so I have something to work towards while learning."
73,"Refined this plan to be ~9-10 product launches with a good mixture of no-code, coded and web3 products. Trying to balance my portfolio with what I already know and the things I'm trying to learn. https://t.co/MdF9uXMQDQ"
74,"In the year 2022 we collect Coinbase Commerce accounts, not Stripe accounts."
75,@MichaelJNovotny Is it supposed to be like growth tools &amp; marketing? Because I could get behind that.
76,@MichaelJNovotny A platform with marketing advice for growing other growth platforms?
77,"After being having an NFT pfp for one day I finally see the appeal. There’s so many thoughts I had that I never tweeted because “John would never say that. 

But a frosty ape with an orange beanie and tweed suit, he most definitely might say that 😂"
78,Sorry in advance @coleman_dixon 😈
79,"The most encouraging feeling is that even though I’ve had a lot of “friends” let me down in a major way over the last year, I never let myself down."
80,I can’t stop laughing. I just checked my mail and I have a wedding invitation 😂 https://t.co/ITCPnlvzDV
81,What are some good NFT projects at or below the 1 ETH mark?
82,@eml2014 @AnatomySAC Let me know if you end up selling it just so I don’t accidentally sell it again.
83,Guess I’ll join NFT Twitter now 😑 #NewNFTProfilePic @AnatomySAC https://t.co/gXfo5WbL4Q
84,Spent the better part of the day tilted because the webcam on my new laptop stopped working. Turns out that I had accidently hit the built in camera cover that I didn't know existed. I promise I'm smart.
85,@LukeCres7 This actually looks clean. I lowkey want it 😅
86,@lukecannon727 My favorite tweet I've seen today by far
87,Planning out my projects for the next 6 months. Either I have a solid game plan or this wine is really doing it's job.
88,Getting an alert from UPS that you're receiving a package but you don't know what it is because you didn't order anything is probably the most toxic thing I've ever encountered.
89,"I think it's funny how, after everyone is eligible for a free at home test, all the covid tests on doordash went from $100+ to $25. 

So it could've been $25 the whole time right?"
90,@mattragland @savvycal You should look into @Cron. Really beautiful interface and super intuitive. I love it as a calendar management tool.
91,@mikedemarais Hi
92,@HunterMitchem @DrifterShoots This is definitely way more insane than it looks
93,"Had a recruiter cold pitch me on a role. Their pitch: ""The company has never had layoffs""

Is this what we're selling now? The bare minimum."

Some random dude on the internet: gm, this should be an NFT ser 🅿️"

96,Are any one my friends getting married soon? It’s been awhile since I’ve been drunk on a dance floor embarrassing my friend’s in front of their grandparents. I need that back.
97,Don't you think it's crazy that there are people who think all water tastes the same.
98,"You'll get it when you get it
-FedEx https://t.co/XN4eDeHINg"
99,"A big improvement @FedEx could have is  predictive intelligence or AI. 

I have a package I was supposed to receive yesterday; scheduled to be delivered today....but its 450 miles away with only a few hours left in the day.

I think we all know this isn't possible. So why say it?"
