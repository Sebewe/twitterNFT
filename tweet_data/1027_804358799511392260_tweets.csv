5,@bitpixi Walking is also good for loosening the back. Sit less. Take time throughout the day to stand stretch and move around. I know kids suck at letting you take care of your back especially if you’re always lifting them but you gotta do the things to keep limber
6,"@JohnOrionYoung has been the best part of NFTs for me. Always chill and easy going, good vibes and endless original entertaining content 
(Oh and he’s a musician and a philosopher) https://t.co/LzxyUTJM8L"
7,"@avsa @opensea Don't let anyone guilt trip you into giving away a valuable NFT. It's not profiteering to sell a desirable asset at a time when others are wanting it. It's smart investing. This is how markets work. 
If someone thinks Ukraine should own your NFT, they can buy it for Ukraine"
8,"@AndrewSteinwold What happens if Satoshi is a Kremlin program. They've been planning decades ahead of time with other measures such as building massive gold reserves, testing EU resolve with the Crimea invasion, and Ukraine nuclear disarmament"

Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

15,"Actually I only collect OG work from “first” projects because they do stay verifiably rare. @JohnOrionYoung @CryptoKitties Austrian cryptostamps, @pranksy art, @DeepBlackAI . 
I do consider them financial investment.
This is not financial advice.

17,"Fight to find opposing views. Follow people you disagree with. Building an echo chamber is dangerous in pretty much any aspect of life. Force yourself to think critically and build ideals that can survive criticism, that you can live by."
18,@Dat_Ogar allocate investments with eyes wide open realization of unlimited downsides. Hedge risks outside of individual sectors e.g. crypto and equities. Be overcollateralized for any unforseen circumstances to maintain family health and well being.
19,"This is Mechel, a Russian mining company. It dropped 45% after hours. It now has a P/E of 1.4 and a dividend of 1.1

23,"@JasonPLowery China changed ""miner"" to ""soldier"" and kicked them all out of the country."
24,@QueenCryptoria Pretty sure those were the original pfp
25,"@QueenCryptoria We talk a lot about ""community"" in NFTs and why they ""add to value."" But that's just it. Communities don't exist to make you richer. If that is the case, then they won't outlast a downturn. Real communities are built on common respect and support, not a passing common interest"
26,@QueenCryptoria Don't be too hard on yourself. Your tweet still reads like Encyclopedia Britannica compared to mine and I also pay lol. I just use those extra 10 seconds to have a long drink of coffee and then notice once it's live that it's a hot mess
27,"Russian proposed legislation wants you to pass a test before you can trade crypto on a custodial exchange. Let's try a sample question.
""If you have 1 ETH do you..."
28,"@QueenCryptoria My NFTs were either given away in community contests or to winners of charity auctions... but that's not what seems to grab excitement for most people. They want to be in a crowd of 20,000 all fighting to get through the same door"

31,@NostroEth @CryptoKitties @opensea I just liked having a hobby and weird smart internet frens.
32,"Remember when there was only an NFT event every other weekend? Because that was when the @CryptoKitties fancy chase was? 
And you could scroll every project on @opensea on one sidebar even ones with 1 eth total volume?
Those times felt more sane and healthy. https://t.co/DkQD5GPydJ"
33,@AltcoinGordon I hope you're Putin your money where your mouth is
34,"@basedkarbon Kitties never went ""very high"" compared to any blue chip of this cycle. What they had was tens of thousands of users making hundreds to thousands of transactions which made for high net volume. The most premium kitties are still cheap by even brand new NFT standards."
35,"@RagingBitcoin It's best to be wise, see value in opposing arguments, and practice empathy."
36,@SpacedPainter any neighborhood can fall victim to hard economic times and become the newest ghetto. It'll happen fastest in areas where prices got the most inflated. Social problems can't be resolved by market values.
37,"further: your car is also leased in as much as you want to drive it on public roads and pay to keep it registered and insured. Law enforcement can seize your vehicle, and anything in it. Your gold might be safe, but only as long as you can keep it secret. Ownership is illusion."
38,@PeterSchiff @RichardHeartWin Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
39,"To those who say that owning real estate is something ""real"" compared to owning cryptocurrency: you've clearly never owned real estate. R/E is owned by government. You pay taxes to lease the land. And it's one lawsuit, eminent domain, or corrupt politician away from being seized"
40,"Stay anon. The internet was scary enough before Web3. If you are harassing project leads because your NFT value isn’t rising, shame on you. Do the awareness work and value pitching yourself. https://t.co/TO3ncYrTba"
41,"To further clarify: peaceful protest and political activism should always be the first resort. 
However, we are seeing an utter failure of these measures.
Simply, the legacy governing structures have nothing to lose by continuing on their quest to seize absolute power."
42,"This is crypto's moment. Not the ""let's get rich quick and cash out moment."" Not the ""let's blow everything on NFT spinoffs and rugs."" The ""how much do we value freedom and want to secure our families' futures against government tyranny. https://t.co/HJFTnUJqXZ"

45,"FB is now our grandparents platform. 
Discord is a madhouse only good for private communities.
Instagram Snapchat Periscope Tiktok and YouTube serve different utilities.
Reddit is broken due to the karma system and mod cartels.

49,@bitpixi Gotta try to force that lower back to relax. Take time to stretch during the day. Bend over arms loose and breathe then very slowly straighten back upright. End of day lay on your back arms out straight like a cross then take turns crossing each leg over to the opposite side

56,@zerohedge Lol’ing in vegetarian
57,@geggleto Nah we're finally seeing why China just controls the entire internet and North Korea doesn't have it. It's awfully inconvenient for those being governed to start asking questions and thinking critically.
58,"@RaoulGMI Discord was made for gaming. Not as a vehicle to corner you as a product, getting chased down nonstop and assaulted by everyone trying to sell you the latest project/scam. Crypto broke Discord. But now we are left with Twitter, dominated by the voices of influencers."
