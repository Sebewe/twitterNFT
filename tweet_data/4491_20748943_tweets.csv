53,@CrypticFelix @LooksRareNFT And https://t.co/gOe1LZK4dm existing is the main reason why I decided to ape into LR again after the dip.
54,"@CrypticFelix @LooksRareNFT Now that I think about it, the ""users will use the platform with the most liquidity"" suggests that https://t.co/gOe1LZK4dm wins over OS. It becomes a question of ""can they market successfully?"" But if they do, LR wins because you rather only list on LR because rewards and 2% fee"
55,"@CrypticFelix @LooksRareNFT Have you considered the scenario where eyeballs migrate to an NFT marketplace aggregator like https://t.co/gOe1LZK4dm? In that case, what do you do? Do you list on both or do you guarantee income listing on the marketplace that shares fees and trading rewards?"
56,"@CrypticFelix @LooksRareNFT Bottom line, if coordination is done right, the optimal outcome is we all unlist OS and re-list LR. Volume is forced to migrate, we all swim together in 2%-fee ETH cash-flows. We don't do this, we continue using a platform we don't own streaming fees to VC anons."
57,"@CrypticFelix @LooksRareNFT The (defect, defect) outcome occurs when the parties are unable to coordinate. Have you ever visited Discord or CT, ser?"
58,"@CrypticFelix @LooksRareNFT Ah, when we run out of arguments we resort to intellectual deprecation."
59,"@CrypticFelix @LooksRareNFT Again you're forcing an imperfect analogy. The (defect, defect) equilibrium outcome occurs in a Prisoner's Dilemma type game, which is unparalleled here. BTW, you're assuming outright that if you list only on LR your NFT won't sell."
60,"@CrypticFelix @LooksRareNFT A coordinated OS vampire attack guarantees that we all own those cash flows as partners under the immutable rules. OHM was a completely different, inferior beast."
61,"@CrypticFelix @LooksRareNFT Ah, now I get where the bitterness originates. You bought into the good old 3,3. 3,3 never made sense because the market cap you thought you had equity in was artificial. In @LooksRareNFT you have continuously streaming ETH cash flows. U r buying and compounding future cash flows"
62,@CrypticFelix @LooksRareNFT Game theory suggests that if we all do this together we all own the platform that has the majority volume

69,"@CrypticFelix @LooksRareNFT If you get additional money for trading on LR and pay less fees, wouldn't you prefer for it so sell on LR? It'll sell eventually anyway. Markets are efficient just in that sense."
70,I have a hunch this can be parameterized on a contract that runs multiple transactions atomically.
71,"Oh, and reimburse the gas for revoking on OS as well. They kinda did the second half of this yesterday, but the individual signature thing was kind of annoying. Find a way to do it in bulk and you win."
72,I'll never get tired of suggesting this to @LooksRareNFT. THE feature we need to do a real vampire attack and migrate liquidity is a button that revokes permission to sell on OpenSea and approves LR. Then push all signatures at once instead of having to click on each NFT. 👇
73,"Also inspected deployment of all their smart contracts. They seamed to have deployed a couple contracts twice (Presale and Proxy). Vulnerable? Don't like proxy contracts though, as it makes users vulnerable by definition. Immutability which is the basis of web3 (to me) is lost."
74,"Read the @the_x2y2 whitepaper. Don't think it will fly. Airdrop seems to be safe (I'll provide details later), but NFT listing is vulnerable in the unlikely case the devs decide they want to steal them. Recommend https://t.co/cC1L0jv7si after listing to get the airdrop. 👇"
75,It should only be called a vampire attack if they provide a mechanism to migrate liquidity easily. Meaning they provide a button to revoke allowances to move your NFTs listed on OpenSea and simultaneously re-list and reimburse gas fees (similar to what @LooksRareNFT is doing now) https://t.co/aIM024bd8K
