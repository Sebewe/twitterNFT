21,"@schmupergirl @TheStarsPodcast @awo211 @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys So its just adding the timestamped value to everything else? Sorry just getting up to speed. But, if that is the case, I can see it being a pain and the need to reduce whatever they added errantly."
22,@schmupergirl @TheStarsPodcast @awo211 @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys Hmm I would think the tokens you still hold generally are not taxable until the position is closed - but I’m not a tax pro
23,@TheStarsPodcast @awo211 @schmupergirl @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys Yo! If I have it right you’re asking about how to value airdrops for taxes?

55,@TheStarsPodcast https://t.co/tDQy9MKyTa
56,@harrisonfirst How about a relatively low effort but scalable way for a collector to share their music? This model allows for ownership but relies solely on the artist to drive value when the collector can promote as well..

86,"@HOUNDTRACK @MisterMcClenney @AudiusProject We talked about that and I love remix challenges, but the problem is this: Web3 grants ownership, but the promo and awareness still falls on the artist when really it should be shared to an extent.
