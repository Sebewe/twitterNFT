3,@DCLBlogger RPO was still under one domain (Gregarious Games). A better representation is Sword Art Online. Pretty amazing how well they nailed the Metaverse concept considering it was created in 2012!!!
4,"@chelseamealo Down cycles are hard to break sometimes. Hold tight, stay strong 🧡"
5,"@0xBender I understand the intent of this thread but I don't agree with this point. I believe that doxxing has become necessary. Again, this is not the only checkpoint but for a basic NFT project launch the viability of the project hinges almost entirely on the team."
6,"@0xBender The nuance here is becoming more important with each project launch. At this stage in the NFT lifecycle, an undoxxed team is definitely a red flag. This, however, does not mean that a doxxed team should automatically receive a stamp of approval."

You'll love your A7iii and if you run into any issues or have questions feel free to DM me (I've been shooting with mine for a while now... I LOVE it)
9,@lilmahnaji Thank you @lilmahnaji 🧡🧡🧡
10,Both of these new pieces can be found in my Lucidity collection 🧡 https://t.co/YV1RMPv4oX
11,"We do a lil minting 🧡

Without having sold any work (yet) I've been hesitant to mint new pieces, but after further reflection, that's just me making excuses for not putting my work out to the world.

This morning I listed ""Flow State"" and ""Into the Unknown"". I hope you enjoy! https://t.co/n36zNbjFGB"
12,Felt underexposed in @tubbycatsnft so added this bucket hat boy to the team 🧡 https://t.co/PfuNDkl8if

16,@DCLBlogger Added feature: can tell the duration of ownership (so you can't just keep transferring NFT for access)

26,"@erubes1 @strangersxyz I'm feeling some photography vibes, some creative vibes. Sounds exciting!"
27,"@krybharat The key is the transition of NFTs away from collectible and towards real-life utility. As long as they are a security/asset, greed will reign supreme. When an NFT is only worth $50 but gets you into a movie or access to a product, then the money grab slows and builders can build."

45,"@farokh The ""diamond hands"" narrative has rekt too many people. It's not fud to sell an asset 😂

I sold the @tubbycatsnft I minted then bought back one I vib'd with more for 1/2 price. I'm happy to do that all day long."
46,@mindzeye I have no idea what kind of witchcraft you perform in post but OMG this shot is amazing!
47,@Zeneca_33 @farokh Most of the complaints I saw was around the WL grind tactics.
48,My Toad is still my og !vibe but my Tubby just gets me.
49,"@MoonOverlord 20k is the new 10k. @bobbyhundreds was one of the first but @RTFKTstudios, @BoredApeYC MAYC, @RugRadio + others are building incredible communities with the larger numbers."
50,"@farokh @MoonOverlord The community has also grown since last year. There is more space for growth. It seems crazy right now but as the NFT space grows, we could/should see 50k mints by the end of this year."
51,"@tubbycatsnft Also, it's hard to go against a project that @MoonOverlord has conviction on."
52,"I'm really vibn w/ @tubbycatsnft rn. The collection is just great, end to end. It is starting to become obvious which projects are created by NFT natives and which aren't.

Before today I sold the only one I owned by now I have 1 of 2 Ghosts, 1 of 7 Eggs and one I just vibe with. https://t.co/00FKQfYfjS"

55,@jaimedelpizz0 gm 🧡
56,@MoonOverlord The combination quality art/ quality pfp is key. The only other collection that has matched traits/colors this well is @RTFKTstudios CloneX. Most of the collection truly looks rare and a quarter of the collection looks like they could be 1/1s.
57,@punk6529 So much validation tho
58,@camille_du_bois gn
59,@chelseamealo What a beautiful shot! That amazing door pulls the image together perfectly.
60,@MoonOverlord This is so true! I was on the list and have no idea how I got there.
61,@tobylasso Sending 🧡 and support. I hope the true nature of this community is able to be there for you as you find strength and move forward.
62,I've balanced my portfolio with NFTs and AFTs 😂 https://t.co/MA9glYJkmI
63,"I think the coordination of color and traits in the @tubbycatsnft collection is one of the best I've seen so far. There are floor cats that look like 1/1s. Very well done!

(I don't own any... this is just a bystander's observation)"

71,@GuidoDisalle You also opened the edition from 100 to 250. Plenty of space to let fans become collectors! 🧡
72,"@hayleyshorizons @TimBacaWeather And if there happened to be cloud cover, you would have had to do it all over again. I love and appreciate this shot!"

This means you have to do the work but your reward will be proportional to the value you create."
79,@chriscantino + open to community contributions @RTFKTstudios
