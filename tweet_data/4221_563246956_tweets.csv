10,"@adamscochran is always on point. Besides being one of the best sources of alpha you can get, governance (or even just getting involved) can be one of the most fulfilling parts of web3, and is not restricted to those with computer software backgrounds. https://t.co/tSuG4mpzGE"

12,@gcockfoster Strong communities build strong communities! 💪
13,"@cpaik Agreed. I think it's a very traditional way to think about it. We should want everyone to join the metaverse, not restrict it in the same way many people are currently locked out of society. The value comes from growing community!"
14,@ericabrescia @jonobacon That's very sweet!
15,@iamwhitelights @billelis Congrats!! Welcome to the club 🤗
16,"@alexisohanian Fascinating how we've come full circle to GameStop. My inner child is delighted, but worries that if I want to sell my NFT back to them, I'll only get $.90 for it."
17,@jasoncwarner This is the most American measuring system I've ever heard of😂
18,"@Hellachans Who do they think they are, having fun and liking jpegs??"
19,@oak_arrow Amazing work👏 Happy to have it in my space collection.
20,@tommyk_eth @duckdarryl @niftygateway Things go south they may have to call in @Ness_Graphics to save them... 😂
21,"@localghost 💯 Percent. Some games will, some games won't and that's all ok."
22,@LukeYoungblood This looks amazing!! Gotta get mine uploaded!
23,"@GuyZalaxy @DeezeFi Invest in others, and they will invest in you."
24,I've started writing my #web3 thoughts down in a new blog (https://t.co/aCalCmSGK3)👀using the awesome toolkit from @viamirror. Hopefully it's helpful for those getting into the space or trying to learn more about what's new in the industry!

27,@cburniske I feel like surfing lessons might be in order then for me..
28,@jasoncwarner Just send it to my wallet and I'll double check for you😉
29,"@CryptoKaleo Good luck, you got this!"
30,@_tim0x Yup😂
31,@Abimbola_Adanri @wesofficial Come clean!
32,One of my favorite things about #web3 : some of my favorite artists coming together for an awesome show to showcase their amazing work 👏👏 https://t.co/TsG13hu8Gy
33,@wesofficial This is the way.
34,@CountessDeBardi Signed with the finest quill I could find.
35,@localghost All the news this week on nfts feels like momentum building. Will be really interesting to see what happens after the doors are wide open!
36,@localghost So stoked for this. I think people underestimate how impactful this could be.
37,@kwuchu Love it
38,"@ericabrescia @jonobacon Hard bias here, but as an office professional I'm voting for yours @ericabrescia 😂"
39,"@CroissantEth @Eichenkundiger This undersells how much cash msft has on hand. They have to buy companies like this, and can hold long term, especially if it ties into a deeper strategy."
40,@mdo So glad you're ok my dude.
41,@alexisohanian That's freaking sweet. Loved the original cartoon.
42,@Ry_Hawthorne 🔥🔥
43,@planetzomax Will my space man helmet have a seat on board?

66,@Ness_Graphics @Mad_Dog_Jones @farokh @planetzomax These are awesome pieces!
67,@sergitosergito @raoulmarks It's amazing 😍
68,"@jasoncwarner Yeah I think that makes good sense. Spirit of crypto with protection options. I also think there is a whole other train of thought that crypto only goes mainstream when people don't know they are actually using it, and it just operates in the background."
69,@lg Happy new year!
70,"@jasoncwarner Do you think we just see ""trusted"" financial partners such as banks leverage things like DeFi on the backend to increase returns, or is there some middle ground where people can opt in to a range of personal responsibility and freedom with the associated risks?"
71,@alexisohanian Good god that's awesome 😍
