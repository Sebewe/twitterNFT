53,"@jenkinsthevalet @JenkinsMutated OG @jenkinsthevalet for me, but love the banter @JenkinsMutated!"
54,"Many #PFPs are like the paper stock certificates of old - these #NFT projects are communities, brands, DAOs and companies just getting started! The NFT picture is the bonus visual ticket to partipate in the ride."
55,"There is lots of FOMO in the #NFT space and buying/selling rules are necessary. If you can, buy 2 for projects and causes you love, and just 1 if it's a good investment, but not near and dear to your heart. Never more than you can afford to lose!"

78,We have such a great opportunity on the building groud up to correct past biases and improve inclusion from the start. #WAGMI and let's work together to make the space feel welcome to all!
79,"For example, if the #NFT team is giving away a @ROLEX, also give away a @CHANEL purse. If your #PFP avatar art features only menswear, diversify with some dresses."
80,"So many #PFP #NFT projects could benefit from adding a few more female characteristics and projects, and cater prizes and rewards that attract wider demographics."
81,"To get more #womenincrypto, we need to integrate #Diversity in more projects to better reflect the world we live in, not just have separate female-only collections."
