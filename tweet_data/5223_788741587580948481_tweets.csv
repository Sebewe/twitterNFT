6,@thevisualdon @Adobe Wow I’ve never seen this sort of cancellation before? I always call them to work something out. It never hurts to ask if there’s anything they can do!

19,12 ETH floor price 👏🏽 dang.
20,"@mscorsteezy The art is great, it’s definitely one of the prettier 3D collections I’ve seen. Only complaint is the WL if you didn’t hold other projects"
21,@torbjornloperss If you got WL then that’s awesome!
22,"@torbjornloperss No idea, my Twitter feed is 50% FUD around the project and 50% aping into it 🤷🏽‍♀️"

31,@diogosampaioART WOAH
32,I have no more sympathy for the IG accounts that have been hacked recently. Dude you haven’t talked to in 8 years is asking you to click a link to help him out? You might as well send money to that Nigerian prince in your spam.
33,"@jamestralie That’s amazing, congratulations!!!"
34,That green tick. Does this means this work has been selected? Or is there another round of selection after this? @mondoir https://t.co/TS954gsokt
35,"@mondoir Love to see it, I hope more people in the space give back like this if they can!"
36,"@MyRugema If it’s a new project from people I’ve never heard of, I’d rather they have a roadmap. So if I get fucked over at least they put effort into the rug 😂"

97,"@NathanHeadPhoto Love the art + it's backed by a solid team, but WL culture in general is so toxic atm and then the overpriced merch raffle thing ruined the vibe. I just hope it doesn't set a standard for all projects to be like this in 2022."
