89,the community on twitter and discord are also some of the most inclusive and welcoming and engaging i've ever seen. there really is something magical here and i'm excited to see the project continue to evolve and grow this year and beyond ❤️
90,"after i bought lacerta, i realized there are now 0 witches for sale that have the same green mage serpent script. every single one is being held. the same can be said for so many other traits as well."
91,"i have to believe a lot of this stems from the power of representation, and how many of us have finally found an nft profile picture that looks like us. that, and of course, every witch is gorgeous regardless."
92,"to me, one of the most impressive and powerful things about crypto coven is the conviction of coven members. so many of us are so passionate about the project and so genuinely in love with the art."
93,"@crypto_coven as web3 reaches mainstream adoption and more and more diverse populations participate, women-led and women-centric collections like the coven will continue to receive much-deserved attention and absolutely explode"
94,@crypto_coven is still massively undervalued... easily the most gorgeous pfp collection out there right now. bullish so you know i had to go all-in on this mage-scripted beauty– meet lacerta 🧙🏻‍♀️✨ https://t.co/IOhJdmkNvP https://t.co/Z6GjeLO14S
