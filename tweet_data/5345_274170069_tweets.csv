38,@PAttacking @TheFiremind88 @Bartechnos @cat5749 @davidbankless I doubt that any existing game will implement tokens or NFTs but over the coming years AAA studios will definitely experiment with it to see what works. No company wants to be the first to try out a new tech risking hundreds of millions but they also don't want to miss out.

48,"@___sneakmex Weirdest trade i made was when I was 14 and met a 40 year old man at the public library to make the transaction. We logged into the account, he got the info and changed the password and payed me cash. It went smooth but in hindsight it really could have ended badly 😂"
49,"@PAttacking @DefiPlumbus @Bartechnos @cat5749 @davidbankless I mean right now almost all games are set up to only have money come into the game with no way of players benefitting. Imagine if you could sell a Fortnite skin for example, it adds actual value to an item. It could all be done on an in-game marketplace using a token."
