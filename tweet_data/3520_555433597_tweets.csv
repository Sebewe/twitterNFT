54,@robtax5 @paulguynj @Ann_Chavie @MuellerSheWrote @ManhattanDA I think it’s presumptuous to assume either conviction or not.  I haven’t seen the evidence so I don’t assume “never” or “will happen”

67,@robtax5 @MuellerSheWrote @ManhattanDA Ummm.  Manhattan DA isn’t the state AG office.  Trump will assert the 5th which by his own estimation (not mine) is an admission of guilt.  He will lose all appeals and will never hold public office.  Pin this tweet.
