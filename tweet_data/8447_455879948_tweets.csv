27,@aeyakovenko @bluekirbyfi @FedorovMykhailo How would a Solana node operator and validator go about blocking these addresses from consensus?
28,@FedorovMykhailo Nah fuck off
29,"@aeyakovenko @balajis @EliBenSasson Exactly. Uncensorable, immutable, etc doesn’t mean there aren’t real life consequences. But it serves to keep the state at bay, where there are viable private alternatives."
30,@statelayer @mikedemarais Can confirm
31,@Cointelegraph @ethdenver So

42,@owocki @ErikVoorhees You seen how shutting down energy has fared for European nat gas prices? This isn’t just a quick ‘fix’ of shutting something down

63,@crypt0e Wen attack? Soon tm
64,@twobitidiot Hear me out. A fake OS contract that takes peoples NFTs and then sells them.
65,@defidude Sounds like Twitter Blue linked email is another chance. Pure 100% speculation
66,@defidude Could’ve used the list from the Ledger hack? Am sure there’s a big enough overlap
67,Prediction: In 2022 and beyond the negative Tether FUD will be replaced with an extremely favorable view of people like @paoloardoino who actively lock down hacked funds but refuse to bend the knee to authoritarian regimes like Canada. The best of both worlds.

82,"@iBobbyShell @sassal0x Neat talking points but that’s all you’ve provided.

Focus on facts.

Eth PoS by having PoW distribution first is very decentralized

BUT (here you go), CB, Kraken, Lido majority of stake

And Prysm &gt; 65% client

THESE are issues worth addressing (and fixing)"
83,@ErikVoorhees I kinda like the chia pet one where we burned company hard drives. I mean personal hard drives.
84,@theDAOKING Meh I’m arguing against her other thread not the one you tagged so … uhhhh … Homer Simpson meme ill see myself out
85,"@theDAOKING Neither are really feasible at the scale of BTC or ETH, but PoS on Ethereum includes slashing, which raises the cost of a continued attack on the network, causing loss of control.
The queue to enter/withdraw from the staking contract also provides transparency before an attack"

99,"@iamDCinvestor Not good vs the alts 
TIPS are more liquid and no penalty to get out early
If you’re long term in nature and that point doesn’t apply, then I’d argue you should make better risk adjusted investments to beat inflation, not match it
Plus: pegging to CPI is a risk itself"
