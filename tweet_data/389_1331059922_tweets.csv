39,"@utility_maxi @coolcatsnft Working on a writeup for this rn, there were a couple fishy transactions in those 29 minutes"
40,The only opinion I'm going to insert about it is that it would be extremely easy to find given the team told us exactly what to look for with a matic token and a 200eth liquidity pool that we knew the name of. Congrats if you cashed in early.
41,It's a little crazy to me how nobody is talking about the fact that there was over 30 million $milk exchanged prior to the public announcement of it in the Discord. The first transaction was for 17.1m milk within minutes of liquidity being added.
