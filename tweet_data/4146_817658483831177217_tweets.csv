8,"one of the main reasons i invested heavily in luna was the anti-bear-market narrative, but luna still nuked heavily in may

the market only took that narrative into account late last year or even early this year. the market is still completely oblivious about $MAGIC &amp; its powers"
9,i think 4 $MAGIC is comparable to pre-5 $LUNA last year with a lot more upside potential.
10,"tip:

1. buy 1000 $MAGIC for $4k
2. lock it up for 12 months on Bridgeworld for a 400% boost
3. wake up in a year with half a million dollars
