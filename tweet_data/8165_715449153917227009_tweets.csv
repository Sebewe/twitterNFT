- It's a .eth Markdown blogging platform.
- Accounts are represented by NFTs (we call it WNFTs - Website NFTs).
- The look is wacky, with lots of procedurally generated art.
- The platform is democratic, will be owned &amp; governed by writers."

It's all part of the catholic belief. I'm liberal secular, but my best friends are religious (Muslims, Jews, Catholics). We get along great because tolerance goes both ways."
3,"@mixedground_xyz @ENS_DAO It's not an oligarch, the weights are not how many tokens voters have, but how many people let the delegates use their tokens to vote in their name.

This is politics of representation that the whole democratic world enjoys, not someone ""buying their way""."

It's not like Brantly let his faith get involved with ENS. We went 3 years of his activity without even being aware OF his faith (besides Twitter bio). It's others who dragged his religious views into the light."

52,"@countessofcoins WIP in the last stages.

But it's really an experiment meant to try a few concepts. 

One concept is how to build a decentralized blogging platform. 

But another is a .eth platform which is owned by its users (so the platform is managed like a DAO)."

What we build is a .eth blog platform where the platform itself is ENS+IPFS, and the posts are written in Markdown."
