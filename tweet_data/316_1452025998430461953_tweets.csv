71,@cozywyatt @3landersNFT No delayed launch/reveal which seems to be a big issue for other projects. I like how there’s lots of different dna types with unique dna subtypes. Kinda like clones
72,@AdamHustle 🤫🤐
73,@cozywyatt @3landersNFT Art is fantastic - all traits are well done and capture a range of detail. Team has consistently delivered on all fronts. Community is very strong too. I have a big bag /NFA
74,Haven’t sold any yet but these are at a floor price of 2.3 now and volume has been nonstop. Big conviction in pre-reveal loopy loops. Cozy 🧘 https://t.co/ewUUbYkcP4
