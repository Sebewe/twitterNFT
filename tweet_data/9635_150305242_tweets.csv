0,@NylaCollection @timepieces Amazing! Glad I discovered your mint and minted. Still holding my forever Nyla NFT.
1,@tmagled @ABigThingBadly @doodles It's insane for sniping. You have no chance without a similar product.
2,@tmagled @ABigThingBadly @doodles Just remember how quickly the entire space forgot about the Opensea phishing incident and still nobody knows what the F happened. They will move on lol.
3,@ABigThingBadly @tmagled @doodles Nftnerds set on doodles all day for a bunch of us I'm sure of that. Not many people in this space turn down free money. Why should you??
4,@SirWilliamEth Im having it spin and then auto close the popup to approve the listing in metmask
5,Anyone else having issues listing on 0pensea?
6,Did anyone ever get to the bottom of the 0pensea phishing incident? Seems like we all just forgot about it and moved on???

11,@DoNOTMint I'd just like to say I'm not an I.D.I.O.T. because I listened and didn't mint. I just bought on secondary😎
12,@8eight8_eth @LinusCaldwell5 @boredapebot Looks like nothing to work out as someone bought the listing at 22 to take the 70 ETH offer quickly. Someone bought it to take the money and runs. Sucks for sure.

18,@jwtvdrive @acrocalypseNFT I picked them up on secondary for well above mint price. Feel like alpha has to be earlier than than that and not already a 2x profit for minters.

36,Apparently they actually announced the time in discord... Website and twitter still said different. Jokers...
37,Love when projects open their mint before the time they say they will. Definitely doesn't SCREAM insider trading. @tubbycatsnft Also glad to see you had a terrible contract that had failed transactions losing 1 ETH🤪I guess I was lucky I couldn't even try to mint...

44,@NFTsAreNice @BoredApeYC We will see. I trust the process.
45,@SuperlativeSS Guess I'll vote as I had no idea about this limited window. 🤪
46,@NFTsAreNice @BoredApeYC Just minters doesn't make sense. If your going to reward holders it needs to be length of time held and then that continue as coin rewards for staking. What makes a minter better than the people who bought on secondary and made it into what it has become today?
47,@tmagled Great thread. I had a similar path getting 5 packs of the og coolcats nbatopshot packs when they dropped and the rest was history.

69,@ABigThingBadly @the_x2y2 Nope. False. Everyone needs to stop listing as your cutting into my free money.
70,@GIBBSGRANT @nftworldsNFT Super pullish
71,@Crohnie77 @Centrartz @KeepinItGutta And much better user experience on x2y2 than Looks. One reason I dont like supporting looks is also the fact they released a rushed project and promoted wash trading to make their seed investers/influencers stupid money with weth awards. Fuck giving cole and zeneca more money.
72,@nevermindwill @WeatheReportNFT Not again. 7 for me 🤣🤢🤮

81,@CmdrKJB @exlawyernft @Zeneca_33 Lol Im great. I just dont like seeing influencers fud their competition to their 200k followers.
82,@TaeKwonKrypto @Dabbing_dad_NFT @Nesotual @not_katarina All I've seen is fud and no facts to this.
83,@exlawyernft @Zeneca_33 He dragged x2y2 into this without any evidence. He is a seed investor in Looks and shouldn't say anything without being 100% when it moves those markets. Look at the charts and time of tweets. This was market manipulation whether he meant to or not as looks went up and x2y2 down.
84,@Zeneca_33 Someone with your following shouldn't be spreading rumors without facts. You have to know that you move markets with a tweet and imho it is even worse as you have a significant stake in their competition.
85,@0x_fxnction Pulling down your pants in front of 15 people is a felony bro.
86,@Zeneca_33 Why dont you mention Looks? Is it because your an investor? You need to be better Zeneca! 200k people follow your every word. People think its opensea/x2y2 because people like YOU said so. Leaving out Looks is a bad Look!!!
87,@DiscoverXnft I enjoyed your feed when you made great threads and didnt just pump your bags to your new followers. Be better bro.
88,@Zeneca_33 Keep pumping your Looks investment and fudding the competition of @the_x2y2. Great look zeneca. Thought you were better that this in this space but you will say stuff like this with 0 evidence knowing your following will listen.
89,@sxtvik @ABigThingBadly @Zeneca_33 is pumping his bag. He was a seed invester in Looks. Such an asshat move.
90,Conrats $Looks bag shillers on Fudding @the_x2y2 to pump your bags. Good look. https://t.co/mbuRmiQ6rR
91,@pauliod What evidence yo you have on X2Y2 being involved in any way?
92,@ABigThingBadly @0xQuit @EcsZed 100% any evidence they are involved or just fud?
93,@DiscoverXnft Fud factory on x2y2. Looks like its Opensea.
94,@Knuckl3z__ @Stoniphantom Do you accept ETH?

97,@QualityNames_ @OGDfarmer @MetaMask @Trezor @opensea @LooksRareNFT @DecentralGames Would you rather them wait to push it so more people could lose their NFTs to old listings or release it and join the gang in telling metamask to get with it.
98,@the_x2y2 If you all could stop listing qualified NFTs I'd appreciate it. You are lowering my daily free ETH and that is not fair.
99,@GratefulApe_eth @LooksRareNFT The best move I made this year was switching to a Ledger from a Trezor. 😂
