6,"i say to go pump the others that are not affiliated with @Pixelmon simply because (1.) we dont want to give pixelmon royalites, (2.) no matter what... you cannot stop degen shit! &amp; i dont think we should stop degens, its fun to see! so imo, if you degen, go degen elsewhere!

fin"
7,"Okay DaGoat, then what is your solution?? I still want to meme and have fun doing degen shit with my friends! 
its simple, go support/gamble/meme/toss-around/pump/dump any other kevin related meme nft's/collections &amp; give those ppl your money. not the mfers who royally f'd up

👇"
8,"that is entirely on us for allowing it to slide right now.
the way i see it, we are disguising their fuck up for them. they sit back and earn from something a REAL irl business who take a HUGE hit from. (ie; if WoW or Halo did some shit like this--they're fucked)

👇"
9,"That's not a good look imo. For the space in general.
It sets the bar for others thinking they can overpromise and underdeliver and people will just make memes out of it and enjoy it. If the next couple of weeks/months are projects overpromising and then revealing some💩then

👇"
10,"I am ALL for the gambling, the memes, the degen shit! However, I don't think we should be allowing a project that entirely overpromised and underdelivered earn royalties...
At this point, by us pumping kevin pixelmon nft's, we are paying them for fucking people over...

👇"
11,"i get it, kevin is dope af! the gambling/memes are all fun af. but we should be looking at the macro here...
@Pixelmon fucked all of us over, especially their holders (besides kevin holders now). 
Everytime a kevin is traded, @Pixelmon is earning royalties.
