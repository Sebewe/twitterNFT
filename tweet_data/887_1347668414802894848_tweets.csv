1,I'm at a loss for words for what's happening in Ukraine. Thinking of every single one of you affected ❤️
2,@svvrth Still staking my friend. Broken Sea is running out of lives
3,@Apesy_ @BoredApeYC Haha I’m taking mine to Costa Rica tomorrow!
4,@MoneyMontini @doodles Doodler here!
5,@LeTopshot Depends what you want to do. If you don’t delist then your listings will remain active (until they expire - depending on how long you list them for). When I listed mine I set to 1 day and then revoked permissions. Hope that helps
6,@shovelNFT Yeah you have to list. If you go to your items page on the site and click ‘bulk list’ it will tell you how many you have to list before you can claim 👌
7,@NeonApesYC Happy birthday! Every year gets better and better :)
8,"For those claiming the #x2y2 airdrop make sure to revoke your permissions afterwards to be extra safe and protect your #NFTs
