90,"Please hire a consultant who is at the very least familiar with the NFT space. If you need help, feel free to reach out.

5) Your second ""Anti-bot"" raffles is just as bad. People who joined ON THE DOT were not able to submit their addresses. (4/10)"
97,"2) When pills were holding at a floor price well above 0.4ETH, you released sales of an overwhelming amount of pills at 0.24ETH, undercutting the FP of your loyal holders.

3) The revv car airdrop for early pill-consumers that you mentioned had no further updates. (3/10)"
98,"When you set up expectations, these expectations NEED to be met. You claim to reward loyal holders. But here's what's up:

1) You changed pills conversion from 4:1 to 3:1, hurting loyal fans who joined in early. (2/10)"
