18,@punk9059 I dont get why they would go through an auction house (other than sudden liquidity) when LL has 0% fees. Maybe he does value sudden liquidity as you said

29,@ricgalbraith @osf_nft @Sothebys I dont think it sells for the minimum bid
30,"@ricgalbraith @osf_nft @Sothebys There isnt a $14m bid, thats the minimum i believe"
31,"@greatmando_nft @BoredApe1000 @KeyboardMonkey3 I agree with alot of what he said in that thread, but traders tend to sway to the extreme (bullish or bearish) and KBM is the king of being extreme. I still think people should sell their $300k jpeg if they cant pay for their $30 lunch"
