https://t.co/8X3euWACvw"
16,"By creating a one stop shop for users to influence many protocols, on top of the ones they are invested in themselves, @retrogrademoney allows for more efficient, scalable, and educated chain-wide governance."
17,"Retrograde is to Terra ecosystem governance what @ConvexFinance is to @CurveFinance yield, allowing users to ""boost"" their governance to a larger scale. Here they are utilizing a ve mechanism in a proposal for @anchor_protocol:
https://t.co/mjaf3McaN8"
18,"With such a promising, scalable ecosystem, proper governance is vital to success, and thus proper incentives as well. @retrogrademoney hopes to create incentives for governance across the entire Terra ecosystem."
19,"The @terra_money ecosystem is growing rapidly, recently surpassing BSC with $16 billion in TVL,  putting it second only to Ethereum. Those who believe in crypto as a valid form of currency should believe in $UST as the one to prevail."
20,"As ecosystems evolve and grow in depth and breadth, the importance of governance will grow in tandem. Likewise, in order for protocols to function with efficiency and sustainability, we will need efficient and sustainable governance."
21,"The majority of volume around governance tokens is simply short term speculation on the token price, rather than vested interest in the long term success of the protocol as a whole."
22,"More on this:
https://t.co/Kz1CKNvce8"
23,"Very few protocols incentivize their governance token holders to hold long term and utilize their voting rights. The vote escrow model, pioneered by @CurveFinance and more recently iterated upon with the @solidlyexchange ve(3,3) model, is a step in the right direction."
24,"The topic today is governance.

Let's be honest, how many of us actively participate in the governance of protocols whose governance tokens we hold? It's okay, it's not your fault. Read this tweet from @retrogrademoney, discussing voter apathy on Terra:
https://t.co/ZOOjUa6v4x"
25,"There are many slippery slopes within the world of crypto startups. Often times, protocols make trade-offs that might induce hype and pumpage in the short run, but inevitably lead to a negative feedback loop of despair when speculation devoid of any conviction goes away.

33,"To see some of the specific data primitives used by Passport for LoyaltyScore and any custom iterations protocols may need, check out the docs:
https://t.co/KqDt2Jr8sf"
34,"That is by no means to say they should bar users with poor LoyaltyScores from using their protocols. That would be going against everything crypto stands for. Rather, LoyaltyScore can be used in a game theoretic way to incentivize users to act in the best interest of all parties."
35,"🔮A quick analogy to wrap up:

I like to think of LoyaltyScore as a credit score. In the same way that banks are more likely to give out loans to clients with good credit history, DeFi protocols should look at their users in the same way."
36,"They could then give those users incentives that are even further tailored to them, by giving staking/trading rewards based on their LoyaltyScore."
37,"This is exactly what @Passport_Labs would allow them to do. By utilizing Passport's LoyaltyScore metric, X2Y2 could hand pick the wallets who demonstrate a conviction to the LooksRare project, and who will be likely to show conviction towards another new project."
38,"@the_x2y2 is a new NFT marketplace following a similar strategy to that of LooksRare, with a few modifications. But what if instead of simply mass airdropping to OpenSea users, X2Y2 could have looked at the LooksRare users who are still trading and staking after the decrease?"
39,"As expected, the decrease in trading rewards and yield lead to a huge decrease in volume. While the future success of LooksRare is yet to be known, it is a good indication of the drastic short term effects this strategy can have. https://t.co/GVDDK96pbK"
40,"...LooksRare saw incredible volume in its initial weeks after launch.  Naturally, that yield has since declined, and is now sitting at around 200%. The $LOOKS token, which saw an ath of $7, is now trading at around $2."
41,"@LooksRareNFT and @the_x2y2 

LooksRare performed one of the most prevalent vampire attacks in recent crypto history, airdropping the native $LOOKS token to users based on their @opensea volume. With an initial staking APR of around 900% along with high trading rewards..."
42,Let's take a look at a scenario where Passport could help in finding those hodlers🔮
43,"The key is figuring out how to create an incentive model that doesn't sacrifice long term sustainability for short term growth. Typically, this means incentivizing the right kind of user. Not the yield farmer, but rather the loyal hodler who is invested in the protocol's success."
44,"More on this issue:
https://t.co/kOI3wdjWzy"
45,"In the case of one sided staking models for attracting users, in a similar way, protocols are often pressured to reach deep into their native token reserves to pay out a higher APR than their competition. As the rewards dry up, users no longer feel incentivized."
46,"In the case of DEXs, where LP's are required for pool 2s, gung-ho yield farmers quickly hop on these opportunities and soak up most of the rewards, ultimately removing any incentive for other LPs, and simultaneously creating sell pressure for the native token."
47,"New protocols inevitably face a common dilemma in attracting new users to their platform and building liquidity for their native token. We often see absurd APY offerings to LPs and stakers in attempts to jumpstart liquidity off the bat. 

The typical story ends up like this:"
48,"So, why is this awesome?
Read on.🔮"
49,Passport Protocol is an open analytics platform that allows projects to take advantage of fully composable data primitives to gain insight into user activity. This opens up incredible opportunities for creating smarter incentive models that benefit the protocol in the long run.

60,"@akaJustCrypto I have not staked myself, and I see on the app that it says 10% when you click on staking. @jvhak mentioned a fixed 30% in the AMA, which will change soon, but I'm not sure where that is."
61,"15/^cont.
Overall, I think Curated has potential to be a significant player. I am excited to see what they can do with the desktop marketplace, which I think will garner more attention from experienced users who would rather the decentralized option."
62,"14/^cont.
After trying out the app, I am pretty impressed with the UI and setup. Minting NFTs is straightforward. When importing from a wallet, a gas fee is required for whatever chain you are coming from, but after that there is indeed no gas."
63,"13/^cont.
... platforms are still very daunting for beginners. I do hope that there will a more fluid experience between both decentralized and centralized platforms in the future, but for now, it is solutions like @curateproject that will bring new people into this space."
64,"12/ My thoughts:
Like I've said before, I value user experience over almost everything. While the narrative around decentralization is strong, centralized platforms still hold their place and will for the foreseeable future. The simple fact is, most decentralized ..."
65,"11/ What security measures are being used?
As a centralized exchange, there are many layers of protection such as AWS and Cloudflare, and they have successfully defended DDoS attacks. Centralization also brings regulation and necessary accountability."
66,"10/ @jvhak, Curate CEO background:
Full-stack web 2.0 dev, wanted to build a solution for buying goods all in one place with crypto, then added NFTs as they gained popularity"
67,"9/ Limitations that can be improved?
Focusing on optimizing the desktop app which will allow for a non-custodial option as well (Decentralized).
Currently aimed at NFT newbies, they hope to cater to experienced traders as well."
68,"8/ How can they offer 0 gas fees?
Curate is a centralized platform, so they utilize a custodial wallet, which users can import NFTs to from Eth or Sol. There are then no gas fees related to txns on the app, as it is not operating on a separate chain."
69,"7/ Other features of app:
Two-step minting of 1of1s for free on native chain, 50% off on ETH.
Supported tokens for buying/selling: $XCUR, $SOS, $USDC, $ETH, $DOT, $THETA, $SOL, $ALGO
Ability to buy nfts on multiple chains with different tokens.
(eg use SOS to buy solana NFT)"
70,"6/ Advantages of mobile based marketplace:
Fully functional (minting, staking, fiat conversion) as opposed to others like OpenSea.
Internet usage is 60% mobile and increasing, especially within the creator economy"
71,"5/ Will Curate be able to sustain current rewards long term?
Emphasis on not trying to overpromise and underdeliver.
While providing the optimal user experience, Curate looks to provide the best possible rewards. Rewards are reasonable and will increase with increased volume."
72,"4/ ^cont.
The base fee is 4%, but it decreases with the number of XCUR staked, reaching 05 with 25,000 tokens staked. Governance rights will be given to XCUR holders as well. Also, $SOS stakers will have governance rights as well."
73,"3/ How to stake / uses for $XCUR ?
Staking can be done through the app, with a 30% yield atm which will change to a tiered model as shown below some time in Q2. $XCUR is the native token which all items priced in. There is a favorable commission fee for trading with XCUR, https://t.co/w3IBFOl73y"
74,"2/ About Curate:
Curate is a mobile NFT marketplace, offering gasless txns and multi-chain functionality. They are approaching 100,000 users, and they have a marketplace for both NFTs and physical goods. https://t.co/XTwWZJiNVx"

In the end, I think the question is how much regular people really care about decentralization. It may happen that the trilemma is all but solved by the time those people are all here, but in the meantime, I am bullish on user experience."
79,"3/
The current pathway (Coinbase -&gt; Metamask -&gt; ETH dapps, many fees along the way), is slow and complicated for a beginner. Chains like @terra_money, whose apps shorten that pathway and make it easier for new people to enter DeFi and Web 3.0, will be most appealing."
80,"2/
If the majority of crypto skeptics are to ever adopt it, they will be inclined to use products that are familiar to them, ones that resemble the tradfi products they use already."
81,"1/
As I use alternative chains like @terra_money, @avalancheavax, and @solana more, it only amplifies the frustration with ETH gas fees. While I believe ETH will hold its place long term, I also believe people will naturally gravitate towards the easiest and cheapest option."

4. If you believe in @LooksRareNFT as a true competitor in the space (without wash trading), then you can have faith that WETH apr will stay strong long term."
96,"3/
3. It is important to note that trading rewards will be decreased as well, likely leading to less wash trading and lower WETH apr. However, the same affect could occur with these, as less people are trading, those still trading receive a bigger portion."
97,"2/
2. If we see a massive unstaking and selloff, not only will we see a dip in $LOOKS price (opportunity to buy more), but also less stakers meaning the remaining stakers get a bigger portion of the rewards. Stake those new $LOOKS you bought and you have an even bigger portion."
98,"1/
Those staking $LOOKS atm, if you're feeling any fud from the yield decrease coming up, consider a few things:

1. The total yield may not decrease as much as you may think. At time of writing, LOOKS apr = 226%, while WETH apr = 361%. LOOKS apr will decrease by just over 50%"
