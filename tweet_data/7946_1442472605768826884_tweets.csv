8,@chibiapegang @farokh @CryptoMories @opensea Your take is as bad as your take on the Ukraine war where you argued that U.S. would've invaded Mexico if it allied with Russia and China.
9,@chibiapegang @farokh @CryptoMories @opensea And you believe the artist instead of mories? How do you know which one is telling the truth and which one is lying?
10,@chibiapegang @farokh @CryptoMories @opensea there's an allegation that the artist you are defending copied the idea from another artist.

20,@TheShamdoo Really? Woah. I also thought he was in his late 50s or early 60s. Must have been playing the NFT game earlier than everyone. Playing the game will age you that much.

22,@n3aR93 @MychalSimka @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea I think something else will go to 0.02 earlier.
23,"@benoitbrouilla2 @BoredApeYC Love your clean M2, my fren."
24,"@NelsonAdcock @MychalSimka @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea Light speed compared to opensea, yes. I mean were you so spoiled before that your standards suddenly went so high? Are you a coder by any chance and you know how easy it is to implement something like this without messing up everything?"
25,"@Fractal_Visions @MERKZY_YT @Chefff69 @BixbiteOfficial @MychalSimka @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea Guys, you can already place a bet by buying or selling the tokens you are placing your bet on."
26,@OogaWanKanobi @MychalSimka @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea We definitely need a healthy competition and not the unhealthy environment we found ourselves in under opensea's monopoly.
27,"@OogaWanKanobi @MychalSimka @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea You must have missed it when I said x2y2 has an edge on two things, which is the UI and reward. Looks is ahead on other things, like hiding WETH offers, showing floor price of traits, and many others. Both will not stand in place."
28,"@MychalSimka @Fractal_Visions @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea High APR won't last long. Once it stabilizes, we'll all see the real market value of x2y2 and the market will now decide which one is better based on what each protocol can deliver. If x2y2 innovates as fast as looks, then it will be good for everyone."
29,@Fractal_Visions @MychalSimka @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea I'm not a big trader and I'm getting plenty just staking the $LOOKS I got from the airdrop.
30,"@MychalSimka @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea It was a problem that was fixed because the community requested it. Did you see the latest innovation now where if you click an NFT you can see the floor price of each individual trait? It doesn't have to be a zero-sum game. You can bet on both, you know."
31,"@Fractal_Visions @MychalSimka @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea I have the same reaction with $LOOKS. It doesn't have to be a zero sum game, sers. We can have both looks and x2y2 functioning well for the community. If they both innovate fast, then we will be winners and opensea will be the loser."
32,"@MychalSimka @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea Can you do it now? Did you count the number of innovations made since the start? Did you see opensea hiding invalid WETH offers? Is that something you can do in x2y2? Lightspeed relative to opensea, definitely yes. Can x2y2 keep up?"
33,"@MychalSimka @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea @LooksRareNFT innovates at the speed of light. @the_x2y2  only has an edge on UI and the listing rewards right now, but I heard from the grapevine that looks is updating its UI, and the listing rewards can easily be copied. Can x2y2 innovate as fast as looks? We'll see."

40,@itstylersays @CozomoMedici He’d get canceled too if he sent a portion of the eth to artchick.
41,@itstylersays Only reason why I buy BTC is because I always spend my ETH.
42,@khateva Agree. I think we should fork a new series after season 5 or when the series overtook the books.
43,"@itsdanataylor And no SimpDAO, please. I blocked everyone else who did a version of a SimpDAO."

45,@painter_crypto You spelled Spider-Man wrong though.
46,@MRMILLI0NAIRE @NFTSasha exactly.
47,@Nate_Rivers Looks like someone will buy the dip
48,@Reaper_NFT @CRYPTOALBATROSS @ShrewdCharlie @pixelvault_ @look_labs @punkscomic Yeah. Hard to keep up. I’m constantly trimming the discord servers I join.
49,"@jbondwagon @CRYPTOALBATROSS @pixelvault_ @look_labs @punkscomic Yes. PVFDAO now basically free for you. I wish I had gotten the cool pets whitelist though, lol."
50,"@jbondwagon @CRYPTOALBATROSS @pixelvault_ @look_labs @punkscomic I think you already got your acquisition cost back, JBond, or almost there? Just the antonym and cool pets allowlist is already close."
51,"@JunicsETH yes, I can see how it is extremely painful for you now. Can only hope that the team continues to innovate and we get more people using the platform in the short to midterm, then might see a reversal."
52,"@JunicsETH I haven’t sold yet, although my cost is 0 (from airdrop).  I’m still hodling because the team innovates at the speed of light."
53,"@CRYPTOALBATROSS @ShrewdCharlie @pixelvault_ @look_labs @punkscomic Yeah, the whitelist was a big miss for me. I read it but didn’t think much of it. Will be getting Courtney’s origin story though for sure. PVFDAO token from the alpha, rewards, etc., had already more than paid its acquisition value for me."
