32,"Update: 
@look_labs is sold out before public mint. The collection is trending on OS.

Minted 3 greenpasses, bought 9 + 1 OG.

Let’s see where this leads us. Farming Wool &amp; Weed in 2022 will surely be a lot of fun. 🌱 https://t.co/vESgFgQToL"

36,"The OG pass will probably moon really hard too, only 321 available, in-game advantages &amp; less than 15 listed right now."
37,"About @look_labs , a P2E weed-themed game:
- If you own an animal on Wolf Game or a PVFD from @pixelvault_ , you can mint a Green Pass
- Public mint later today
- Promising game design &amp; mechanics https://t.co/AlEuOyTRPy

I minted 3 GP, bought 2 off secondary &amp; 1 O.G Pass

DYOR😏 https://t.co/clXROJ9abE"
38,"@brydisanto @look_labs And honestly, we need your spreadsheets on this project my friend 😌"
39,"@brydisanto @look_labs Exactly, This was a trusted enough team to be on GM capital, with a good game design principle and not even at public mint yet. I don’t see how this could not be a win if you mint some stuff. 🤔"
40,"@davidbankless @withoutnameNFT @basilmountian @look_labs @wolfdotgame Honestly I wouldn’t recommend the project blindly to anyone, I like the breeding/shop mechanism and i’m in for the gameplay, the $high price could be terrible but I doubt you would lose money if you mint it."
41,@withoutnameNFT @basilmountian @look_labs @wolfdotgame Yeah I was wondering about that too. I guess not everyone will want to mint 3 more.
42,"@basilmountian @look_labs @wolfdotgame Same here, really bullish, love the game design. I might scoop a loooot of assets 👀"
43,@RedBeardAPI @look_labs My bad it opens at 4:20pm for Greenlists.
44,@look_labs Minting doesn’t seem to work for me.
45,@thefrenchie_eth 🔥🙌🏼
46,"Not biting but « botting », funny typo though."
47,"If this doesn’t make you bullish I don’t what will. Wolf Game is leading the p2e pack, they cant even tease anything without risks of biting, exploit or copy cats yet the ecosystem is really solid.

This is an anti hype project holding strong, ironically you should be hyped. https://t.co/VhcWoErNzV"

70,@davidbankless @wolfdotgame Definitely* I was too excited.
71,@davidbankless @wolfdotgame Definetely looking forward to it haha
72,"I was feeling woolish this morning and did a thing.

The @wolfdotgame farm is now 40 farmers strong. 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 https://t.co/GcDAkdvdHP"
73,@CryptoTxn @catandmousenft More info here 👇🏼 https://t.co/X9I55DcSfk
74,"@CryptoTxn @catandmousenft If your looking for short term value, farmers for sure. If you’re looking to play the game I would buy them as pairs."
75,"@davidbankless Oh yeah just noticed your answer! I guess we’ll see, but to be honest I’m pretty confident."
76,@CryptoTxn @catandmousenft Thanks! I’ve been preaching this a lot but they are some affordable entry points right now with land and farmers. Would be happy to have you in the community 🙌🏼
77,@davidbankless That the game will never appeal to more players than they are right now. I doubt it but that would be a downer and probably bad for the overall ecosystem.
78,"So, just by playing Wolf Game early, pouches are paying me a very nice income while the token is historically low and has virtually no utility yet. Imagine when the full game launches.

There are some very nice pouches to win by engaging in the Alpha game right now, go for it 🐺 https://t.co/X4FHE7XUZz"
79,@Deanik_k @BoredApeYC Super bowl for sure 😏
80,"@justKAWSthat1 Just came back from a 10 day ski trip, feels so good after 2 years of lockdown.

Enjoy ❄️❄️❄️"
81,"@GirlWhoShivers Wonderful, congrats 👏🏻"
82,"@ka_dewaal @davidbankless @wolfdotgame Not for now yeah, but a game executed by a great team is coming eventually."
83,@davidbankless @wolfdotgame Sounds like an awesome plan. Nothing wrong with taking profits 🙌🏼
84,"@davidbankless @wolfdotgame Don’t get me wrong, I’m hoarding pouches too. Can’t wait for $wool to reach $1+ 💰"
85,@davidbankless @wolfdotgame I think pouches will drastically lower in price at the end of Alpha Game. They are incredibly valuable still.

90,@ronthefarmer @wolfdotgame I really want a zombie/demon/skeleton farmer 😏
91,"We love the farmers 👨‍🌾🧑‍🌾🌾

If you don’t trust me ask @brydisanto https://t.co/O7bQ1CHTfH"
92,All of this makes them the most interesting asset to purchase right now. And they’re sub 1 eth so it could even be the best point of entry in the ecosystem right now with almost all the other assets being staked.
93,"Lastly, the Shep teased a reveal recently and historically, when Shep speaks, things happen pretty quickly. The Wool event #1 is over so it might me a matter of hours (days) before we have some meaningful information about farmers. https://t.co/9vd83yVDdu"
94,"I believe it is confirmed they will be randomly generated, their traits might impact their efficiency ingame but it will for sure impact their coolness. Imagine a demon farmer burning other people’s crops. (this is pure speculation)"
95,"Since they will boost land production, they will be mandatory for anyone willing to play the game in an optimal way BUT there are only 11k farmers for 20k lands."
96,"Did you know? Farmers are one of the scarcest assets in @wolfdotgame seconding Alpha 8 wolves, with only 0.92% of the supply listed.

Small thread 👇🏼 https://t.co/7jBlt1Vfeq"
97,Web2 / Web3 trend really shows how more relatable we all are behind a PFP NFT of the same collection. So many different people on the pictures yet we’re all the same tribe. ✨
98,@the_good_knight @TerminatusX @brydisanto I’m proud 👏🏻👏🏻
99,@wolfinplainview And… Shep didn’t even tweet 😅
