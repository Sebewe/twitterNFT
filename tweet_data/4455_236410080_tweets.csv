Conclusion.
👉For collectors: DO YOUR OWN FUCKING RESEARCH!

👉For creators: spend more on quality devs.

👉For devs: make sure to safeguard your metadata to avoid such leaks."
93,"10/11
Now the final juicy part. The same dev has been working hard on a contract for Chaotic DJs, which looks a lot like many recent ""3D animals"" projects.

I'm not gonna make any assumptions here, but you may want to watch out. https://t.co/3FljLfaQoy"
94,"9/11
Now let's recall Gooniez pre-mint announcement about theit contract.

Which hasn't aged well.

And was also a copy-pasta from somewhere else.

And also was a complete BS because Gooniez contract is a simple ERC721.

It's still impressive for 20 days of solidity dev experice! https://t.co/1ZWrAKvI31"
95,"8/11
A couple clicks away is another address that's been creating and testing contracts including the draft Gooniez contract.

Here we can notice that the first contract was created about 20 days ago and it was a Hashlips template for beginners. We have a serious pro here!😅 https://t.co/QOSH3DHBjF"
96,"7/11
Let's track Gooniez the contract creator and see what we find! 

Gooniez creation:
https://t.co/fOkO8A3Jxg

Same address on Rinkeby testnet hasn't created contracts, but has been testng a lot:

97,"6/11
 However, several hours ago the team responed to the metadata leaking and announced that the metadata will be reshuffled before the reveal, so there's no point in trying to snipe rares with the method above. Props to them!

But let me give you some more juicy details 🔥👇 https://t.co/I8r5RkBLN9"
98,"5/11
With this knowledge we can now visit OpenSea and try to snipe the rares, which is of course an unethical thing to do and I do not encourage such behavior. 

Look, one of the rarest ducks already has an offer well above floor, so I wasn't the first to do this :P https://t.co/O608jl8jAs"

With a data processing tool preference (I used DataFileConverter), we merge these JSON files into a single Excel file and do a very simple rarity analysis. 

Look, now we know where all the rares are! https://t.co/AXLvCRlyVI"
