2,@ryanhammertime @FireFlyFlips_ I got no autos and no numbered as well.  I got a couple of Lamelo national pride but base.  Was overall very underwhelming.
3,@welovetheart @alphagirlclub @SuperlativeSS @creatureNFT @DentedFeelsNFT @BoredApeYC @BoonjiProject @iwwon_official @AdamBombSquad @ToyBoogers there’s something about the @alphagirlclub art that just draws me in. It’s intoxicating. Probably the only NFT that made me say “I gotta get one of those” right when I saw it. Mad I only minted 1.

38,@TomWade @Courtyard_NFT @0xtanaka You own the NFT which is a digital representation of the card and can burn it for the real product at any time (I think)
39,"@Madge_80 @0xtanaka @Courtyard_NFT Has not been determined yet but you have to understand the project to understand the mint price.  If they spend $1,000,000 on 1000 cards then the mint price would be around $1000 (price of the average card)."
40,@0xtanaka @Courtyard_NFT This is a different type of project. Correct me if I’m wrong but the value of your NFT is kinda tied to the value of the actual card you get. So the mint price will be around the average price of all of the cards they purchased.
