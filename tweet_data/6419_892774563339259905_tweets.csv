2,"I’m not super religious, but I was raised Catholic and paid attention in school. I’m pretty sure God would tell these folks that this isn’t it. He’d tell them it shouldn’t be for him. He’d tell them it should be for the care and love of their neighbors. 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/ZsfexI2tGh"
3,"@Truth_Comes_1st @WendyRogersAZ Accurate, except this bully has made no such promise."
4,"@Toffifay76 @flexghost1 Haha, this is gold. I’ve noticed their crying about oppression has subsided now that there’s a real orange they’d have to compare their apple to. Their little tantrum and subsequent arrests seem like child’s play now that 6000+ Russians have been arrested for literally nothing."

 ""The hardest eviction to win""... seems like they can go heck themselves. lmao

21,"@JordanUhl @kenklippenstein This is a very typical investment strategy in tradfi. Hedging private sector stocks with defense stocks is a part of well balanced portfolios. Very f*cked, but another day at the office for Wall St."
22,"@BitBoyJay Also... if your landlord wants to evict you, that is a court proceeding. Contrary to their sh*t letter, the burden of proof would be on them to prove you had violated your lease terms. Slum lord if I've ever heard of one. Do they honestly think google doesn't exist?"
23,@AbdoEleish @suhpremecrypto @BitBoyJay 😂
24,"@BitBoyJay Invite your landlord to come sit in your house for the net 48 hrs. This seems the only way, and they will refuse obv. Then you have a civil law leg to stand on. If I were you, I would have an attorney reply to them quite frankly."
25,"Over the next week or so, I’m going to magnetize scam “support” accounts by tweeting about various apps and exchanges. Let’s see how many 🗑 accounts I can report in one week. 🙂"
26,@LloydsPseudonym @BigSarg75945517 @Pepper_203 @BTCGandalf How will it personally damage us?
27,"@TheBeatOfPower @JensenCK1 @1world_steward @CaldronPool Nah, it’s that you repeat your insults like a simp bot. Either way, you don’t make any of the compelling arguments you think you do. Have a nice life. Try not to hate all of it."
28,"@TheBeatOfPower @JensenCK1 @1world_steward @CaldronPool Yeah, def feeling like some canned bot responses here. https://t.co/DnCshhsuyX"
29,@TheBeatOfPower @JensenCK1 @1world_steward @CaldronPool Kinda feels like you’re the bot here… https://t.co/7kHuKtd7aA
30,@bpatter49 @br0k3nhalos @RealCandaceO Oh nice! I assume in the desert mostly? Or is it at sea?
31,@1world_steward @TheBeatOfPower @CaldronPool Go back and watch the entire video. It’s linked above in the thread. It’s an editorial about older and serious patients taking the more exp. drugs. It never says she’s taking them.
32,@therourke @CaldronPool Lest all these commenters forget… this is A Current Affair after all. Lol
33,@br0k3nhalos @RealCandaceO Yeah no. We def don’t do that hahaha
34,"@br0k3nhalos @RealCandaceO Ohhhh wasn’t even addressing that part, but if I had to mention it, I would probs say the SAC is constantly doing training. I see B2s from Whiteman AFB flying formation all the time in central MO."
35,@br0k3nhalos @RealCandaceO Whatcha mean? The spending total is easily found… the upgrade part was a joke regarding the ridiculous amount of said spending.
36,"@br0k3nhalos @RealCandaceO Hahaha, US racks up $767bn a year in defense spending. I’m pretty sure they have been upgrading them. 🚀"
37,"@KalKent1938 @mat_singleton @RealCandaceO Wow, your sentiment went way over these folks’ heads. Unsurprising."

39,"@DvlsAdvokate @westsidebets @BTCGandalf I personally feel there is a real risk of authoritarianism in America right now, but it isn’t going to come from politicians issuing mask mandates. It will come from those who take power under the guise of freedom fighters. It always does."
40,"@DvlsAdvokate @westsidebets @BTCGandalf I agree that the force used is unnecessary, but that is a police culture problem in North America. Not a sign of governmental tyranny. That was my point. I fully understand the optics and how it can feel similar tho."
41,"@westsidebets @DvlsAdvokate @BTCGandalf Have you or anyone you know in either Canada or America have to use the term, Death Squads in relation to their families? I very much doubt it."
42,@westsidebets @DvlsAdvokate @BTCGandalf If this is what they went through then we were grossly misinformed about the atrocities committed down there. This is an asshole getting roughed up for likely attacking the cops. Not the same as his experience at all.
43,@LloydsPseudonym @BigSarg75945517 @Pepper_203 @BTCGandalf How?
44,@Escobadr @LloydsPseudonym @Pepper_203 @BTCGandalf lmaooooooo that's what you took away from this? I said this ISN'T oppresion. Plain and simple.
45,"@DvlsAdvokate @BTCGandalf In the protests I've attended, we got about 5 seconds of disburse warnings before we were shot at with tear gas and rubber bullets. These guys got days. Sorry, not sorry."
46,"@DvlsAdvokate @BTCGandalf These people have been afforded every opportunity to make the decision to walk away after weeks of protests. They chose not to, and just like every other human alive... they now face consequences for their actions."
47,"@DvlsAdvokate @BTCGandalf We have been watching police do this to minorities in the US for centuries with no cap. This guy caught a couple knees (likely for heavy resisting arrest and attacking these cops). I have zero sympathy for these folks. As for you and your family, I have loads of sympathy for that"
48,@LloydsPseudonym @Pepper_203 @BTCGandalf The fact that you see this as tyranny makes it pretty plain that you are in no way qualified to speak about real oppression.
49,@Jogador20131 @BTCGandalf Been three weeks. Pretty sure people in NYC still have supplies.

78,@EagleCreekHoss @joncoopertweets Civil trial is very different than a criminal trial.
79,"@BillWylie3rd @BetsyJFordIsaac @joncoopertweets Very true, but not before they levy 8-9 figures of fines against him."
80,@sm_helsing @joncoopertweets Real tough to take the fifth in a civil proceeding. Most of the time it is inferred as an admission of liability. Civil trial law is much different than criminal.
81,@BillWylie3rd @BetsyJFordIsaac @joncoopertweets Taking the 5th in a civil trial is an admission of liability. It would be over for him at that point. Same thing will happen if he refuses to show up.
82,"@dylanized @MMCrypto @coaster89 Hahaha fasho. I see what he’s trying to say tho, but don’t agree overall with the message. Comments like these only serve to pique the interest of politicians."
