1,"Maybe @garyvee will come shill some community love their way when they all go to prison. The IRS now has an OpenSea / Gary Vee team to review their new found wealth. Seems Mark Cuban is already trying to make a deal to avoid prison, who will he rat out this time to save his skin?"
2,Decentralized systems support crooks not a community. These dirt bags made so much money off failed transactions if the right lawyer got a hold of their data could class action them back to normal income status. I hope they go to jail soon.
3,"Congratulations you crooks! 

“OpenSea, cofounders Devin Finzer and Alex Atallah are each worth about $2.2 billion” 

They needed $1B each instead of a dev team to fix their numerous problems. While users lost more than $1B a month &amp; no help desk🖕 https://t.co/5efcWBphKO"
4,@nozeytron But everyone has this decentralized thing figured out 🤷‍♂️
5,Where is @garyvee with his kumbai feels wrapped in shills? Lol maybe his good vibe will bail you out of jail not like his $90M he made releasing his cartoons is going to a bail out program.
6,NFT have stalled… sus AF that the pyramid scheme is collapsing and the sensible use of the utility of NFT will go with it. I blame the “greedy maxi” supported by inside trader Mark Cuban. Or was it Mark’s friend Ghislaine Maxwell who owns 20% of all ripple? Good luck crooks
7,I’ve known @j1mmyeth 20 years IRL and when his followers were @ 3k and you still wouldn’t follow me on Twitter all this time. Anyone I tell that story must make the conclusion of how big of douches these maxi “OG” are lol. The IRS is a great equalizer.
8,I said decentralized wasn’t decentralized 6 months ago… people like @j1mmyeth promoting pfp projects seems sus and centralized not just a shill. Any whale can jump on the anon account and drive the price. https://t.co/OZIe9E5wed
