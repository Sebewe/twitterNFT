11,"If Kepa doesn't win it: ""Should've kept Mendy. The disrespect.""

If Mendy doesn't win it: ""We had Kepa on the bench for these moments!"" 

Endless argument with no right answer. 

Either way: the outfield players should've easily ended it before pens. https://t.co/5tjY3IZUJw"
12,Chelsea fans seeing what United fans went through with DDG vs Henderson last summer 😂
13,@CFCKonrad Pulisic at least forced save. Bro I could've finished Mount's chances 😂
14,@LampsFIFA Now you see what United fans went through last summer 😂
15,"RT @ChuBoi: When Pulisic misses those: ""He's shit""

When an English player misses: ""So unlucky there"" 

😂"
16,@RossCam1999 If Mount makes those then refereeing doesn't change anything. At least Pulisic hit the target.

19,"If Mount scores two easy chance then no need for pens. 

If Lukaku, Werner, or Havertz missed those... 🤐 https://t.co/qgv9Kf1FxY"
20,They'll blame Kepa but Mount should be dragged for this game. UK media will let him off.

34,@TheFIFAAnalyst People quitting at 1-0 isn't a game issue. That's a community issue.

60,"@leach982 Actually they'll have to try harder to keep ppl from jumping to whatever game FIFA backs instead. 

Not promising it, but it's a possibility."
61,"EA CEO giving the exact same examples why EA &amp; FIFA separating might be good like we talked about on the stream. 🧠

For pros: EA can juice prize $ with new brands.

For Creators: more brand opps outside FIFA limits.

And looks like '24 will be the first w/o the name. https://t.co/6KDPJxecQr https://t.co/Ob7qL2ANjf"
