11,@cryptomachia @huxleysaga Process: surprise drop that didn't prioritize holders and had max 40 p/wallet. Gas was 0.35eth. Far too many holders missed out

40,@cmurda_eth @Gfunkera86 @garyvee Agree on that
41,"@cmurda_eth @Gfunkera86 @garyvee I mean this out of nothing but respect. Gary chases trends and does it early. Props to him, but he won’t be around long term. I’ve already watched him pop through 3 trends as the dominant influencer. G on the otherhand 🙏"
42,@caitbermy @kingg_stace More responsible but less profitable 😂
43,@Killer_KBee @BossBeautiesNFT My astronaut PFP is ready. They’ve earned their trip to the moon
44,The future of fashion. Looking forward to the reveal of my @neuno_io alpha pass 🔥 https://t.co/CSIegWZGAG
45,@QueenHodl_eth @direkkt @RumbleKongs Excited for reveal tomorrow
46,@mbisonco @huxleysaga 💯
47,@Schmoe @SWTOR @huxleysaga @BenMauroArt Damn I spent so many hours playing that game 🔥
48,@carlosgil83 @RumbleKongs Clean!
49,@LuminiciousYogi @huxleysaga Better tell the discord they may require spare pants in case of code brown
50,@LuminiciousYogi @huxleysaga I think I may need to be assigned new pants 💩
51,@MikeFogg24 Reported
52,March is going to be monstrous for @BossBeautiesNFT 🔥🚀 https://t.co/ol6fv02H3W
53,@cryptomachia @huxleysaga It was the same for me. The robots were already at 4eth when I started getting the comics. Now they’re around 10. Comics will be used for humans soon. The discord are great at onboarding new people if you need help too
54,@cryptomachia @huxleysaga Yep. 2.5wks to be exact haha
55,"When I say I buy into teams not projects, this is what I'm talking about... https://t.co/WgTU3gKHG5"
56,@MetaMarvin_ @NicoleBehnam lollll
57,@NicoleBehnam though you likely put in 27k worth of time just to get a mint spot
58,@the_freightrain @ProspectorPicks @huxleysaga A universe based around comics and gaming. The most similar reference point would be Punks Comics/Metahero Universe
59,Daaaamn! 8k unique holders... Thanks so much for the access @RumbleKongs. It's good to be Kong. https://t.co/DoRVVNEFlp
60,@money_ba11 @huxleysaga Yeah Ben’s great! He helped onboard me to the project when I minted my first issue #2’s. Project is super complex but in the best way.
61,@ArtHouseGarbage happy to send a string of audio clips from friends that were at the show 😂
62,"@coreyjlord @LFGreeds @StarcatchersNFT @3landersNFT same. to me the way that teams show up is more important. This team has given off arrogant vibes from the outset. Ppl will make bank off of the project and I'm happy for them, I just prefer to be off the hype train &amp; rely on strong teams"
63,Prime example that projects don't need hype to drive high value. I only found @huxleysaga 2 weeks ago. It's value is now 5x. The rocket is leaving the station. All aboard https://t.co/R17o4dDij3
64,@Killer_KBee @BossBeautiesNFT We like the boss’
65,@kjsouthernbelle Def premonition of future rug
66,"@LFGreeds @StarcatchersNFT @3landersNFT Glad I’m not the only one. I bailed after buying into moodrollers with a promise of allow list, then they said you needed a minimum of 3 after sell-out. It’s been nothing but red flags since"
67,"Am I the only one that wants absolutely nothing to do with Invisible Friends? The art is fire, but everything else to do with the project operations is a mix of red flags and arrogance. Would love to be wrong 🤷‍♂️"
68,@gstarlaw8 @RumbleKongs @doodles These are so dope mate! 👏👏
69,"@HecticlyRelaxed @SuperlativeSS I agree. I don’t want to be a part of a community that votes to lock long term holders out. It’s clear the comms weren’t loud enough for people to know it was happening. Love the art, but I’m out if the community votes against re-opening"
70,@ange888lover @SuperlativeSS I feel you. I missed artifact claiming window 🤦‍♂️
