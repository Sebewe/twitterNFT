17,"@jlottomusic to me, atheism is akin to cynicism or arrogance. 
I was once told, when miserably depressed, ‘depression is a disconnect from God’. 
to approach God is a humbling and vulnerable step. perhaps this is what at atheist has a difficult time with- humility or vulnerability"
18,"@jlottomusic the irony is-
an atheist is convinced their is no God, which cannot be proved. So they accept it on faith. Theist and atheist rely on faith for their unprovable positions. 

each position reflects a subjective reality"
