1,"Disappointed by the lack of elite meme generation from this State of The Union speech. 

I guess we’re all just exhausted?"
2,RT @j6cqueliiine: Friendly reminder that the drug dealers that knowingly sold Mac Miller fentanyl are going to trial this month 🙂
3,@fionais__online @raihan_ Yes.
4,@mwurst Damn! 🎯
5,"So interesting to see Nike, Adidas, and now Puma take completely different paths to establish themselves in web3 and the metaverse."
6,"RT @LazyLionsNFT: Well the cat, I mean Lion is out of the bag! 

Excited to partner with @puma. What does everyone wish for in this partner…"
7,RT @mediahotstepper: It’s happening… https://t.co/bQ3ks5wsPQ
8,@brookeleblanc “I’m a crypto bro and an astrology girl” 😭😭😭 you have my vote
9,"@mwurst @gabealonso Yup, you and everyone else who hasn’t yet realized that virtue signal woke-ism ended in 2021 😉"
10,@0xRaino @cregansollers !
11,One of those rare weeks where &gt;90% of my Spotify Discover Weekly playlist just... hits the spot.
12,"@OrchidBertelsen Yes and no. We all have to sell up the food chain no matter the org, but there are literally Sales people and their role in the ecosystem is very defined."
13,@jmmohr Depends on if you’re British or American (seriously).
14,@marioxcarrasco 100%
15,@JCPHankins @buffalogiu feel bad for you if your default view of how humans work is a shitty one.
16,"Get up earlier than everyone else, get that run out of the way, and the world is yours. 

Get up earlier than everyone else, get that Home Depot trip out of the way, and the world is yours."
17,"Home Depot is deploying the same strategy of catering to early risers (545AM, to be exact) as athletic shoe brands have been leveraging for over a decade now.

Pretty interesting given increased attention to trade craft and infrastructure needs etc. 

https://t.co/GjR81J7Mvb"
18,"I get that the dynamics are dictated by the direction that money flows, but just imagine if folks on the sales side dunked on buyers for their rude and bad behavior. The tables would turn rather quickly IMO."
19,Anyone on the buy side who dunks on salespeople for merely doing their jobs needs a serious reality check. Such a bad look.
20,@seyitaylor 4 products. 4 Ls for me.
21,"RT @FedorovMykhailo: Starlink — here. Thanks, @elonmusk https://t.co/dZbaYqWYCf"
22,@BriannaAhearn how does tiktok compensate creators if it's not via impressions?
23,@nrbauer Thanks! Just did this. You've likely saved me 5 min of productivity this month!
24,@philwinkle LOL
25,Man… https://t.co/sNkr1Ig6lA
26,"@guhlo absolutely. the extra revenue improves topline, but at what cost? i'm not sure how sophisticated most retail networks are without needing to spend a ton on middleware and specialist labor. 

outside of Amazon AMG, feels like Walmart is the one to beat in this growing sector."
27,@drollness LOL
28,@bradrobertson https://t.co/wLwlHikIh6
29,@guhlo the physical ad flyers are for their own promotions. the media network side of it is (mostly) to sell ad space and data to non-endemic advertisers.
30,"@thenewb Ah, grocery. Yes. Gone are the days of acceptable 2 hour windows."
31,"Every retail chain is now also a media network. 

(only a slight exaggeration)

https://t.co/MJzCJmMa2p"
32,"@thenewb Depends on what the order is. 

Would think that Amazon Prime 2-Day is still the expectation vs 15 min delivery apps for the vast majority of the country."
33,@JuiceboxCA I’d have to think that 10 min videos will only be pushed into your algo from channels or creators you subscribe to? Who knows.
34,@BetterCity Doesn’t YouTube have a short form product? I don’t think it’s popular but it exists.
35,"@JoseRMejia @seyitaylor @iiiitsandrea @zeynep White on white war gets higher ratings vs brown on brown, Jose."
36,@seyitaylor @JoseRMejia @iiiitsandrea @zeynep This was my original response to you (an observation about PR) and then for some reason this spiraled into a “who is more woke about this war” moment. I’m muting this from here on out. https://t.co/YWXrursK7U
37,"@moseskagan Depends on the nature of the $ conversation. Is this from a place of wealth and $ sophistication (“I don’t you not to buy that convertible”), or from a place of need? 

If it’s from the latter, it might not be as motivating. Can go either way."
38,"@seyitaylor @JoseRMejia @iiiitsandrea @zeynep Because that is who primarily uses TikTok, which was my point."
39,"@seyitaylor @iiiitsandrea @zeynep I tweeted something similar but used different words. Not sure if my POV is aligned with Nick’s, but that’s not the point. https://t.co/O28kW3Mph6"
40,"10 minute TikToks means that it’s going head to head with YouTube for time spent/day. 

My first thought was that YouTube has better search, but this is really a battle of discovery algorithms, right?"
41,"@iiiitsandrea @seyitaylor @zeynep I don’t agree or disagree with anyone’s takes based on what the Twitter mob decides. 

I don’t care about Nick’s tweet, I was replying to @seyitaylor’s take on that take. Especially for anyone under 21, this is the first time they are experiencing war online at this scale."
42,"@iiiitsandrea @seyitaylor @zeynep That’s great, I’ll check it out. 

The world changes fast and so does social media. I’d love to know what @zeynep thinks of the current conflict. I really doubt she’d say “it’s exactly like it reads in my book and nothing is different about this one.”"
43,I take screenshots of my HEIC image files bc I don’t want to be bothered to learn they why and how. https://t.co/Y9ZtvRFLBO
44,"@iiiitsandrea @seyitaylor @zeynep If this one really doesn’t feel that different to you vs other conflicts over the past 10 years because of insane speed of short form video social media and all the propaganda that we’re being exposed to, I really don’t know what to tell you. This one hits different."
45,"@iiiitsandrea @seyitaylor @zeynep Arab Spring was FB. 

Why is everyone trying to be reductive to “hey the internet has been around for all these wars, look” but we have literally never that this type of real time WarTok access ever (combined with most people not giving a shit about most other wars)."
46,@_santacruzer_ I’m talking about geopolitics and not really about business.
47,"@rachelmercer It’s been Kiev to me my whole life until recently. Even in video games, etc."
48,RT @katologic: Want to see the best usage of QR code on TV? It’s the #DonateUkraine QR code pinned on every Ukrainian channel. The best use…
49,"@seyitaylor Maybe this isn’t true, but the PR push from this one is tremendous and should be studied. Ukraine went on the social media offensive to win global hearts and minds, and it’s winning (not sure which way the war will go, but they seem to have us pretty convinced)."
50,RT @AndyTheGiant: Hey @packyM @notboringclub - well done. https://t.co/q3l2K8QtBM
51,"RT @MattNavarra: TikTok creeping in on YouTube territory

I can now upload videos up to 10 minutes long https://t.co/P2Mbf4ygWV"
52,@mgerrydoyle @alexadobrien What’s crazy to me is that Russians have almost zero OPSEC from the dozens of videos circulating on social revealing their positions and movements.

56,Everyone on LinkedIn is now a geopolitical expert. Completely unbearable.

61,@justseeby Agree! He was a guest on the All In Pod a couple of weeks ago and it was super interesting and informative.
62,"Interesting thread from Flexport about how the war will affect global logistics, a sector already hurt badly by the pandemic. 

Ukraine is a world leader in heavy lift air freight. https://t.co/UrePbsZQf7"
63,@endingwithali Definitely not a bubble lol.
64,@katologic ♥️
65,@JenniIn603 This was staged and taken in 2016.
66,@katologic Do you know if this is also happening tomorrow?
67,"Concise and informative thread of a possible outcome of severe sanctions, including SWIFT. 

Modern war is fought on many fronts. https://t.co/LZhfJpWtwi"
68,RT @elonmusk: @FedorovMykhailo Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.

Proud to see his growth over that time. Looking forward to the next 10+ years. https://t.co/Sl4Etqksyq"
71,"@claytonchambrs Nah just hating in general. I think this his collab signals peak high/low for this era. It’s too much, there doesn’t seem to be a reason to do it."

75,@michlschwrtz If by flex in this case you mean “poor financial decision.”
76,"@jelani9 @RexChapman He’s 44, with a 9 year old, and switched careers from entertainment to politics. He is eloquent and resolute in his delivery. 

He is young, authentic, and relatable, which is something that cannot be said about vast majority US politicians."
77,"@_santacruzer_ Would love to see this with less tacky wheels. Looks great. Their design language has been so good lately, all the way down to the Corolla."
78,@NaithanJones They should redirect their Car Thing (which feels DOA?) engineering resources towards this DJ hardware project… TAM might be larger than they think if it’s a pro/am tool.
79,"@NaithanJones Have been waiting a decade now for a Serato x Spotify collaboration. 

Would be an instant cop for me and I’d come out of DJ retirement just to mess with it."
80,"@tiasollecito It is pricey, but one of the few ways that you can literally buy your time, health, and sanity. 

Took me a very long time to understand this as well."
81,"@gabealonso I was too young to really have it sink in at the time. 

Working in media in NYC, I was going out 3-4x/ week and drinking way too much. 

It makes a whole ton of sense now that I’m a bit older."
82,@redgaskell I think it’s interesting how spirit and spirituality are important on both pyramids. Everyone needs something greater than themselves to believe in.
83,"I really hoped that my the time I hit my 40s, the complexion of board rooms would have changed significantly. In some ways, they have, but in many ways, progress has reversed. 

In any case, I’m going to keep at it with the hopes that the next gen can benefit from my stories."
84,"I’m sure its part of the reason why % of minority employees *decreases* over time on the corporate ladder. In addition to the work there is a layer of psychological stress from “making it”

BTW no shots fired at Publicis for these %s. Other holdcos straight out refused to share. https://t.co/PQ1tLCQ3Vo"
85,"This is just one of the things that most corporate environments don’t get when a majority of employees come from wealth. 

Those that don’t (usually minorities) face this level of cognitive dissociation every day, and it gets tougher up the latter. Guilt, imposter syndrome, etc."
86,"“The way you answered suggests that you feel a sense of guilt for taking advantage of the privileges that this company is relying on you use to be effective at what you do.” 

Essentially: Never apologize for flying Business Class when conducting business."
87,"Part of the process was taking a personality test. 

The person conducting this section was African American. As per usual, I was one of the only non-white employees in this training session. 

At the end of the day he pulled me aside and flat out told me: “Stop feeling guilty.”"
88,"A year later, my holdco put some young managers into a training program called “Best Athlete” that was about balancing your whole life to maintain peak performance at work. 

It was progressive and I was probably too young to really appreciate it. Here’s one of the charts: https://t.co/BXZ1shvits"
89,"A business coach later told me: 

“You have to think of yourself as an athlete. You’re not playing sports, but you are playing a game that will constantly stress your body and mind. Take advantage of every benefit and privilege that your company gives you with this in mind.”"
90,"This was one of those situations where I got reprimanded for doing what I thought was right. The difference in fare was close to $10K. 

He said “the value of you being awake and alert in that room is worth more than the difference in price. You need to sleep on that plane.”"
91,"Earlier in my career (I was 32 at the time), I was sent to Paris for a project where I’d have to take a red eye from NYC and go straight to the office for a presentation.

I booked Economy bc I wanted to be a good employee and save $. An MD ordered me to change to Business Class."
92,"Shifting between House of Brands vs Branded House as a strategy for new brand/category rollout. 

It makes sense. Had never thought of brand architecture serving that purpose, because it’s always been either/or. Interesting to think about. https://t.co/iDpRZ70Vxv"
93,"If you have to fly a lot, doing it in economy 100% of the time will wreck your body (and your mind if you do it enough). 

Also ignores free loyalty upgrades. 

If you’re *that* important, upgrading yourself once in a while is an investment in efficacy, health, and longevity."
94,“I’m rich and/or important but fly economy” is the weirdest virtue signaling flex.
95,"@vbw_riakosher @mywifequit Not being exhausted if you need something to do when you land. 

Having enough room to get real work done. Some economy class seats aren’t wide enough to type comfortably."
96,"RT @slavin_fpo: This video made it all feel far more real than anything else I’ve read or watched. 

Maybe it’s the white collar job titles…"
