1,What's your favorite business crypto on/off-ramp for ETH + USDC. We're in the market. 👀
2,"I find the @Pixelmon Kevin meme absolutely hilarious, but then I remember that each time a Kevin is sold, more trading fees flow to a team that sold that work for 3 ETH. 🙄"
3,@lovennft 🙋‍♀️
4,Enjoyed participating in this panel put on by @hello_we3! Great to speak alongside some true legends in the space. https://t.co/w3uWwYerDk
5,"Just minted 3 @thesunniesnft with presale and noticed that others were listing on secondary for just above mint. In a bull market like we're in, it made sense to sweep 3 more with @gemxyz for a total of 6.

From a % return perspective, this felt like a low risk, high upside play."
6,"RT @AllysonDowney: We launched @meta_angels not only with 10,000 spectacular PFPs from @aslanruby – but also with 10,000 unique angel descr…"
7,Graph from the @Honest_NFT team shows some seriously suspect behavior from the @Pixelmon project in mint distribution. https://t.co/VI0sYNyje1
8,@rammyeth Wow that was fast!

14,"Okay @proof_xyz holders. 19 WETH collection offer on @LooksRareNFT.

Feel free to go mint your grail and take my offer of quick liquidity. 👀 https://t.co/cpzIFULCA5"
15,"Imagine @Treasure_DAO Bridgeworld treasure emissions applied to a @Pokemon game.

Most have uncapped supply and can be gained through ""questing,"" but legendaries (grin+honeycomb) have fixed supply.

Getting a legendary would be life-changing.

(see: https://t.co/QPGqEGSH05)"
16,"@InvsbleFriends activity following reveal has been interesting. A sharp decline followed by some real recovery - back up to 7.1 ETH.

I can't say I love the look of all of them, but mine gives solid dad vibes. https://t.co/RhuiKtYb3T"
17,@IndigetalG @mooncat2878 @InvsbleFriends I think @HODLGANG_NFT was pretty similar honestly.
18,Hey @proof_xyz holders. Mind dropping the floor now that Grails is done so I can buy one? 😅
19,@dearearth_ @dingalingts You missed the craziest part of that profile in your highlight. Fifty @Ghxsts. https://t.co/XWO1abasgn
20,"@cclccl4461 Yeah that’s political, but most of what I’m seeing is genuine messages of concern and support."
21,@rhemanth93 @AzukiZen @3landersNFT No thanks. I’ll just stick with my punk.
22,@0xinc Have you checked out what we're building at @ProblySomething? Feel free to DM me if you want details.
23,RTFKT truly just keeps delivering. Amazing to see what a project can do with the resources of Nike + massive secondaries behind them. https://t.co/7u45kOXn3Y
24,@asimplenoochie @3landboy @mooncat2878 @chinz_nft Happy to help! Great looking 3lander.
25,"2 market notes:

1⃣ We're still far from global crash territory. A true crash would hit much harder.
2⃣ I'm still hodling everything."
26,"@cclccl4461 Solidarity != politics

This is one of the most consequential aggressions by a global power in decades. Feels like it's worth mentioning before we talk about the floor price of tubby cats."

28,The best metaverse in the world wouldn't change our need for physical security.
29,"@acollins789 Played out pretty much like this. Doodles stayed around .7 - 1 for a while while increasing ownership distribution, then it suddenly launched."
30,Thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine today. Deeply saddening to see the needless loss of life.

32,RT @mondoggg: Lol this is why you don’t list first. https://t.co/jha6MYaiRl
33,"Picked up my first @meta_angels this morning.

Loved hearing from their founder @acav last night at @hello_we3 on their vision for an inclusive NFT brand and am proud to support them. https://t.co/Q6uvkHFWZo"
34,"Yesterday saw almost exactly the pattern a @3landersNFT holder would hope for - ⬆️ owner distribution (+~300) and a rising floor - to 1.6 ETH.

Could see some  retracement here, but the macro is trending in the right direction. https://t.co/6Aw7edKmZS"
35,"@SpaceballEth @Salty__Sandwich @AzukiZen Love nonbinary representation too! @meta_angels is crushing it in this regard.

I think capturing a combination of prototypical ""man"" features along with prototypical ""woman"" features actually enables solid nb representation in a generative collection."
36,"@Simon_Goldberg @Gfunkera86 @AzukiZen Yes @nuclearnerds as well! Okay, azuki actually modeled diversity off of other projects 😂"
37,"@Gfunkera86 @AzukiZen @MetaHero_ Also, metahero doesn’t get enough credit for on chain, provable randomness, but that’s a rant for another tweet 😅"
38,"@Gfunkera86 @AzukiZen Yes, yes. @MetaHero_ too, no question."
39,@AzukiZen This tweet was prompted by trying to find a @3landersNFT that I actually wanted to use as a pfp and coming up woefully short.
40,"We need more collections like @AzukiZen that have equal representation of both genders instead of just leaving it to ""women"" collections to handle gender diversity for the whole space."
41,@WomenandWeapons @0xElan @mai_on_chain @meta_angels Right back at you!
42,@preetinft @3landersNFT @Ghxsts Legendary. Congratulations @preetinft.
43,"@arXmedes Yeah, I wouldn’t go so far as to call these a future blue chip, but it’s apparent that the community loves them.

I like them but will hedge on the rise and hold one long term."
44,"Floor hardly dipped. Back up to 1.5 ETH.

I haven't seen the @Ghxsts discord go this wild over a collection since @coolcatsnft."
45,@TurksTokens Still not as cool as that coffee head though. 🙃
46,Me studying game theory in business school: TELL ME EVERYTHING. https://t.co/wlM5cmbsPf
47,"@Mantaroth Ah yes, absolutely. I would sell if it came down to it.

And indeed will one day."
48,"3Landers. First call I’m making in a while, but I see these running up.

Good ownership stats and people paying up for rares. Doodle vibes."
49,"Some pieces I would really struggle to sell because they feel so synonymous with me.

My punk, my originxl, my demxn - they've been my pfps for too long and, dammit, i've gotten attached. https://t.co/j4G8T0mUOB"
50,"RT @mooncat2878: 1/13

51,"@BoredApe1000 Wait, we're in a bear market? Isn't azuki still at &gt; 11 ETH?"
52,@SoCalBeachDaze Agreed on the macro point. What are we looking at in this graph?
53,"Even with ETH headed downward📉, I'm not convinced we will see another multi-year crypto downturn.

There are so many people here, and NFTs are just too darn fun for folks to go back to the way things were."
54,@ryancarson @Coinbase_NFT We really do share so many of the same perspectives on the market.
55,@carlcortright Agree completely. A lot of DAO tooling also could easily be swapped out for web2 b2b software.
56,"@Sylviashaw2021 Yep, happy to be proven wrong here! Floor at time of this tweet is 5.3 ETH.

@RemindMe_OfThis in a month."
57,@Sylviashaw2021 I would be cautious of overinvesting in the newest trending thing. I'd bet on the cool cats / doodles team over the mfers team (insofar as the latter exists) any day.
58,"@Sylviashaw2021 Varies on the project!

BAYC + Doodles are both doing a great job of building an expansive and thoughtful brand + community with decent appeal outside NFTs. I like the mfers, but I will be surprised if they find mass appeal.

My thesis on punks: https://t.co/BOeOoTSkm5"
59,Excited to be participating in this introductory session on NFTs this Tuesday in collaboration with @hello_we3. https://t.co/ka3AaFksLD
60,"@JxnetNFT Agree completely. When I back into my general investment thesis for NFTs, it's pretty simple - ""is it novel?"""
61,"I don't own any, but I will admit that mfers are a vibe.

Personally, though, I don't see lasting value there. Were I holding, I'd be averaging out of the position."

66,"Lots to be said about last night’s successful phishing attacks.

Simplest thing: buy a hardware wallet and never use it for daily trading.

Use it to hold all valuable NFTs you don’t plan to sell in the next 2-3 weeks.

Transfer to a hot wallet for any trades."
67,@fourpoops Pega. 😅
68,"Phase 1 of the @ProblySomething Genesis Pass sale has ended, and exactly 100 have been minted.

Speaking for the whole team, we are so grateful for your support.

We are going to build something incredible, and that starts with one of the best communities by our side."
69,Am absolutely humbled by the faith you all are placing in me and this team. https://t.co/GJYPDzC42C
70,@CozomoMedici Love to see it. Good use of the funds and fair return plan.
71,@ryancarson *collateral
72,"For those of you that have not yet minted but plan to, please do so ASAP.

At this time, we have no plans to extend phase 1 participants into future mint periods absent extenuating circumstances. https://t.co/6Sx0SK8vB1"
73,@ryancarson Feel very much the same. Can’t be in the short term game on these. Especially with options to use them as lending colateral down the road.
74,@vibemaxi @MetaHero_ @pixelvault_ @Gfunkera86 Definitely maximizing your vibes. Love to see it.

86,"@jenny_colgate Problem is that this limits some of the benefits of web3.

Ie quick transaction finality, permanence."

90,@youfoundanisha I feel seen. Hope to see you at the conference...much later this afternoon.
91,@jenny_colgate I worry the matrix might implode.

It has my full support and is worth a look. https://t.co/1FKOPljwzg"

94,"@andrwwang ugh I'm ngmi.

Can I !plumb in the discord for 2 years to make up for it?"
95,"One request of Discord mods. Please do not @everyone to let us know that you've posted your third tweet for the day.

It just makes it more likely for me to 🔇or 🗑️ the server."

97,@mugatu_eth AGH got me.
98,"In just 3/7 days since we opened the allowlist-only mint for @ProblySomething Genesis Passes, 42/111 allowlisted individuals have already minted.
