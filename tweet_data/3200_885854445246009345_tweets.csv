54,"@neolti @desoprotocol Plus, if core node goes offline, DeSo goes offline. (I need to read more into this but this is what I have heard)
3) Just because you offer a blockchain and a public API doesn’t mean you’re decentralized"
55,"@neolti @desoprotocol 1) Don’t agree with creator coins. Think it sends the wrong message
2) Correct me if I’m wrong, but the nodes don’t work similar to Ethereum or Bitcoin. The core DeSo node is responsible for everything. There is a way that if it can change data and trickle down to all nodes."

57,"@AnonymAditya @desoprotocol Not saying they can’t turn it around, but from what I’ve seen, every tough decision they seem to choose centralization. Not a good look in my opinion. 

That, and the fact they claim to be “decentralized”. 

That’s why I left the platform."
58,"@neolti @desoprotocol Yea, the data is on a publicly viewable blockchain but that doesn’t make you decentralized in terms of core architecture."
59,"@neolti @desoprotocol https://t.co/hB42iJdUJr

And to be clear, I don’t have a problem and actually agree with most of what is said in the article.

I disagree with the fact they claim to be “decentralized” when they aren’t. 

It’s a centralized Node JS server at the end of the day."
60,"@TheWorldNFTs @desoprotocol It’s very true. More decentralized than Twitter, sure. But in comparison to 99% of other crypto protocols/chains, it’s way more centralized."
