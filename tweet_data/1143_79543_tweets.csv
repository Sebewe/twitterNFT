1,@Mxatrx Maybe. What’s the long term plan? Since there is a brand collaboration here it creates legal complexities.
2,@lizasperling Great points Liza. So does cash still matter? It depends in the vendors still accept cash in a digital world.

53,@tcpeter @armano It’s a good point.
54,"@tcpeter @armano Yes, Sequoia announced a $450M fund last week, Crypto,com launched $500m fund last month, Katie Haun just launched intention for a $1B fund. A16Z is on fund 3 for $2.2B.

History: Web2 started off as “the commons” what happened?"
72,"@jamespoulter Users and shareholders are not always the same. Example: There is a very large retail store that caters to lower income, the shareholders don’t live in those regions."
73,@dotBen Oh boy. :)

What will FB Meta do?"
80,"@markdrury General turnaround. New revenues in metaverse, restored market cap, influx of new replenished users, solid roadmap into future, market sentiment positive. Better for world, not worse."
81,"@peipeicyu Yes, I'm equating Facebook with Meta at the time being as I don't think the Meta brand has full manifested."

83,"Can Facebook turn it around? Yes, it's absolutely feasible, other companies have done it:

-Apple
-Microsoft
-Dell
-AMD
-even Twitter had a lull a few years ago

Do you think Facebook can make this change?"
84,"@ingenesist It's social engineering, not just physical materials."
85,"@augieray Can Facebook turn it around? I say, Yes; Microsoft, Apple did. Twitter was in a lull a few years ago. Assets: many users, cash, talent. 

Will they? We will see."
