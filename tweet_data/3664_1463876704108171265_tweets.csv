PREMIUM ANALYSIS
Written by: @elliotkoss"
3,"20/ Summary

@invsblefriends is one of the biggest NFTs to mint. It's some of the most popular animated artwork w a Sotheby's deal already in place, merchandise on the way, and plans for a toy.

Unless you're already on the Allow List, you'll have to buy on secondary.

NFA. DYOR."
4,"19/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE (2 of 2)

While the mint price of 0.25 ETH is on the higher end, it still feels low for this mint given the demand. This means the team won't be maximizing the value of the work they've created.

Luckily royalties will ensure they're compensated."
5,"18/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE (1 of 2)

There is not much of a roadmap for this NFT. It appears that the art alone is what will sustain it.

Granted, given the insane demand for this NFT, a clear roadmap isn't necessarily required.

Plus, the team could always add more later."
6,17/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE
7,"16/ THINGS I LIKE (3 of 3)

The team sold some merchandise pre-mint, and plans to offer future merchandise and 'collectibles' exclusively for HODLers.

And per a tweet in mid-Jan, it looks like toys are in the plans 👀

https://t.co/EgGEadxyhk https://t.co/w3YUCDRjsZ"
8,"15/ THINGS I LIKE (2 of 3)

The art is amongst some of the strongest I've seen, though I'm not an art connoisseur. 

But Sotheby's is. And @invsblefriends has a deal with them. https://t.co/XvvRvlql8h"
9,"14/ THINGS I LIKE (1 of 3)

There is a HUGE community that loves this art and has embraced the artist.

The animated art is compelling and I could watch it for hours.

I may just go to the OpenSea collection page and watch them after they mint."
10,13/ THINGS I LIKE
11,"12/ Have I bought it?

No, and I likely won't.

I don't own @SlimHoods or @MoodRollers (the two NFTs that when owned enough granted AL access), and I don't spend time grinding for AL access.

But I'd mint if I could. This NFT has off-the-charts demand."
12,"11/ So how'd I hear about it?

Since December, I've been hearing about @InvsbleFriends in the @CPGclub discord. It's been on my radar for a while."
13,"10/ 3️⃣ Is roadmap strong enough and realistic?

There is no roadmap or promise of much. There are some mentions of merchandise and toys.

But this is an NFT where art is the primary focus, so a roadmap isn't the primary focus."
14,"9/ 2️⃣ What's mint size to follower count ratio?

5,000. This pales in comparison to the nearly 500K Twitter followers.

This is already one of the most anticipated NFT mints ever."
15,"8/ 1️⃣ Is team public or doxxed?

Yes. @motionmarkus is the sole creator behind @InvsbleFriends, and he's aided by @RNDMCHARACTERS."
16,"7/ There are some things I like about this mint and some I don't.

I'll review the 3 criteria to explain why I chose to feature it, highlight the good, dig into the bad, and end with a summary.

https://t.co/h2ComOsuAu"
17,"6/ Money Raised

The NFT sale could raise $3.4M (@ $2,700 USD/ETH).

This is the size of a seed round, tho the team isn't committing to using them for a roadmap.

5,000 * 0.25 = 1,250 ETH"

Invisible Friends is an animated GIF collection of friendly characters with merchandise and toys planned, expanding the Random Character Collective."

PREMIUM ANALYSIS
Written by: @elliotkoss"
26,"21/ Summary

@CloudFriendsNFT is a mental health focused NFT w plans to donate to charities and create a safe space in the metaverse for mental health conversations.

Activity seems light, but the mission is worthwhile.

If mental health is important to you, look into this one."
27,"20/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE (3 of 3)

The plans for creating a space in the metaverse don't seem concrete. Granted, few projects have solid plans in place when they raise their initial NFT, so it's not necessarily out of the ordinary."
28,"19/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE (2 of 3)

Providing donations is noble, but what happens when the money runs out. There is no clear on-going funding mechanism (other than royalties), which could limit the long-term prospects."
29,"18/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE (1 of 3)

Despite the positivity in this community, it doesn't feel like there's a large community that can support this NFT. With 16K people in the Discord, activity seems a tad light."
30,17/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE
31,"16/ THINGS I LIKE (3 of 3)

The plans for the metaverse are also kind, w a goal of creating a space in the metaverse for open mental health conversations.

There's even an acknowledgement / concern for the metaverse becoming a crutch for escape versus a tool for help. Thoughtful. https://t.co/qCEdltOlQC"
32,"15/ THINGS I LIKE (2 of 3)

The team has shared some of their experiences that have prompted them to create this NFT, and they sound genuine in their ambition to make donations to charities and grow this community. https://t.co/28wk99LzOv"
33,"14/ THINGS I LIKE (1 of 3)

This community is built to spread positivity and be a safe space. It felt comfortable and welcoming perusing the Discord, which is quite the departure from many other Discords.

This team is building an intentional space I enjoyed. https://t.co/sDs2w594py"
34,13/ THINGS I LIKE
35,"12/ Have I bought it?

Not yet, but I'll mint my allocation of 1 NFT.

Supporting mental health communities is important to me. Because of that, I'm willing to give more of a benefit of the doubt, even if I have open questions such as what you'll read below."
36,"11/ So how'd I hear about it?

@CPGclub was allocated 75 Allow List spots and I won one of the raffle spots. We're also a community that is highly supportive of mental health projects (one of many reasons I love about this community)."
37,"10/ 3️⃣ Is roadmap strong enough and realistic?

It's fairly vague or limited. Donations to charity are nice, tho.

The idea of space in the metaverse for HODLers is interesting, but this team will need to attract a large or faithful following for this to sustain. https://t.co/VExwqRVg9r"
38,"9/ 2️⃣ What's mint size to follower count ratio?

5,000 vs the typical 10K, so they've been thoughtful here.

But the low utility / largely community / charity focus has resulted in medium to slow Discord activity.

The cost is higher than some, so this mint could go slow."
39,"8/ 1️⃣ Is team public or doxxed?

Not really. 4-person team has 2 fully anon and 2 public anon (@sap922 ‘08 &amp; @abearinaflannel Mar ‘21).

This is a mental health start-up and, there are valid safety and mental health reasons to be anon.

I'll be writing more on this another time."
40,"7/ There are some things I like about this mint and some I don't.

I'll review the 3 criteria to explain why I chose to feature it, highlight the good, dig into the bad, and end with a summary.

https://t.co/h2ComOsuAu"
41,"6/ Money Raised

The NFT sale could raise $1.35M (@ $3,000 USD/ETH).

This is the size of a seed round, tho this team is largely donating funds to charity and building a community vs building a product.

5,000 * .09 = 450 ETH"
42,"5/ NFT Description

Cloud Friends is an NFT project to donate to mental health orgs, build a space in metaverse and develop a community to advocate for mental heath awareness."

PREMIUM ANALYSIS
Written by: @elliotkoss"
50,"25/ Summary

@StarcatchersNFT is a hyped PFP with no public roadmap, utility, or perks. And there's no public mint.

If you want in, you'll likely need to follow them and pray. Or wait for OpenSea.

Their website is supposed to launch Feb 18.

Good luck researching this one more."
51,"24/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE (3 of 3)

There isn't a website and the Twitter has limited info.

My team and I struggled gathering info for this report. For an account with 80K followers that seems odd."
52,"23/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE (2 of 3)

I have a preference for substance over marketing. 

Some projects do well when hyping up their project to astronomical levels. Others set expectations they can't meet.

It's not clear which this one is. But they aren't leading with substance."
53,"22/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE (1 of 3)

It seems like this is only an artwork project. They are very hush-hush on the entire project. They're purposely not sharing info, instead waiting for reveal.

I hope they pull something off, but I have concerns."
54,21/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE
55,"20/ THINGS I LIKE (4 of 4)

They had given out Allow List spots to Weather Report, but given the drama recently, they've rescinded these spots.

This is a classy move given what's happened. 

We'll write about Weather Report later.

https://t.co/Pz9Vypv8yE"
56,"19/ THINGS I LIKE (3 of 4)

The community seems to really respond to this team which explains the interest and visibility of this project.

I didn't get @AzukiZen, either, so this project could easily be in my blindspot.

https://t.co/5Nvb2vOw0A"
57,"18/ THINGS I LIKE (2 of 4)

The team has ambitions to do positive things in the NFT space.

While this Twitter space confirmed the plans are vague and unclear, the team does share a broad vision that's positive.

https://t.co/s7OAitQBsd"
58,"17/ THINGS I LIKE (1 of 4)

The level of interest in this NFT means that it could have a sustained audience of buyers.

With that said, we've seen high hype projects backfire from their exclusivity. Granted, the mint price is low enough that this could do well."
59,16/ THINGS I LIKE
60,"15/ Have I bought it? (2 of 2)

BUT, the fact that this team has already pushed out a contract that is consistent with even the minimum info they've shared makes me more confident in what they're saying.

I'll consider buying this one on OpenSea."
61,"14/ Have I bought it? (1 of 2)

No. I'm not on the Allow List, but if I was, I would mint.

This is not the type of project I understand. There is no utility, no perks, and no roadmap.

This could be like @AzukiZen where team strength carried the NFT. I didn't get it...BUT..."
62,"13/ So how'd I hear about it?

@floornfts did a giveaway for some raffle spots. I didn't win one."
63,"12/ 3️⃣ Is roadmap strong enough and realistic?

There is no public roadmap. The team is planning to build based on community feedback."
64,"11/ 2️⃣ What's mint size to follower count ratio?

10,000. This pales in comparison with their Twitter following, and they have created so many partnerships that they expect to not even have a public mint.

https://t.co/1N4XEz06rg"
65,"10/ 1️⃣ Is team public or doxxed?

The team of public anons (@Beutrec, @Kamedez, @ethmaurice, @RovyETH) largely have accounts &gt;1 year, so no yellow flag.

They've partnered with @VinnieHager. 

https://t.co/VAr4DccwvR"
66,"9/ There are some things I like about this mint and some I don't.

I'll review the 3 criteria to explain why I chose to feature it, highlight the good, dig into the bad, and end with a summary.

https://t.co/h2ComOsuAu"
67,"8/ Money Raised

The NFT sale could raise $3.3M (@ $3,000 USD/ETH).

This is the size of a seed round, but it's delayed so the funding won't be available for the team for a bit.

10,000 * 0.111 = 1,110 ETH"
68,"7/ Anything unique to know? (2 of 2)

I asked @curtisjcummings to check if there was a way to confirm that they were going to follow-thru on what they claimed...

And he found a contract that is consistent with what the team said, which is a good sign. https://t.co/siZx9jsiGn"
69,"6/ Anything unique to know? (1 of 2)

The team has announced a delayed release of funds which is intended to align incentives so that the team is more likely to work on this project for the long-term.

70,"5/ NFT Description

73,"I encourage you to read further below and DYOR since this is NFA. But I came away more confident in the team.

I asked if I could join their Allow List, and I will mint when it opens up.

I have no idea if this will do well - I just want to support thoughtful teams."
74,"3. They have a long-term mindset. Their funding structure indicates this, but so does their thoughtful planning.

4. They have plans to grow beyond art. I can't say more, but there is a plan in mind.

5. There is a plan to continue providing value to the Gen0 NFT HODLers."
75,"1. Maurice and the team are super thoughtful. Each of my questions had a thorough and considered answer.

2. They have a roadmap. It's vague and they aren't sharing it intentionally so that they under promise and over deliver. They've learned from other projects."

87,"21/ Summary

@decentraliens is an education-focused NFT that is leveraging the power of Web3 communities to create a new type of group learning environment with a mechanism to fund projects. 

Worth looking a little closer."
88,"20/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE (3 of 3)

I don't understand the DAO structure. If it's purely to vote on which projects to fund, then it seems like more flash than substance. I'd rather the team make these decisions, sell courses, and only NFT HODLers eligible for funding."
89,"19/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE (2 of 3)

Without an income generator, as DAO funds deplete, there will be no more operational funds.

The DAO could vote to monetize the content, but then that could devalue NFT (just as would running out of DAO funds).

Long-term viability isn't clear."
90,"18/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE (1 of 3)

There is no funding mechanism outside of the initial NFT sale (and royalties).

The only people who can take courses must own the NFT, and the DAO will control decisions once this is launched.

So there's no income generator built into the model. https://t.co/zt253dEGIn"
91,17/ THINGS I DON'T LIKE
92,"16/ THINGS I LIKE (3 of 3)

This team is coming up with a variety of educational tools, and it's easy to imagine that once they're funded, they'll create even more tools and learning experiences.

I'm eager to learn more in the Web3 space."
93,"15/ THINGS I LIKE (2 of 3)

50% of the NFT money raised is being set aside in the treasury to help fund promising projects that 'students' build among other things. https://t.co/qu44AwMGUj"
94,"14/ THINGS I LIKE (1 of 3)

Creating a community of builders for Web3 is going to be important for the development of Web3, and the idea of setting up a way for everyone to learn and build together embraces the best parts about Web3. https://t.co/zeQDGjSH7m"
95,13/ THINGS I LIKE
96,"12/ Have I bought it?

Not yet, but I'm going to buy 2. I don't buy many SOL NFTs, and I have a soft spot for education-focused NFTs.

I have questions about their DAO and long-term viability, so I'm curious to get some experience with how they structure / execute it."
97,"11/ So how'd I hear about it?

At the end of January a @CPGclub member offered everyone a spot on the Allow List, so it's been on my radar for the past couple weeks."
98,"10/ 3️⃣ Is roadmap strong enough and realistic?

Yes. A collective learning community focused on building in Web3 fills a need, and the high level of interest means they have a good chance to grow with their community.

But there are some long-term viability questions. See below."
99,"9/ 2️⃣ What's mint size to follower count ratio?

10,000. About 2.5x the Discord (3.9K). 

1.5 SOL ≈ 0.05 ETH ≈ $150

We don't know the size of the Allow List.

Given that each can mint 10, and the public mint has an unlimited mint amount, this has a good chance to sell out."
