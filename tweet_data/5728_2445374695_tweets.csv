19,"Carbon #nft (my new profile pic) by @muratpak can be sent to a burn address via https://t.co/jLGEKipRkv and receive #Ash token in exchange according to a bonding curve. 

 Would be amazing to see this mechanism with other non-Pak or non-ash collections.

33,"So if this is money as we know it, and this is how it works, money being this psychological concept, 

In this context:
-What is #bitcoin? 
-What is #ethereum?

🤷‍♂️"
34,"This trust is the sole backing for most of the money in the world. In the bakery example, Mr. Greedy is trusting that one day Mrs McDonut will sell pastries profitably and will pay back the loan with interest

The entire enterprise is based on trust in an imaginary future""👇"
35,"But if this is a fraud then the entire modern economy is a fraud. 

The fact is, it's not a deception, but rather a tribute to the amazing abilities to the human imagination. What enables banks and the entire economy to survive and flourish, is our trust in the future👇"
36,"If all the account holders at Barclay's bank suddenly demand their money, Barclay's will promptly collapse unless the gov steps in to save it. The same is true of all other banks in the world. It sounds like a giant ponzi scheme doesn't it? 👇"
37,"The contractor will eventually have $10mil in his account, even dough the bank has only $1mil in the vaults. Banks are allowed to lend $10 for every $1 they actually poses which means that 90% of all the money in our bank accounts is not covered by actual coins and notes👇"
38,"How much money does the contractor have in his account now?
He's got $3mil 

But how much money is actually sitting in the bank?

Still just $1mil. The same $1mil that's been in the bank all along. 

Current US banking law permits the bank to repeat this 7 more times.👇"
39,"Mrs. McDonut is not pleased but she can hardly stop the job in the middle. 

She pays another visit to the bank, convinces Mr. Greedy for an additional loan and he puts another $1mil in her account. 

She transfers the money to the contractors account. 👇"
40,"How much money cash is actually located in the bank's safe? 

Yes, $ 1 mil !

It does not stop there. Two months into the job, Stone informs McDonut that due to unforeseen problems and expenses, the bill for constructing the bakery will actually be $2 mil. 👇"
41,"His price is $1mil. When she pays him with a cheque drawn on her account, Stone deposits it in his account with the Greedy bank. 

So how much money does Stone have in his bank account? 

Right, $2mil !
👇"
42,"She goes to the bank, presents her business plan to Mr. Greedy and persuades him that it is a worth while investment. 

He issues her a $1mil loan by crediting her account in the bank with that sum. McDonut now hires Mr. Stone, the contractor, to build her bakery 👇"
43,"He deposits this sum in Mr. Greedy's bank. The bank now has $1mil in capital. 

Meantime, Mrs. McDonut, an experienced chef, thinks she sees a business opportunity. There are no bakeries in her part of town, but she does not have enough money of her own so...👇

44,"Very interesting thread with a question at the end. Quoting @harari_yuval 's Sapiens: 

""Imagine a simple example:
Mr. Greedy, a financier, sets up a bank.
Mr. Stone, a contractor in town, finishes his first big job, receiving payment in cash for $1mil👇
