idk i think this ruined the integrity of what Dominic Fike was trying to do when he took this acting gig (which was to showcase his music) 

y'all did him dirty — he has versatility &amp; writes good songs. this wasn't that."

I refuse to believe Dominic Fike actually wrote that flop. REFUSE."

27,"@joshqharris @kacyhill @catalogworks the best scams will always have the best user experience, as long as it makes the shareholders rich. 

instagram too, until recent history."
28,"@xedraism honestly, yeah that’s probably one of the most important lessons I’ve learned too."
29,"@joshqharris @kacyhill @catalogworks musicians aren’t “making money” to begin with tho. 

they’re paying back a loan from a record advance they are indebted to by their label. which takes years, decades sometimes.

are you saying your favorite artist’s music is worth a fraction of a cent every time you consume it?"
30,"@joshqharris those groups sometimes treat things like a moodboard in order for u to pass the vibe check, as superficial as it sounds, creatively on the same level or whatever,,,,, idk what I’m saying just thinking about how those types of friend groups work"
31,"@joshqharris I feel like ppl in that sphere also obsessively film artsy things on tiktok now too,,, I don’t have the energy to do that lol,,, but I know a lot of people find friends through tiktok too."
32,"@joshqharris I feel like u definitely could get away with it in nyc bc most of the arts + film scene is embroiled with money + power anyways. 

I feel like ppl wear their work on their sleeve over there but leave it at the door when they’re doing something creative / partying."
33,"@joshqharris I say this because I had tons of friends outside of tech living in San Francisco. 

tech people give SF a bad wrap for “not having scenes” but it’s because the art + skate scenes are impenetrable to people who outwardly work in tech + ppl trying to buy clout."
34,"@joshqharris music &amp; film scenes are a good place to start. fashion &amp; skating too. 

also have like at least one social media that doesn’t include anything about tech at all. 

this is so ppl don’t think ur lame but also like the first step in separating ur job from ur personal identity."

I say nations because the US has done horrific human right violations against immigrants seeking a better life. Fuck ICE."

64,"If you’re a fan and want to support the artists you listen to… buy one of their songs with your friends.

It’s more than they’ll ever get if you’re in the 1% of listeners on streaming platforms. 

If you split it right, it’s the price of concert ticket."
65,"@kacyhill literally has an entire album out on @catalogworks — and her reserve price equates to more than she’ll probably ever see from Spotify streams. 

Her most streamed song with over 19 MILLION streams only made her $59k"
66,"I think one thing that people that are anti-NFTs don’t realize is that,,,, musicians get paid less than a cent per stream on Spotify.

Even if you make it, you don’t. 

You’re in debt to your label and if you let them control your vision — you become their puppet."
