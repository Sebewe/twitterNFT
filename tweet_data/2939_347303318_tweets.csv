20,@supreetkay Seems room for both. IRL events need to meet demands. Bitcoin NA conference in January seemed more infrastructure focused. As an artist &amp; designer I’m thrilled with what NFTs are doing for use case on chain. 2017 crash was due to lots of infrastructure vision &amp; work w/o use case.
21,@NFTherder A frustrating reality but just wanted to share that your insights in this space are such a game changer for me.

64,@zsilvs303 @daliakatan Telling artists how to make art that you want them too is ironically why web3 has so much potential. But yes if you want community and a diverse one you want to make sure people see themselves in your art.
65,@daliakatan @zsilvs303 @NotYourBroNFT @CryptoTechWomen Jews being positively represented in the world and admired for our culture and conviction is definitely not the same challenge as Jewish artists making Jewish art that represents their journey and connection. The later being critiqued on how artists express themselves.
66,@daliakatan @zsilvs303 Art is subjective. I think it’s 🔥. Plenty of space for amazing Jewish women artists to showcase their joy in Judaism. Let’s support! @sefiracreative
