15,"@Vince_Van_Dough In case you all didn’t notice, Unigrids DO MAKE SOUND.
Cheers and happy buy"
16,@galaxyRTK @pixelpete @ArtOnBlockchain Agree 💯. Imo better sticking with QUALITY drops at the RIGHT price.
17,"@thetippetytop 5% “slice of system” means 5% of system load weighted by res, comm and industrial. Was pretty standard when dealing with reinsurance companies.
Not sure about this context though"
18,@ki_young_ju Either price goes up or down

20,@dmitricherniak Only regret was not buying MOAR after they sold out at 4x-5x
21,@dmitricherniak They are still crazily undervalued 😬
22,@spencernoon @iamDCinvestor also I believe there's at least a couple of AB projects missing here
23,@Vince_Van_Dough Did you forget a zero perhaps?

28,@dmitricherniak @galaxyRTK @artblocks_io Congrats Dmitri!
29,@iamDCinvestor @dmitricherniak @FeralFile I had the same thinking process but then I couldn’t pass on a $75 priced masterpiece made by Dmitri
30,"@mdudas @Zeneca_33 @artblocks_io It still feels like
1) there are too many
2) they are over priced- thanks to the Dutch auction system 

You literally have masterpieces in the curated set that raised way less than unknown factory projects.
I guess bull market"
31,@Zeneca_33 @mdudas @artblocks_io Factory drops feel like a cash grabs for the most part. Stick with curated and selected playground IMO

So you can strategize around that. But yea, sell 40ish % of the yield earned for USDC and you should be covered."

87,@icebergy_ phase 1 was SOOOO good
88,@catjoanli @iamDCinvestor @AlchemixFi @scupytrooples yea you earn interests by loaning your assets on either Compound or Aave
89,"@catjoanli @iamDCinvestor @AlchemixFi @scupytrooples I still struggle to find the innovation here.
If I lend ETH to Compound or AAVE and borrow USDC against, I will earn interest on ETH that I can use to pay my debt (+ interests) on the USDC loan. 
So Alchemix automates this process; where's the primitive though?"
90,@Robin__masters @AdamScochran @AlamedaTrabucco you should select your strategic partners more carefully
