THEY ARE NOT THE ONES CHOOSING THIS AND STAND TO SUFFER MASSIVELY FROM IT.

56,"@artxvnft Is there anywhere that I could find information on the legal structure of the organization?

Ownership and real, tangible control over the brand, partnerships, and revenue is what matters here."

75,"@ExistentialEnso This article was more to the point that it isn't only those who you call ""tankies"" (which is a pretty derogatory term that I was surprised and kinda sucked to see) who are calling out the US for being war-mongering and imperialist in its response to this."
76,"@ExistentialEnso Can both not be true? Both that Russia is also engaging in imperialism and annexation, *and* that the US military-industrial complex is attempting to use this as an excuse to be imperialist and/or kick off another extended conflict now that the US has withdrawn from Afghanistan?"
