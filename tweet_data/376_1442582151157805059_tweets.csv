20,"@AswangNFT @opensea Congrats! Really happy for you. You deserve it all. Happy to have joined ""early"" on and followed the art instead of hype. Wanted something I would like to keep even if price would tank. Discord always feels like family especially when you want to escape other hype Discords."

37,@rhymeten @aswang Yeah indeed. Volume and Discord members isn't high yet. But the art just speaks for itself. Also look at the diamond hands on OS. Rather have an organic growth.

41,"I just love it to see all the new Cool Pet holders coming. All exited to start playing. Even more coming on Public mint on Wednesday. And there everyone was worried 0.5 Eth is too much.
Indeed the game music is so great and fits perfectly. Can't wait!"

66,"yo, sounds great! @rii look at this. https://t.co/561hGORqnF"
67,@iamDCinvestor I agree just had the same thought today. More and more celebrities joined NFT's. Also easier to grasp  and maybe their first entry point to crypto. Not far away from using uniswap etc. As politician I would be very cautious regulating it and thus loosing voters.
68,"@Degentraland @tommyk_eth @BoredApeYC @doodles @AzukiZen @worldofwomennft @coolcatsnft @RTFKTstudios @HAPEBEASTGANG @cryptoadzNFT You would think otherwise, if you visited the discord and townhalls.
The many contests and derivatives, which have been created. I just agree with the fact that outsiders have noticed/heard about cats recently. But this isn't a metric about strong community imho"
69,@blockmaniac 200 usd back then for a JPG was much.
70,"@blockmaniac Is it still luck if you hold through ups and downs and did 10x and more on paper without selling?
The riskier argument still has to be proven 🤔
So far it was the opposite. If you believe in longterm success of Eth, you mostly can accumulate that."

75,"@horndogdoteth @coolcatsnft Sounds great. The drop for higher tiers wasn't necessarily because of the Milk Tokenomics. I think Genie did his part on sweeping floors that's why floor went up compared to higher tiers.
So excited for them pets. 😻"
