18,"@dNFTplug @NFT_Goddess7 @psychedelic_nft This has been considered seeing C2 has already closed.

The common theory right now is PAPP isn’t going to be “apart” of the set bc it’s the mechanism needed to access the machine. 

I think he won’t make C2 officially apart of the full set until he announces C3."
19,"@NFT_Goddess7 @psychedelic_nft The Definition of a full set has not yet changed. There was an assumption that once the claim for Comp 2’s was closed, they (Volt) would update the definition but that hasn’t happen yet. So yes, the original full set still stands. 

But the dashboard accounts for all the NFTs."
