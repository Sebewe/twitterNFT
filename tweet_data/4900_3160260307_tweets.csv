33,What coins are you in? 👇
34,I’m pretty much out of btc and eth entirely and trading into alts that aren’t affected by btc/eth movement as I suspect it’ll go lower from here unless I see it break out. Those are predominantly metaverse coins $sand $mana $epik and a few meme coins $floki $kiba $et
35,Also just got $sand. Pretty confident about the future of Sandbox since so many NFT projects are buying land here and it’s just the beginning 🙌
36,Been really dipping into dex coins lately. Just bought the dip on $ET on uniswap. Getting early into projects is the key 👽 #EtherTerrestrial
