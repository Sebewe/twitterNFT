1,"(6/7) The question is no longer whether these phenomena are real or where on earth they are happening but rather when, where, and to whom will they happen next, and why, and how many more people will be impacted, and how soon?

3,"(4/7) A few weeks ago, to cite tangible examples of high inflation, extreme devaluation, and asset freezing, you had to cite little known currencies like the Turkish lira and Venezuelan bolívar, and far away foreign events (from a western perspective) like the Hong Kong protests."
4,(3/7) The scarcity derived by its limited supply disables inflation and discourages devaluation while the censorship resistance prevents centralized abuses like asset freezing.
5,"(2/7) Two of Bitcoin’s primary features are its programmed scarcity and censorship resistance, each enabled by its automation and decentralization."

15,"Others just write. I have never really written at length with pen and paper, besides a couple minutes filling a page in a morning journal, but I'm sure this is valuable for those who do it as well. At least, it's probably a good way to start spending more time with pen and paper."

29,"This is an infinitely complex objective, and it as impossible to know how I am doing at any point in time as it is to know the future, but I am the only judge. All I can do is what I think is right, and have faith that it is, though I know I will never know. That’s what faith is."
30,"For better or worse, I am obsessed with the objective of living my life in a way that I deem to be most worthwhile.

That is, importantly, “most worthwhile” by my ever-changing definition or lack thereof (instinct), not yours or anyone else’s, though they may influence mine."
31,"@m_spilim Primarily, it is hard for some including myself to go to sleep early enough (9:30 or 10ish?) to get enough hours of sleep this way (depending on what you consider enough) and if you don’t, the trade off of being up so early vs. not getting enough sleep may well not be worthwhile."
32,"One way to feel ahead of everyone around you on a daily basis is to rise before the sun.

Like forcing a smile can make you actually happy, feeling ahead in this way may get you actually ahead in others.

39,"If you really believed in decentralization, you would not be a maximalist of BTC, ETH, or any individual L1. One of the biggest negatives of centralization is that it has a single point of failure. If you have all your money in BTC, ETH or other, so do you. If it fails, you fail."

43,"Also, what does 8 hour even mean? It is important to define terms when miscommunication means many thousands of hours of life. Is it a 9 hour sleep window for ~8 hours of actual sleep or an 8 hour sleep window for ~7 hours of actual sleep (both assuming ~88% sleep efficiency)?"
44,"But, perhaps it is not. Perhaps it depends on the person. Probably, it does. Anyway I might think twice before accepting the common wisdom of 8 hours per night. You may not get anything but a trade of younger hours for older hours, if that, as that would imply lifespan extension."
45,"Of course, there are many reasons 8 hours of sleep may be better than 6 hours of sleep. If you take my logic from the first two tweets to the extreme, a 2 hour sleeper gets many more hour young but probably dies young too and feels terrible the whole time. 6 hours could be bad."
46,"Additionally, the 6 hour sleeper is taking the 8 hour sleeper's decade of hours awake from age 80 to 90 and trading them 1:1 for additional hours awake across ages 0-80 in this unrealistically clean but maybe reasonably proximate case. Most would prefer the younger hours I think."
47,"365*80*(24-6) = 365*90*(24-8)

One view on sleep: whether you sleep 6 hours a night for 80 years or 8 hours a night for 90 years, you get 525,600 hours awake. So unless sleeping 8 vs 6 adds &gt;12.5% to lifespan, or in this case 10 years (of 80), you get more hours awake sleeping 6."
48,"I think it is important during good times that we trick ourselves into believing we have to do hard things, and that we do them, lest we bring bad times upon ourselves.

67,@budries1 @ShortConsensus My understanding is that change of amendment requires 2/3 of house &amp; senate so unlikely to flip back and forth (though agree changing once makes it more likely to change again). Only *maybe* feasible now bc left hates Trump more than they like Biden and right gains odds for 2024.
68,"@budries1 @ShortConsensus Also fair. For me the idea was driven by desire to change incentives, not to block either individual. That said, I do think it is unusually feasible rn because of the immediate impact it would have blocking both from 2nd terms. So it may be good vs feasible for different reasons."
69,@ShortConsensus It certainly could. A lot of factors in play here many of which I’m sure I’ve not thought of. One counter in favor of increased variance could say that the president should be changing faster than before to match the fact that the world around them is changing faster than before.
70,"If you voted “no” above I would love to know why in comments. 

One argument against would be that a lack of regard for re-election (if it was not possible regardless) could lead a leader to act more recklessly, with less accountability to the people."

72,Would you vote in favor of this?
73,"What if @JoeBiden made it the priority of his presidency to rally the powers that be to push through an amendment to the 22nd Amendment?
