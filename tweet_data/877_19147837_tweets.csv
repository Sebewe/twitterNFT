3,"The dogs eventually triumph and save the Yacht Club, but Jimmy still needs to answer for the ethically questionable experimentation that turned our cute little puppers into blood-thirsty war machines… https://t.co/6Xs9n4EEMr"
4,It begins with Jimmy accidentally creating an army of robot monkeys that attempt to destroy the Yacht Club. To rectify the situation Jimmy then creates an army of robot dogs to help fight the battle… https://t.co/ZPOjXYQ0BL
5,My working theory—and it has some holes but whatever—is that The Trial of Jimmy the Monkey is a mutant origin story. We were airdropped/sold mutants but never really told how or why they came to be and now we’re gonna go back and explore the backstory… https://t.co/5gXBURV4dA

12,"Reazlizing that BAYC is a pfp based on great storytelling makes me even more bullish on @jenkinsthevalet, which is essentially the same thing with the same IP, just in reverse (a storytelling NFT that will become a pfp)."
13,The @BoredApeYC founders being writers has been so important to the project's success and I don't think people even realize that. The storytelling has been so creative and completely off-the-wall but extremely well-executed. I can't even imagine how much fun they've been having.

16,@Sm0keypot @JamieGeorge93 What if Jimmy accidentally created mecha mutants and the only way to stop them is to create mecha dogs? (There’s also the Jimmy robot suit parts that were airdropped from the scavenger hunt to consider.) https://t.co/NzNzl0GAAb

45,@DanielitoG25 Has anyone been priced out tho? Entry into a solid OG project at 1.2 ETH has been very fair. Rewards the people who believed in it by letting them have crazy fun and raising their floor in the process and then you can make a lower tier down the road when people are priced out.
46,What if you can merge multiple GCG species and it effectively burns those tokens but creates a new hybrid species? The hybrid species would be super rare AND it would make all the other species deflationary… 😳
