60,@0xApeMfers @LilyyAlexander3 @0xApes_NFT Oh I wonder why I couldn’t find it earlier. Maybe it wasn’t listed for sale when I was searching. Will check it again later on LR. Staying away from OS for the time being
61,"@LilyyAlexander3 @0xApeMfers @0xApes_NFT Well happy I got this mutant one, good enough for me 😁"
62,@0xApeMfers @LilyyAlexander3 @0xApes_NFT Haha it’s an expression meaning I couldn’t find it

67,"@MaritimeVintage hahaha shyt, I remember making some fan sites using that as a teenager. And playing Loom in EGA as a kid"
68,@MaritimeVintage Dear lord I remember Netscape. And what was the software to make websites again? Frontpage?
69,@CountofZurich https://t.co/jk3LCsnzHH
70,I also read that people are upset that LooksRare earned USD30 million by staking unattributed tokens? You do realise that staking rewards are based on 2% fees that is shared to ALL stakers? News flash: OpenSea shares ZERO of its 2.5% fees that it charges you.
71,@ApeStackin @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 Me too. 100%.
72,So both LooksRare and X2Y2 worked on making a better product and resolving potential vulnerabilities but the end result is a falling token price? I wonder if anyone actually understands what they’re buying. Clearly the market is driven by just FUD and FOMO
73,@srinigoes @OutlawGalsMC @OGMCSwampmaids Wow that’s fire

88,@vasa_develop https://t.co/FsAOY1uNUd
89,So I spent the morning paying gwei to revoke permissions and worrying unnecessarily about my portfolio. I just hope that FINALLY people start using LooksRare seriously rather than just an afterthought. Having options keeps you in the game

99,@negithenagi I actually list everything for sale on LR. I took advantage of the free listing too. Unfortunately people still list on LR higher than OS which is weird. I’m BEGGING for a shift but i can’t disagree that most ppl are just leeching the free money
