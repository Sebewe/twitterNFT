3,"@Swagtimus That’s how most people learn why decentralization is important—when it effects their lives, ala the GameStop moment which was huge for lots of prior crypto doubters to understand the value in self-custodying assets and in having DEXs. Also NFTs/royalties for artists."

30,@DrifterShoots Here for this
31,"@Abraham_L_L Great point. People think of decentralization as binary, and commonly label projects as either decentralized or not. It’s a spectrum and it’s certainly not just voting w tokens."
32,"@beaniemaxi @iamDCinvestor @mdudas 24 vol for BTC &amp; ETH on CB: 550M v 490M. 1.2T v 1T. BTC is often higher but trend is growing in ETHs favor. But I’m more interested in the reasoning you have for your original thesis, not nitpicking subsets of one of a few point I made to support the opposite conclusion to yours"
33,"@beaniemaxi @iamDCinvestor @mdudas In Ethereum land, yea. But vs USD, BTC still often is higher despite ETH surpassing at times. I expect that trend to continue to flip and consistently maintain over time. Btw, what’s the argument for why Ethereum/ETH can diverge in “success”?"
34,"@beaniemaxi @iamDCinvestor @mdudas ETH is trending to become the most liquid crypto, w 1559+merge economics making it not only the hardest money but most easy/accepted DeFi collateral. Adding staking’s dependence on ETH, the old argument that Ethereum can be successful w/out ETH doesn’t make much sense these days."

37,@santiagoroel I’m sure it makes sense for some if the goal is to have scarcity mechanics but including them also creates certain limitations on creativity + certain barriers to entry. Removing land scarcity can more easily lead to positive feedback loops + more players on the creative side.
38,"@kaiynne And after a year or so, if token utility/reasons to hold is still weak, what’s the incentive to stick w the protocol as opposed to dumping unlocked tokens + seeking work from the next new hot protocol who will give you the same deal (12 month cliffs + lots of tokens)?"
39,"@kaiynne Agree lock ups help force holding in the short/midterm (12-36 months), but it’s not that long of a time in grand scheme, especially for the more complex protocols that will take 6-24 months to get off their V1/alpha versions."
40,"@kaiynne It’s also important to continue finding ways to deliver longer term token utility/reasons to hold the tokens. If it’s just a race to earn/dump, what’s the incentive for a talented engineer to hold/maintain interest vs just dumping/earning coins from the next hot protocol?"
41,@sassal0x @leeminster Both BTC and ETH will have a place in crypto in the short/mid term but too many Bitcoin thought leaders are years behind on their education/understanding of what Ethereum is and where it’s at on solving its hardest problems.
42,@sassal0x @leeminster I’ve seen a lot more misinformation and uneducated takes from the Bitcoin side than I do informed critiques of Ethereum (most of the good critiques come from w/in the Ethereum community).

49,@antiprosynth @L_Nakaghini 1-2% inflation + single non-custodial utility vs indefinite negative supply + infinite utility w at least an income from trustless staking. I know which one is my reserve currency…
50,@alexgausman @forefront__ I don’t think we ever go back to the emerging DeFi days when everyone sort of had similar interests and was part of one broad/single community.
51,"@alexgausman It’s why I’m bullish on DAOs/squads in this space who have differing interests and focuses. Also, projects like @forefront__ will be key to at least stay up to date on trends you may not be completely tapped into."
52,"@alexgausman The # of communities, and the amount of people in them, will just keep accelerating/expanding into an impossible task for any single person to stay on top of (even the NFT communities are fairly complex now w differing viewpoints and goals. Many are moving beyond focus on PFP)."
53,RT @TriforceDao: 1 full year under the beacon chain's belt with 8.8M ETH staked. Here's to all the devs and stakers that made this possible…
54,"@stefdelev I’d guess that younger people were forced to multi-task/juggle between a bunch of diff stimulus at younger ages. Those will have a better ability to do it but in terms of adapting to it later/getting better at it, I wonder how long it takes + what the efficiency limits are"

57,@TeaRespecter @crypto_bunker @FroggyFrogster I don’t know her at all from other markets but at least in this one I can compare her claims against what’s actually happening w the tech to see she most likely still hasn’t thought deeply enough about Ethereum and what ETH is and does
58,@crypto_bunker @FroggyFrogster Yea I’m a bit surprised she hasn’t opened up even a little on ETH
59,@alexgausman 🤙🤙
60,"@alexgausman The names can’t be revoked by governance, but governance can implement incentives against name squatting (fees for particular behavior or something), but nothing much has really been discussed on it"
61,@FroggyFrogster @crypto_bunker She’s also shifted her arguments and critiques against Ethereum a lot since last year. Seems like with every major ETH development or milestone she changes up how she frames her pro-BTC/anti-ETH conclusion

75,"@ghost_818 @optimismPBC @arbitrum @zksync @HopProtocol @ConnextNetwork Other key pieces are things like oracles (@chainlink), funding (@gitcoin), wallets (@MetaMask, rainbow, @argent), staking (@Rocket_Pool)"
76,"@ghost_818 Other than the foundational DeFi projects, key infrastructure will be the roll up provider tokens (@optimismPBC, @arbitrum, @zksync, etc.), which then makes the cross roll up projects key infra too (@HopProtocol @ConnextNetwork etc)"
77,"@DO724 @iamDCinvestor @punkscomic @MetaHero_ I don’t think more of a chance to get cores is true (haven’t heard that before), but you will get a bonus on $POW and likely $PV if your full set is staked"
78,@iamDCinvestor @punkscomic @MetaHero_ Tho short term $POW token is going to be interesting to watch play out if PV puts out a @wolfdotgame style game w deflationary tokenomics
79,"@iamDCinvestor @punkscomic @MetaHero_ I’d probably not mint at this point. You missed the planet snapshot + w the full PV sets you’ll get more $POW and eventually $PV, which is probably going to be neck and neck on importance if you’re giga long on PV and all that it eventually creates."

87,@FroggyFrogster For real. Ethereum devs = super humble and speak mostly through their work.
