4,"Disliking a culture is not the same as disliking a race or people

For example, I dislike British lad culture—it is awful

I like people from Britain and all walks of life

I dislike cultures that encourage putting women into cloth bags

I like people from oil producing counties"

Though he has the right to make binding decisions, he in effect trades away shares of the total reputation return in exchange for others’ work.”

28,"“The simplest non-trivial case is when a project has multiple co- maintainers working under a single ‘benevolent dictator’ who owns the project. Custom favors this mode for group projects; it has been shown to work on projects as large as Linux”

65,@therishidesai I disagree. @quillchat is amazing.
66,"We began working on a mobile app called Balance Wallet

It was a beautifully designed application but was terribly engineered

We had made a terrible choice—using React Native over Swift—which slowed us down enormously and cost me financially

I was proud of the concepts we tried https://t.co/HJghda8wLH"
67,"One of our engineers, @pedrouid, came up with the idea for @WalletConnect which we decided to spin out into its own entity

This was an enormously complicated and time consuming endeavour for a microscopic startup but it was well worth it

Pedro has done a fantastic job with it https://t.co/xV72lxhkQQ"
68,"We pioneered an incredible amount of the standard interface patterns for Ethereum

Balance Manager, a web app for interacting with the protocol, helped thousands of people move hundreds of millions of dollars of value around the network

69,"I had helped out on a few of the early concepts for Ethereum and was paid in Ether

Watching this open source cryptocurrency skyrocket while my closed source indie app imploded was wild

It sucked me back into the ecosystem and we pivoted Balance to focus on Ethereum-based apps https://t.co/dWRDUJfkSi"
70,"After our successful launch on the Mac App Store, things went swiftly downhill for our beautiful little product

Intuit, a gigantic corporation that controls a lot of banking data and accounting software, pulled their data from Plaid, which ruined us

Then ETH went up 100x https://t.co/BmDh5EufYa"
