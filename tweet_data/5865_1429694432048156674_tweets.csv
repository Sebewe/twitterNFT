83,"Yes for all the Twitter bros out there all of this information I have taken from websites , I am not a on chain analyst or crypto research. Please check out their website here  https://t.co/8VqqC1Bz0n"
84,"03 / One Private Internet Login What is it? Users can access any internet website or service privately — without creating an account and handing over their personal data. Instead, they login securely with Mina. No centralized service provider can block them."
85,"02 / Permissionless Web Oracles is it? With Mina’s Snapps, developers can leverage private, verified, real world data from any website to build decentralized apps. They can input any information that is publicly available on the web (without needing that website’s permission)."
86,"01 / End-to-End Data Privacy: From Online to On-chain ~ Users can access critical on-chain services without sharing their personal data. Instead, they use Mina to access their online data and to prove that they meet the requirements of service providers."
87,"Mina is focusing on three use cases that will help us build a private gateway between the real world and crypto — and the secure, democratic future we all deserve"
88,"if more users can run nodes and validate transactions, more nodes would be created which would support the network in becoming more decentralized and secure."
89,Mina’s developers used a cryptography technique called zk-SNARKS to create a payment-oriented blockchain that does not require each node to record the complete record of historic transactions.
90,"By keeping the entire blockchain smaller than most pictures on your phone, Mina plans to overcome blockchain size issues that have plagued other projects as they grow."
91,"Another problem blockchains encounter is incorporating scalability , decentralisation and security. Many devs have found it difficult to have all three feature in the on blockchain ( solana ~ security &amp; Ethereum ~ scalability )"
92,its size is designed to remain constant despite growth in usage. This allows the blockchain to stay congestion free unlike blockchains like eth for example
93,"$MINA was rebranded from CODA protocol in 2020 and is developed as a ""light blockchain"" in order to run DApps more efficiently."
94,In a #fishyfam spaces this morning someone ( I'm very sorry I don't know who as I was making breakfast ) asked me about $MINA
