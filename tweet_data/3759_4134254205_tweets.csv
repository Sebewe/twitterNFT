25,"@TerminatusX @wolfdotgame To go further into this, imagine that sheep will produce more wool on certain parts of land. If there's no farmer the sheep will roam around at their own will, if you do have a farmer you can choose where your sheep are and in turn increase wool production. Just speculation :)"
26,"@TerminatusX @wolfdotgame The only logical thing I can think of is the farmers commanding sheep, be it the player's sheep or sheep in general in some way."
27,@AgnesDraws Happy birthday! 🎉🎉

56,@AstrophotoRoss @wolfdotgame Correct!
57,@AstrophotoRoss @wolfdotgame There is no definite end date but it will run for 60-90 days.
58,"Want to learn more about Wolf game? Here are some resources.

Alpha game whitepaper: https://t.co/5YvxjmqZTo
Community guide (created by @TerminatusX): https://t.co/4VKBSxCUOl"
59,"Once you have your $WOOL follow these steps to play:
1 - Go to https://t.co/kZl0jtMn12
2 - Connect your wallet
3 - Click the pack you want to join
4 - Scroll down and there will be a button to stake your $WOOL (beware you will have to pay gas again)
5 - Done, you're in!"
60,"$WOOL is the currency of the game and you can buy and play with any amount. You can buy $WOOL by going to the link below and swapping $ETH for it. Beware that you will have to pay gas to swap.

https://t.co/UL43gnsH5B"
61,"You can join a pack with a wolf, sheep, or $WOOL. Every place even the last place has a prize allocated to it. The prize gets spread among the pack depending on how much they have contributed. So lower-ranked packs will win less but will also have to share less."
62,"🧵Everyone can play @wolfdotgame and here is how.

At the moment there's an interim game taking place called alpha game where 14 packs are competing for $160 million. But here's the thing, everyone that plays wins."
