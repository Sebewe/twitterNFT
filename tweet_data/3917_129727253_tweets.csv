56,@acediatwt I could see NFTs allowing collaborating brands to easily collect royalties. It would allow users to sell their items on the secondary market to purchase other items or even make money (like gameflip but easier). Certain NFT items could act as a token gate for maps or game play.
57,@BillyM2k You mean like gamers that hate NFTs but will pay insane amounts of money on in game skins and bundles?
58,"@MacRendar @Balwick_ @seagategaming You claimed faked money. Yet, crypto currency is seen as a taxable. You also mentioned using it to purchase things. I’ve used crypto to purchase IRL items, including food, apparel, and tickets to events."
