This space is full of people who are afraid to speak up for themselves, especially against those who take advantage of others.

Don't support people who do bad things 🐵 https://t.co/IbfmOyot69"
90,"After multiple requests over the period of a number of weeks, they continued to ignore and divert - until I pressured them to finally answer [and pay use] on behalf of the people they were making work for free... Which left a sour taste in my mouth 🤐 https://t.co/Mw8YPlnHrI"
91,"And of course, on mint day they over prescribed their mint list to ensure selling out [typical for any project].

But, in the weeks following - they specifically ignored questions around compensation for their moderation team, despite making millions.

[redacting who posted] https://t.co/vjKbhV6MJI"
92,"It was clear they had trouble marketing, as no one else was joining the server.

For a period of about three weeks, traffic was non-existent. Which is where I believe they hooked up with @PLATOONDAO 

With the support of an marketing team, they began to skyrocket 🚀"
93,"In total, 1000+ people joined due to my exposure [between various projects I had] including their most active member.

Of course, I was glad for their success and let them handle it from that point."
94,"I joined their server in early January when they had 100 members, I loved their art.

I quickly promised them a large influx of people in exchange for a moderation position - which would guarantee myself free mints."
