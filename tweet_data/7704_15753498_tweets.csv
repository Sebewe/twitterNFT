34,@levie This has been a huge point for us building Jovie. Ensuring we don't box ourselves in with architecture. But slowing down to make the right choices is already paying off in our ability to iterate and adapt quickly without having to scrap infrastructure.
35,@mrsharma @theryanking Mostly accurate. But quality content  and engaging content are not necessarily the same thing.  We're a long way from figuring out an incentive structure that rewards quality over engagement unfortunately.  But excited to be among those working to change that.

72,3️⃣ You and your investors have liquidity from day 1.  They are not INVESTED in you for the long term.  They are incentivized to sell as soon as they make a return.  Imagine if every pre-seed investor sold at Series A?  The entire cap table flips to trend-chasers.
73,"2️⃣ The more successful it becomes, the harder it is to grow. The cost of entry is too high for most people.  So this ""web 3 democratizes access and wealth"" doesn't quite work out. Anything successful will only benefit those who connected from the start or are already wealthy."
74,"1️⃣ Every person in the DAO gets financial steak.  So the better the DAO does, the more incentive you have to sell your tokens and thus LEAVE the DAO.  You're building a community where, if it works, people leave."
