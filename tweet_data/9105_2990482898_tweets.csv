12,@iamkadense @HawksightCo @Drippies How does one go about getting an invite to @drippieverse ?
13,@NFTAYCH 🤣🤣🤣
14,@JPEGJOEY7 You deserve it man!
15,@iamkadense @HawksightCo @Drippies Nice. Also in for Hawksight. Thanks for sharing!
16,@BackpackerFI Nothing in Africa?
17,@iamkadense Any hint as to the projects you're participating in? I accept that it's nfa 😉
18,@dvoretskyi @sainteclectic @worldofsolana @CryptoGraf_Art 🤣
19,@Psych0nautiqu3 This is not ok Sonder! Whose head we gotto bash!?
20,@Cryptkoh 💯 Well said!
21,"@RegenIncorp @DappaSol Yeh I knew you weren't bragging, hence why my comment wasn't targeted at you.
You are right, many professions don't sleep long hours. Science has data to show it's not healthy. Science is facts, doesn't care about opinions. Interested to hear your thoughts when you read book."
22,"@RegenIncorp @DappaSol Of course. I wasn't referring to you directly. You weren't bragging about little sleep were you?
You're allowed an opinion. When something isn't based on fact then it is just that. I wasn't attacking you man, I hope to help by suggesting the book."
23,"@RegenIncorp Strong opinions loosely held. Love it!
If you do audio the author narrates, it's great. Or he's also done podcasts with Tim Ferriss, Peter Atria, Kevin Rose."
24,"Canvas II is going to be another level!
@CryptoGraf_Art 
Doing good things @sainteclectic https://t.co/FGHNP57sJA"
25,"@harvey__nft 
Thanks for this great poster of my @DegenApeAcademy love it! https://t.co/11KJyrzifs"
26,@NFTjordy Love it. Keep spreading good feels Jordy!
27,"@DappaSol @RegenIncorp 1000000% right!
Bragging about how little you sleep doesn't make you a hero. Makes you ignorant."
28,"@RegenIncorp You're a beautiful ape but you have no clue what you're talking about.
Go read 2 chapters of Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams https://t.co/gKQLUhi5t4
Scariest book I've read!"
29,@iamkadense 💯👏👏
30,"@DegenArmstrong @StonedApeCrew Is @StonedApeCrew the fastest growing NFT on Solana? From the day of mint, MoM growth?"
31,"@monoliff HERE WEEEEE GOOOOOOOO...
again"
32,@immortal_cory @DeGodsNFT It's not you it's them bro!
33,@day25 @NFTeams_ I've personally found the videos great. Good learning content for anyone who is interested. Also transparency is fantastic!
34,@Emekacyril147 @knox_trades @dyorapp @finndegods Gold! Thanks for sharing bro
35,@BasedGodOfPeace @BlockChainChad @DeGodsNFT @frankdegods @CozomoMedici @greg16676935420 @macdevclone @xlr8decentral @rajgokal @APackProduction @0x_fxnction @0xchillm0n @The_Sol_Army I'm selling some listings. I just need the fp to slow down a little.

37,@Cryptkoh @DeGodsNFT @FamousFoxFed @DegenApeAcademy Do it!
38,@Cryptkoh @DeGodsNFT @FamousFoxFed @DegenApeAcademy Love it man. Good truths. Put it into a thread! Thanks for sharing your thoughts
39,"@Cryptkoh @DeGodsNFT @FamousFoxFed @DegenApeAcademy 💯
The gaming piece has potential but it feels like the first games on Facebook or in the app stores. There will be thousands and most will be copies of copies and crap."
40,@NEARmaverick I'm excited!
41,@BackpackerFI If they don't like your Tweets why not unfollow and mute? People are so strange!
42,@mrdavediamond Can you share some of your favourites? What platforms (eth &amp; sol) do you look at most?
43,@Cryptkoh 💯 so what do you look for? What do you give a fck about?
44,"@theoctopusjones Agreed. Discord has a steep learning curve. The UX is terrible and it always feels like chaos, in most servers. 
It would be really helpful to select a few channels from multiple servers that you can watch/use in your own server. Remove some of the noise that way."
45,@day25 Wow thats bonkers! Wow!

50,@Stanysurfer Is it all Dutch auction to get in? Some of the comics selling really high. Love the vision. I can't afford them but maybe I'll join the Discord and participate.
51,"@TomHums 💯
Literally my Tweet yesterday.
""If we had more woman running countries things would be less shit!"""
52,@Stanysurfer Follow up.. how are you involved? Are there NFTs you own or you just follow the community?
53,@Stanysurfer Thanks for sharing Jace! Defs taking a look
54,@Sharp3X_crypto @DeGodsNFT 💯 Happened to me this week. Unintentionally. I just commented on how strong the community seemed and how I don't own one yet. BOOM! Comments and follows.
55,@tofushit888 @DeGodsNFT Man this community is pumping! DAA is strong but these DeGods are on another level. Mad unity. Has to make you bullish!
56,@CryptoSchuster @harvey__nft @DegenApeAcademy @harvey__nft take my money! How do I get my hands on one?
57,@credlessk @DeGodsNFT Thanks ser!
58,@CryptoDan82 @DeGodsNFT Grinding for it ser!

61,@Ithousand_ @frankieblanco99 @catalinawhales @DegenApeAcademy @DegenTrashPanda @SoulDogsNFT @bobosofwar @BMC_NFT @DroniesNFT @SolluminatiNFT @DeathbatsClub Interesting. Good luck!
62,Are there any photographers getting into #NFTs on #Solana? Where are they listing their work?
63,@Psych0nautiqu3 @DeGodsNFT Me too! Very salty!
64,Comment on a @DeGodsNFT tweet and get followed by 15 DeGod legends. I'm not even an owner. This community is bonkers! I start saving to get one today!
65,@DeusNero @knox_trades 🙏🙏
66,@tofushit888 @DeGodsNFT My feed is ALL @DeGodsNFT and I think I follow 2 owners. Bonkers!
67,"@frankdegods Facts!
Also if women ran most countries I'd bet things would be less shit!"
68,@Ithousand_ @frankieblanco99 @catalinawhales @DegenApeAcademy @DegenTrashPanda @SoulDogsNFT @bobosofwar @BMC_NFT @DroniesNFT @SolluminatiNFT @DeathbatsClub Se big name drops there! 👌
69,@CryptoTioSam @sainteclectic @CryptoGraf_Art @dvoretskyi Love this! Old school cartoons are the shit!
70,"@NEARmaverick Maverick, I've been building global customer Success and ops teams for startups in tech for 10+ years. DM, happy to help if I can."
71,@crypto_boomers Build global Customer Success for tech companies.
72,@mrdavediamond .sol hey? Nice one bruv
73,@NFTjordy @DegenApeAcademy I know what I wasn't doing! Buying more Apes! Dammit!
74,@DegenArmstrong @NFTjordy Damn that's clean! ❤️
75,@AuroryDaily @Bardstocks @levani_tev Nope... Just spend time figuring out how to get my hands on an Aurory.
76,@sainteclectic This is how we improve! Keep fighting mate! Love your work
77,@day25 @BYOPills Looks like a cool project. I didn't know about them. Thanks for sharing
78,"@Bardstocks @AuroryDaily @levani_tev So what's the buy, DeGods or Aurory?"
79,@monoliff https://t.co/lioCZfqxkM
80,@MR0808 May the force be with you!
81,@Babyblue7138 @DeGodsNFT Also every non-DeGod right now
82,@sainteclectic @Redkoi 🤜🤛
83,@Bardstocks https://t.co/1TILnK8H4m
84,@Bardstocks Shut up and take my money!
85,@Bardstocks Are those cake croutons in there?
86,@sainteclectic @Redkoi Not sure how I missed this when you posted it but I love it. More of this in the space!
87,"@dm2moon @DeGodsNFT What you get if you burn? For those on the outside that would love to get in, burning hurts my soul just a little."
88,I have to share the amazing work being done on the @CryptoGraf_Art training canvas. Seriously talented folks in this space. https://t.co/H2KVtr6kuJ
89,"@kevinrose Kevin, what ledger you using for NFTs? Have any improved so your NFTs are viewable as images not code?"
90,@BeetleJuiceCB @NipseyHussle @crash_minion @CryptoGraf_Art Are you serious!! This is insane behaviour. 🤯
91,"@SahilBloom Glorious.
Fucking.
Thread.
👏👏👏"
92,@NFTjordy GM ser
93,@BeetleJuiceCB @CryptoGraf_Art 👏👏👏
94,@Bardstocks @Psych0nautiqu3 @niekdetuniekde 👏👏👏
95,@AussieNftGuy What's the timing strategy on that? Projects often pump right after mint. How long would you wait to start buying? % drop? Time?
96,@GiancarloChaux 20 person marketing team. Probably moved 10 of them across from social media marketing to nft 2 months ago.
97,@REQuiemNick @NEARmaverick @King_Vicky_ This was my first thought as I skipped through. It seems like so many near projects are just going to pixel nft route. Put in some effort to raise funds for your project. It shows you are MAYBE gmi
98,"@dvoretskyi @CryptoGraf_Art @BeetleJuiceCB @BeetleJuiceCB Wow!!!
That is some serious talent! I can't wait to see what you'll do on the next live canvas. We'll clear a whole corner for you!"
99,@CryptoGraf_Art That Biggie is bananas! Do we know who did it?
