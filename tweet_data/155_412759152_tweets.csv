Hardware wallets generate your seed phrase in a secure way, disconnected from the internet or your computer. It does not store the seed phrase on the device, that's all"

39,"The NFT space is young, unsafe, and extremely vulnerable.

Always assume that you are under attack. 

Take all the safety measures, and if you are not sure about something, err on the side of caution.

Beware of what you don't know you don't know."

These guys should just stop talking. Turning bad into horrible."

95,"@OogaVerse surprised their community by saying that their next stage will not be ready for 2-3 months.
