1,"I agree with this. If there hadn’t been problems launching the game, the sentiment around cool cats would be way move favorable. This team is massively dedicated to bringing their vision to life. A true OG project that deserves a lot more love than it’s been getting lately. https://t.co/EgC99QqFXs"
2,A huge amount of project are just derivatives of derivatives these days. It makes my head spin that anyone would buy them.

8,@Evansemola It’s not their fault if someone doesn’t like dogs. They’re just wrong 🤷‍♂️
9,@TheVirtunaut @oimoigan @AbbeyRoad Wow that’s so cool!
10,"Uninformed contrarian take: 

There are definitely some bad looking @Pixelmon but most aren’t as bad as Twitter would have you believe. I don’t know much about the project but if the tech is good, this would be the time to accumulate. I don’t plan on owning any, just my thoughts."
11,"Been so excited to see more teasers on the sidekicks. @chriswahl73, do you have anything to share? 👀"
12,@TheGoodKnightGK @WonderPals Got mine too!
13,@CuriousClumsy Just mint another son 😂
14,"@TheGoodKnightGK The MAYC hoodie is so cozy. One of the most comfy articles of clothing I own, easily. (I also no longer own a MAYC)"
15,"@iJmillz Very sorry to hear that man. You’re one of the few photographers in the world that makes me feel things the way your work does. I think you’re making the right call. I wish you all the best. Hmu if you’re ever in Seattle, lunch on me."

21,There’s almost no traffic today. I think it’s because of Elden Ring.

37,RT @boredapewood: Welcome to crypto twitter - where every green day is full euphoric bull and every red day is a multi year bear market
38,@boredapewood This should be pinned lol
39,Cool pets refusing to go under 2 eth in these uncertain market conditions makes me think there’s a lot of support and belief from the majority of holders. Bullish.
40,"@the_good_knight Goodnight, Good Knight 💤🌙"
41,@JamesNFT_ how dare they fud the cats lol

46,@la_da_kid @wenmilk_eth Gs move in silence like lasagna.
47,"@frankiebuys I think we should judge them on the product and not the challenges that got in the way. If anything, I’m more bullish on the cool cats team because I know when the going gets tough, they won’t give up. They’ll have opportunities in the future to show they have learned from this."

51,"@TheRickHerr @coolcatsnft Damn that seems a little harsh. I’d be buying them in that range if they went that far down, I’m sure many others would too. We’ll have to see."
52,@steven_schill Ponzu scheme? Sounds delicious.
53,"Massive shoutout to everyone involved with the project. This has probably been the most challenging month for the cats, keep up the good work and stay positive!"
54,"Might be the last time to buy @coolcatsnft under 10 eth. People are justifiably frustrated by the delays this month, but if the game nails it (which I think it will), it could be the biggest defi game of all time. I believe in this project, I know the team has our backs. W❤️TC"
55,"@coolcatsnft I believe in you cool cats team! I see how hard you’re all working, home stretch. So excited to see the fruits of your labor blow everyone’s minds."
56,I just paid my rent thanks to @the_x2y2

60,@tmagled Took a long ass time to announce the winners too. Entries for this drawing started in October iirc. A lot of reasons to doubt the project lately but I truly think they’ll pull through.
61,@GershyMoskowits Fake account. Don’t fuck with this.
62,"@cmurda_eth @the_x2y2 I expect the token price to go lower. Sold my airdrops, gonna continue to watch though. Sentiment around launch is too poor to hold. I’ll take my free money and see how it shakes out."

65,"@MarketWizard94 Just guessing here but I'm assuming fully diluted MC based on a 150m total supply would currently put it at about $369m. Seems like most people are going to immediately sell. If it were to down by 75% from here, it would put it at ~$92m or about $0.60."

85,@LooksRareNFT @Trezor Thanks for the update
86,@coolcatsnft Was this recorded? I missed it.
87,@PuffYatty No but I read you loud and clear
88,@cr0ssETH @coolcatsnft I think @andrwwang’s cat laid this one https://t.co/JTtenEVRaD
89,@CLemm_31 @pixelvault_ @Gfunkera86 Wise choice. Welcome. 🤝
90,@cmurda_eth I like when POW when it goes up because it’s worth more. I like POW when it goes down because I can buy more.
91,@parabholic @PuffYatty It’s not going to be a typical reveal. The pets will end up looking different based on items they are fed in the game. They’ll be revealed as each pet owner plays the game at whatever pace they can afford (you buy the in game items to feed your pets with the $MILK token).
92,@parabholic @PuffYatty Lowest I’ve seen anyone pick one up is 1.7. Hard to say if an untouched egg will be more valuable over time but it seems likely.
93,@DRiveraTX Shit I forgot about the town hall
94,"@parabholic @PuffYatty They’re a core element of the game. Arguably more important than the cats. If the game succeeds the way I think it will, fully hatched and upgraded pets could be worth 5-10 eth based on aesthetic."
95,"The @coolcatsnft game has some of the highest potential in the space imo. There’s a lot of doubt in the short term but if people start making serious money off of owning cats or pets, it could blow up in a way we’ve never seen. Its lead by a great team despite the recent hurdles."
