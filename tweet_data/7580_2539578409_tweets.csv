Je savais pas pour le CBDC €, l'UE tombe vraiment dans tout les pièges à con ! Tu as des liens ?"
12,"Why China?

Because they have a strong need to establish their currency as a standard.

The gov have been stockpiling humongous amount of gold

It would be a great currency for international trades

13,"Since a few years I have a theory that China will ""reset"" the world economy by introducing a CBDC Yuan backed by and redeemable against gold.

My understanding was that during the wormhole incident the underlying ETH backing ETH on Solana got drained

Yet Solana ETH could still be bridged to other chains / to Ethereum?

81,"It's alright to bridge 2 quite safe chains together. Issues arise when you bridge an HQ chain like #Ethereum to a shit show like #BSC or #Solana

Many/all bridges emit IOUs + depend on a wallet/multisig with weak opsec to secure the underlying...

🔮Who knows how this ends?"
82,"Of course, all chains wanna bridge to #Ethereum for the value they draw from it.

Yet, with the current main model for bridge (IOU), the risks are NOT properly segregated as demonstrated with the Solana Worhmhole debacle

The more we connect the chains, the more we mutualize risk"
