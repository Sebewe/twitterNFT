20,"In 2022, give a giant middle finger salute to the trend of closed discords and pre-defined list only mints. It's halting the progress of web3. If we don't stop it now we will pay the price later. They are attempting to centralize by doing this. #NFTs #opensea #web3"
21,Inclusion goes hand in hand with community. Seclusion does not. So why do so many projects now opt for closed discords and presale list only mints? Obviously to control their market and do something illegal they can't do with typical FIAT - groom/brainwash their target audience.
