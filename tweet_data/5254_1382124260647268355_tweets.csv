In a year or two you might get your wish when we really start contending, but at least appreciate the man for what he's done."
38,"@Italiag777 @Meloleague @rodboone I didn't say anything about JB just now. It was the entire coaching staff. 

You're the one constantly trashing him. He's living rent free in your head and it's hilarious.
