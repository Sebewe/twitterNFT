Is the price sustainable? How does $MILK even work? 

🧵👇"
11,@ZeroJeff Agreed and that was all on the team. AXS cost to breed shouldn't have been raised like that.
12,"@ape3593 Yep, the tokenomics and game theory are great. I'm just surprised by the price."

15,"Not sure why people are buying $MILK at $0.15 right now. At that price, it costs $6,750 to reveal a Cool Pet. It's a game token and not something to speculate on IMO.

My fair price estimate is approx. $0.02-0.03."
