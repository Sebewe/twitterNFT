Web3 actions speak louder than words! 

@reli3fxyz team has done an outstanding job! In 30 seconds over $1M raised and numbers keep going up from royalties.

I missed the mint, but got @baeige1 and @ItsAdamtastic pieces from the secondary to support the cause! https://t.co/Awu838TL5x"
72,"@julienontech @krybharat If you want to support the cause, I believe that the best bet is @reli3fxyz project by @andrwwang @sxtvik @giovannigussen @aljaparis @SignorCrypto 

Mint raised over 1M$ and secondary royalties also go to support causes!"
