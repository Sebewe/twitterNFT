59,@FFVV1211 @DegenToonz Are they partnered with essentials ? I saw one of their hoodies on the properties ? If so this is huge lol.
60,@jpegplug I hope this isn’t real lol. If so this is the rug of 2022 for sure.
61,@seph_nft @CoolmanUniverse ✊
62,@Lawd50 @CoolmanUniverse Same. Incredible.
63,@BillianosW @CoolmanUniverse I got what I could. Unfortunately I don’t have a donut world. I just have Wall Street. I am hoping to cop one of each now.
64,@tylerwho_ @CoolmanUniverse It’s strait 🔥🔥😂
65,@KnasenNFT @StarcatchersNFT @Beutrec @ethmaurice @Kamedez @RovyETH Well said. https://t.co/MLNoaxozlM
66,"RT @KnasenNFT: 1/ Why @StarcatchersNFT is a blue chip in the making 🧵

Starcatchers is a art based NFT by @Beutrec and ran with @ethmaurice…"
67,@TIMUS_NFT @ApeStackin I don’t know how he can walk into a room with how big his balls are.
68,@Kamedez That is straight heat right there.
69,@__chidz__ Forgot all about the yetis.
70,@Good__Gato @StarcatchersNFT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
71,"@EtheriaChan That’s roughly $69,999,950 profit. Not bad."
72,@1Goal1Dream @StarcatchersNFT This is sooooo sick. Congrats !
73,@fucking_alfa They kind of succeeded.
74,@ottothepoolboy @GutterCatGang @BoredApeYC @CoolmanUniverse @alienfrens @3landersNFT I’d honestly look at @CoolmanUniverse if you haven’t yet. Crocs announcement is coming and the founder was a brand way before nfts and has a huge following.
75,Im pretty close to integrating. @StarcatchersNFT #NFTs

78,@__chidz__ He looks pretty bored tbh
79,@itstylersays @sxtvik FR. This was incredible. I wasn’t even mad that I couldn’t mint. You guys came together in like 15 hours to put a project with some of the most well respected names in the space to benefit Ukraine.I don’t even understand the thought process on criticizing this.
80,RT @ppmctweets: The jealous egg hatcher https://t.co/3Pp48QQwsE
81,@GemmaSm41116933 ✊
82,@GemmaSm41116933 Yeah you cant say you are in this one for the art lol.
83,@ottothepoolboy @GutterCatGang @BoredApeYC @CoolmanUniverse @alienfrens @3landersNFT I think it because of the artist  and the fact that a lot of well known / big wallets are pushing it. I don't like the art as much as some other projects but in terms of capacity to pump I think its up there.
84,@GemmaSm41116933 NGL when I saw the squirtle thing I shot my drink out my nose and almost died laughing. This is either going to be in NFT lore or one of the greatest rugs of all time.
85,@GemmaSm41116933 This is both the greatest and worst thing I have seen.
86,"@ottothepoolboy @GutterCatGang @BoredApeYC @CoolmanUniverse @alienfrens Ah okay. Yeah I’d probably look at the 1-3 Eth plays to get a good multiple. I think @CoolmanUniverse , @alienfrens , @3landersNFT are good plays."
87,@Web3Adam @RealSupDucks @CoolmanUniverse You GMI fren.
88,@magnoliamegan_ We’re you around for cryptoadz?  It’s all about the vibe.
89,@JeeniusETH Yes.
90,@ASvanevik Buy @reli3fxyz off secondary. They moving funds to help Ukraine with proceeds. Great project.
91,@aezakmi_eth @ASvanevik No joke I love hearing y’all kicking ass. May not seem like it but there are people out there pulling for y’all. Stay strong peng fam !
92,@ottothepoolboy @GutterCatGang @BoredApeYC @CoolmanUniverse @alienfrens If you looking to flip that’s the play imo. If it’s long term value mutant is probably the play.
93,@ottothepoolboy @GutterCatGang @BoredApeYC You looked at @CoolmanUniverse or @alienfrens ? You could stack these for a higher multiple. CM I think will run soon with crocs announcement and frens dropping token and mutants.
94,@cryptjoe9 @LazyLionsNFT @SappySealsNFT It’s not only about the community. Several projects have incredibly strong communities in the 1-2 Eth range. @alienfrens and @CoolmanUniverse gets you access to WL like crazy and are equally affordable. CM is poised to make a crazy run. @SappySealsNFT are legit long term though.
95,@BigSexyBartolo @StarcatchersNFT Welcome ! That is sooooo clean. https://t.co/8oHljAn287
96,"@ottothepoolboy @GutterCatGang @BoredApeYC If the token kills it the mutant price will rise quickly then you can flip , sell token and buy a legit set."
97,@ottothepoolboy @GutterCatGang @BoredApeYC Between the two probably mutant until the coin drops then flip into a GcG set
98,Who else copped the @CoolmanUniverse merch ?
99,@cryptjoe9 It’s for the culture at this point.
