31,"@MadYakK I don’t consider MAYC a derivative of BAYC, I consider it a sister project or BAYC

50,"Let me reword this 

I’m rooting for @0x_GCG, it’s great advertisement for the authentic Gutter

Just like when a right click saver posts about their jpeg; it only makes the real NFT more valuable

But, I would never in a million years buy into this type of derivative https://t.co/mV07JX2VzS"
