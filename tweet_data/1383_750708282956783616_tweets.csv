82,@coinbase  just had everyone in America scrambling for their phones lol got to love it. Good job outa you guys…that was a good one
83,@John_ACW @Blindfreddie_ @crypto888crypto My guess is Gala priced it initially and 888 and BT went along with it...all of gala's nfts these days are like this...its gross and the only reason why they get away with it is because their die hard community continues to buy them up at exhorbinate prices.
84,"@lyndoco_nft @GunnarMagnusArt @just1n_eth All I am saying is that if Gala wants to succeed in gaining traction with non-crypto native gamers, pouring money into developers and releasing NFTs for said games that give power advantages at ridiculous prices is not how you go about it imho."
85,"@lyndoco_nft @GunnarMagnusArt @just1n_eth Upcoming and not yet implemented. Will believe it when I see it implemented.  And again, why are people really playing…for most, it’s not cause they are having immense fun…I can promise you that.  And yes I am very interested in seeing how things play out"
86,"@lyndoco_nft @just1n_eth The other thing is almost all of these games are play 2 earn as opposed to play and earn.  If they continue to sell power which they appear to be doing in every game they have released NFTs for thus far, they are DOA to a broader non-crypto gaming audience."
87,@lyndoco_nft @GunnarMagnusArt @just1n_eth I’d argue not many are actually playing townstar for its cutting edge game play or cause it’s fun. Will be interesting to see who is still playing 6 months from now when $town is 90% lower than where it is today.
88,"@just1n_eth Honestly, most of gala’s NFTs are like this these days. Skins, land, etc at ridiculous prices for games that haven’t even shown true gameplay yet. But as long as their community continues to buy them out each time, they will continue setting the prices like this, etc"
