21,Great thread about @CROAKZ_ ! https://t.co/qBfem3N6BB
22,@danielgothits I said $250 but it depends on the company too for me. Some companies I know aren’t worth dealing with
23,@SiftNFT @Hans_2024 @jaggedsoft @CROAKZ_ Also very easy to use them for memes as @Bicolor6990 has shown!
24,@SiftNFT @Hans_2024 @jaggedsoft @CROAKZ_ Personally love them! Art is amazing and they put a smile on my face when I see them in my wallet. Also team is really down to earth but exploring many opportunities such as the “meat space” and “bogverse”. Definitely a sleeper and I want to pickup more soon 🙏
