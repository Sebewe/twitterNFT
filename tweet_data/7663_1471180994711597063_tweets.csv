1,@nftrancher Feel free to DM me.
2,@nftrancher I’ve done some spaces/AMAs on topics like this but never really 1 on 1 without being fully retained.
3,"@nftrancher @jmt_nft @TaxmanNFT @AskForTaxAdvice @CryptoTaxGirl Yea gas to purchase, even gas for p2e games all increases your basis. Think of gas like attorneys fees for closing on a piece of real estate. 

Gas for p2e and staking are like improvements to that property which increase the value so are expenses that increase basis."
4,"It’s that time of the year. Thanks to Censored Art and @muratpak for helping me convey the message.

5,"9/ The point is crypto is not like other assets. If they are not securities, we cant just lump them into a default definition of ""property"" as that creates further issues. So if anything this is a step towards crypto becoming its own class of asset with independent tax treatment."
6,"8/ So now the IRS needs to defend their position by preventing loopholes from being created in areas where they probably never thought they would have potential issues. And that is where the victory is. Even if the IRS wins against the Jarrett's, a bigger point has been made."
7,"7/ See the Jarrett's did not create their Tezos reward, they merely provided the property to do so. This will take some guidance and an official ruling/publication by the IRS to provide clarity. If crypto was treated more as a security, this wouldnt even be a question."
8,"6/ That is where the argument is a bit weak. The IRS can easily argue that the Jarrett's were the recipient of increased value, not the creator. Using the sculpture example, the Jarrett's merely gave Michelangelo a giant rock, and he gave them back David."
9,"5/ These actions have to be looked as crypto is property and not currency. When a Taxpayer ""creates"" property, there is no taxable event until the property is sold. That is like an artist making a sculpture. The Jarrett's are arguing they ""created"" these staking rewards."
10,"4/ The argument is that by staking Tezos, the Taxpayers direct action lead to rewards. So are the receipt of these rewards taxable? The Jarrett's say no. I feel that this is actually the first case where the IRS blanket statement of ""crypto is property"" comes back to bite them."
11,"3/ Instead of contesting the denied return out of court (which would have been the easier/cheaper option), the Jarrett's filed in District Court to force the IRS to make an official ruling on this matter. Please read the Court Order for yourself:

12,"2/ First let's break down what is actually happening. The Jarrett's have made a claim for refund for taxes paid on staking rewards. Its likely an amended tax return was filed showing a reduced tax, which the IRS likely denied.  In response, the Jarrett's likely filed this claim."
13,"1/ There's been a lot of buzz about the following  news.  Here's my two cents on how a ruling like this could go in court.

https://t.co/uAHa94vper

The following thread is not legal advice, just my take as someone in the space:"
14,"This 💯 

I see it all the time with projects moving their earnings into a community wallet and focusing solely on the next phase. 

Please don’t forget that your NFT project is a business! It is responsible in the same way all other businesses have tax obligations. https://t.co/cAc2DhsVKw"
15,"@nftrancher @CryptoTaxGirl @AskForTaxAdvice 2/ So the tax you pay on the sale of 1 WOW doesn’t really affect potential gain from the sale of the other. So other than sentiment towards a particular project, if you want to realize profit, you will always be better off selling."
16,"@nftrancher @CryptoTaxGirl @AskForTaxAdvice 1/ I agree with the sentiment here, however  since each NFT is an individual piece of property, you can’t really combine/average proceeds in a particular project to offset gain. Your comparison distorts that view. Instead imagine buying two rental properties from the same builder"
17,@LordDuma Claim and stake. Break even for interest in an upcoming marketplace isn’t bad.
18,"@Danny_one_ @LordDuma Tokens are definitely a tricky subject as they arent valued the same as airdrops. In p2e games the line is even more blurred. 

However think of all the mobile games where you can farm gold, gems, etc. These are not taxed as assets since they only have value within the game."
19,Please comment to let me know which of these topics are worth expanding on. Other than the obvious answer of “all of them.”
20,"Simple reminder that the IRS has released **ZERO* guidance on tokens from p2e NFTs. 

They have released some info on airdrops. 

This is the best available source of guidance from the IRS. Please use the help of a professional to interpret.

21,@TreesAreCool12 That’s how I prefer people dream about me.
22,"More tax talks… soon. Had to make it through year end. 

From here forward its crypto tax boot camp."
23,@entillodon @SpottieWiFi Can DM me n we can talk
24,"RT @FurballsNFT: Furballs alpha team is on fire! 🔥Shout-out to 
@isoroomnft for hooking up Fur Fam with 3 WL spots for our Twitter follower…"
25,"RT @NotablesCo: Our good friends over at @HillbilliesNFT are about to begin their public mint at 8PM EST🎉

How many are you going to mint??…"
26,@blok2chainz @sickpencil @colaito7 @NFHeroes Guess my threads aren’t long enough 🤷🏻‍♂️
27,@TheGualla $ALFA
28,@CODENAME883 Absolutely. But with each option it’s also good to know the consequences
29,@TxBlokChainLaw Yea it’s definitely a fine line. Appreciate it!
30,@franki_eth @CoinLedger I have a much better idea. Lol
31,"8/ and finally
3) another downside of wash sales is the fact you’re reducing your basis in the asset by recognizing the loss. So when you sell it in the future you will have more gains."
32,7/ This could prevent you from classifying your crypto as long term capital assets and thus you’d be missing out on the more favorable capital gains tax rate. In many instances you could pay 20% more in taxes. So those recognized losses better be worth it.
33,"6/ But more importantly..

2) When you sell your crypto you are resetting the holding period. When you hold an asset for less than a year, gains are taxed as ordinary income. Wash sales set your holding period back to zero."
34,"5/ So why not sell your crypto to recognize losses and buy it back immediately? Three reasons:

1) You are banking that the IRS isn’t going to retroactively prohibit the sale as it applies to crypto. Audit risk is high in this space getting away with the loss isn’t guaranteed"
35,"4/ Th IRS change makes it more uncertain for investors to get their assets back as the same price as the proceeds from their sale. 

People are now discussing wash sales because the limitation rules only apply to securities. As we know, crypto is property. Not a security."
36,"3/ However, the IRS disallowed wash sale losses for securities if the asset was repurchased within 30 days. 

See: https://t.co/rgZj25emMA"
37,2/ First what is a wash sale? It occurs when an investor is holding an asset (typically a security) that has an unrealized loss. The investor then sells the asset at a loss and immediately buys it back. This allows them to keep their asset and recognize the loss.
38,"1/ Short-ish thread on Wash Sales:

Big concept floating around year end for crypto currencies (not NFTs since they are illiquid) is this idea that crypto currency is currently not subject to the wash sale rules. Here’s why it still may not be the best idea."
39,GM frens! 8 days left in the year. Plan wisely
40,"@ADegenerateSol Technically speaking, OpenSea is just a marketplace. So even if a project gets pulled from the marketplace, you still own the asset. 

Now does it reduce its value? Probably, but you’d have to find a way to sell it in order to recognize the loss."

Part Sale/Part Gift Transactions: https://t.co/M19RoSwgVO"
44,"3/ If you sell to someone for less than fair market value then that transaction can be considered a part sale/part gift.  This means that while you are selling an asset, the difference between sale price and fair market value is a gift. This disallows the loss as well."
45,"2/ The main way the IRS can disallow the loss is by claiming a related party transaction. See IRC 267

Selling to yourself is automatically disallowed. If your follow up question is “How will the IRS know?” Then you’re considering fraudulent reporting. 👎"
46,"1/ Common question:

Can I sell an NFT to another wallet I own or my friends wallet in order to recognize a loss?

The reality is that whenever you “sell” an asset to yourself or a friend at a discounted price, the IRS can potentially disallow the loss."
47,@_smtd_ Transferring to yourself in another wallet isn’t really considered a “sale” so you wouldn’t be able to realize and gain/loss.
48,IRS wants to know… did you buy/sell crypto in 2021? https://t.co/a5DhagEbAk
49,"Here’s the main source of guidance from the IRS regarding cryptocurrency. The main takeaway is that all virtual currency and NFTs are considered property. They are not nor should ever be considered securities.
