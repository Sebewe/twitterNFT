51,"If you read all of this and are still hating, I honestly don't know what to say.

I'm looking at you like people who prefered to write on paper rather than type on the internet. 

Enjoy being poor and being apart of the past.

Everyone getting in rn, is thanking me for this post."
52,"It reminds me of knowing BTC pre 2018*** when you were on the ride up from like under 1k to 60k.

Also, NFTs literally provide oppurtunity. As a creator, you can put your whole life's work into an NFT and have a timeline of events. You can map out your literal life and market it."
53,"And guess what? The early internet had plenty of scams and websites that did not make it as full-fledged businesses. 

Get over it, you should be on your KNEES thanking the world that you have this fucking oppurtunity. It reminds me of knowing BTC before $60k, you were chosen."
54,"Yes there are a lot of Scams right now but thats where our education comes in to understand what to avoid.

I guarantee you in under 10 years everybody will be driving electric vehicles only and owning an NFT. People do not see that we are transitioning into a full digital era."
55,"It makes no sense to be hating on an amazing technological advancement that could literally change your life like the internet did for most.

Stop hating, do your research, make $$ and realize how lucky you are that you exist in the digital age which creates more $$ than ever..."
56,"It's about owning something unique that can never be taken away from you. If you don't get the concept of ownership than of course NFTs just sound like ""hyperlinks"" but this cannot be farther from the truth.

As for ETH, eco-friendly alternatives ALREADY exist (MATIC, XRP, SOL)."
57,"RT this thread if you know someone who *HATES* NFTs.

This is for them. 

NFTs are not bad for the environment. 

It is dependant on the blockchain these unique ""tokens"" are held on. The token doesn't just have to be a jpeg, it can be anything. One day they could be house deeds."
58,You can't cure stupidity.

Me: Laughs at you while I'm sitting on bricks of cash as you're stuck in poverty when you could've been liberated from a jpeg but you're too stuck up to even understand what a fucking blockchain even is."
