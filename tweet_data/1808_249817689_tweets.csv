21,"@Chefff69 @the_x2y2 @LooksRareNFT @opensea Do you even know what the word ""tokenomics"" means? smh"
22,"@0xstink @the_x2y2 @LooksRareNFT @opensea It costs me $5-10 to approve each collection to sell on X2. I make about 1/3 of a coin per day per NFT listed. So with my 69 Mistletoadz for example I earn about 25 $X2Y2 per day. Good deal, right? But 1/3 coin is just the start. That goes up the closer I price them to the floor."
23,@panyero96 @Fractal_Visions @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea For staking I mean
24,"@panyero96 @Fractal_Visions @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea Actually that's the main reason I moved to X2Y2
The APR is about 10X higher than $LOOKS"
25,@panyero96 @Fractal_Visions @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea That's kinda how I see it too. WGMI
26,@panyero96 @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea But it was LooksRare that was not hiding invalid WETH offers. At least for the first month or so. Maybe they fixed it by now.
27,@panyero96 @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea We couldn't even sort listings from lowest to highest price for the first two weeks on LooksRare. Not sure I would call that lightspeed innovation.
28,@Blainetrain83 @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2 @opensea Also true.. Better UI for sure.
29,"Why I moved my @LooksRareNFT position to @the_x2y2 

-LooksRare trading rewards just a marketing stunt

-Why Amazon is best... (same goes for @opensea)
1. MOST LISTINGS
2. CHEAPEST PRICES

-X2Y2 listing rewards mathematically create more and cheaper listings
