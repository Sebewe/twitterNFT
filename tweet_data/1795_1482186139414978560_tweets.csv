0,There’s something new and exciting going on in the NFT space every single day it’s actually crazy
1,nvm https://t.co/zoRthqiNUq
2,Looks like my buy on Eth is paying off 🥳
3,Just bought more https://t.co/plyanYwQv2
4,can the devs do something?
5,@EarthxNft Gas prices too high
6,"Bold prediction: Crypto rallies after the fed meeting this week. Not saying It won't go down later, but a relief rally is bound to be coming. Buying now to enjoy the small bump"
7,"@TylerPa45477129 That would be insane, but I think given the already big drawdown it's okay to start dollar cost averaging in"
8,"@maikan_dubois Might be a bit overdone for now, expecting a small bounce or a relief rally. Ultimately no end in sight for the drawdown until macro economic conditions become better"
9,Bought some eth here couldn't resist
10,Literally praying eth sees 2k in a bit. Joke of a price
11,"eth down and nft volume down with it, gas has been spiking hard lately. Uniswap probably the biggest cause of this"
12,@hudbucket haha trying not to think about it too much 😅
13,gn everyone
14,Still need to see 1 final flush before we can call any sort of bottom.
15,like this tweet for absolutely no reason at all
16,"Just sit back and watch the show, couple years from now this’ll all be irrelevant"
17,"@pjmuneath yup!! I’m rooting for lower prices tbh, generational buying opportunity"
18,Still mega bullish on NFTs tho
19,"I think it’s clear by now that crypto is the future. I strongly believe eth will play a major role in all of this, so price is irrelevant now. I’d bet 2022 becomes the year where everyone says “How did i not buy the dip in 2022”"
20,This one day candle on #bitcoin is just crazy
21,Oh how dumb i feel for selling my $LOOKS
22,"#btc holding down this level pretty well. If today's daily candle is green, then I'd feel pretty confident calling the bottom here. https://t.co/qQjKNZIvrw"
