7,"I'm curious how this balances with buyside incentives. I'm sure you'd see some arbitrage with competitor marketplaces, and there's some incentivization from X2Y2 staking rewards to utilize the platform."
8,"@the_x2y2 @opensea @LooksRareNFT One interesting bit from detailed tokenomics... 65% staking rewards are split between NFT staking and $X2Y2 staking. NFT staking = listing NFTs in their marketplace (w a probability formula). So there's incentivization for sellside activity.
