5,"Invisible friends and Putin.....1,2 punch knockout"
6,@redbeardnft Might need a parachute for this moonshot though LFG!!!!!!!!
7,@redbeardnft I wouldn’t say dead but definitely overhyped and lots of dumb money floating around…that usually spells disaster but what do i know. I’m just another dumb mfer.
8,@redbeardnft This isn’t conviction this is fact…..Them shit didn’t even reveal yet and mfers are paying 10+ ETH…..We are about to implode
9,@redbeardnft I just miss the old days…..This market is dumb
10,"@BabeTruth Yea me too for not getting a WL spot, but this is a secondary fire you don’t want to be a part of atm imo. Just observing"
11,"@redbeardnft I’ll wait for 3-5 next week after some other hype mint comes out to drain the market.. This wasn’t how it used to be B…..BAYC was 1, 2 &amp; 3 before it got to 100.. This shit if fucked"
12,@BabeTruth Love the collection but this shit is dumb
13,RT @rexwub: invisible friends made my wallet go invisible
14,@zscuffed Everyday sir
15,We won’t have a balanced market until ppl start to buy what they like instead of dynamaxing on every hype train
16,Invisible Friends 7.25 ETH by the morning. Ya’ll are crazy
17,@0x_fxnction Invisible mfers sir
18,@MoshiMochiNFT Tough choice…I lean tiger though
19,@rexwub every month or two there's a hype project that nukes the market. Than we come back until the next one - When will we learn ?
