AC had a super hardcore niche fanbase but never really made sense to most people.

It feels like Starcruiser will follow the same path, with dwindling returns as the niche dries up.

AC was $25 for PI + $6 for a Kungaloosh. Not $6K."
1,"He also did something brilliant here that even Disney’s own marketing didn’t achieve…

He wrote the high price of the Starcruiser experience into the story. Scoffing at, like the rest of us. But giving us story motivation to say “Fine. I’ll pay. I have no choice. It’s worth it.”"
2,"Mike Celestino has embodied an original character for his upcoming Galactic Starcruiser voyage and shot a short film to introduce his story.

This is amazing – and makes him the geekiest person I know. Which is awesome.

3,"Experiences are the future of entertainment. People want to interact and engage, not just sit and watch. But they want to do it on their own terms, not because they were told to.

Organic engagement is the ultimate sign of a successful experience.

And it's so fun when it works."
4,"It's so much more fun to have that community and discussion surrounding each new nugget of info than it is to just have it all dumped at once.

The bigger experience surrounding the entertainment is rapidly rising to be better than the entertainment itself, for the biggest fans."
5,"Naturally, this is only true of the niche / hardcore audience.

It's this audience that craves more. To not just get excited about SEEING a world of fiction, but to actually feel like they are part of it.

The trickle of movie marketing feels like the story is told in realtime."
6,"This is fascinating.

My take: Watching movies is a passive activity. The marketing process is active engagement.

It's become more fun to interact with the experience of marketing than it is to see the final product being promoted.

Marketing IS the product. https://t.co/EmIlogovzD"
7,@KJKnies Thanks. Maybe I can find a used one!

9,Sigh. Flood of bots again. I should have learned from last time. DMs are now off. Just @ me.
10,"Themed entertainment illustrator friends - We are in need of a good concept artist to knock out a few sketches.

DM me your rates and portfolio!"
11,@tomcat335 ...better!
12,"@rheinwaldjones These are great thoughts. The challenge is that I want to keep the high resolution for modern gaming. The A1U displays are capable of 1280x960 HD resolution, so RCA won't cut it, as that'll push it down to SD.

I know – it's an annoying, dumb challenge."
13,"@rheinwaldjones Really geeky. I've modded my Arcade1Up machine to my Xbox One and Nintendo Switch so I can play console exclusives on the arcade cab. But aside from classic ports, modern 16:9 games don't offer a 4:3 letterbox setting for use on classic displays. It just squishes it."
14,@tomcat335 That seems like what I'm looking for... but wow pricey. This is just for a hobby project. That device alone would be worth more than the whole project. :)
15,"Anyone know of a device that can letterbox an HDMI signal? That is, take in a 16:9 HD signal and convert it to 4:3 letterboxed?

...or a hacky way to accomplish this if a single device doesn't exist?

Trying to make 16:9 content retain the correct aspect ratio on a 4:3 display."
16,"@thacher @kathrynyu Thank you for pushing this industry forward!

We absolutely need experimental, undefinable experiences on a massive scale like this to show the world the infinite potential of “immersive.”

The world has felt so small for so many years. Now we can all reach the stars, together."

18,@RobyMB @GoAwayGreen @WaltsFrzenHead @heybrucewright @n8creative @Make_It_Cool Pretty sure “Chamber of” anything is automatically cool.
19,"@funkpwer @JennyENicholson Yep, inevitably this WILL spawn strategy groups online, sharing every choice they made to optimize an ideal “touring plan” to see all the best scenes and have the best interactions.

Those that don’t know those tricks will be shut out of any capacity-limited moments."
20,"@PatrickSKling @Attractions There is no greater proof of the Experience Economy than the Galactic Starcruiser.

If it sustains, this shatters the ceiling of what experiential offerings can charge - as long as the production value backs it up.

And I thought Sleep No More was pricey at $140…"
21,"It’s pretty incredible to see immersive concepts I’ve loved - and even helped create in our own small scale productions - get such such widespread attention and praise.

A whole new world of immersive entertainment is here - and it’s only going to get bigger and more exciting. https://t.co/JsrliS7OCB"
22,"@WaltsFrzenHead @heybrucewright @GoAwayGreen @n8creative @Make_It_Cool Yeah, I don't like puzzles either. I love the themed environments, story, effects, and interactions of escape rooms... but just wish the puzzles didn't exist.

And hardcore escape roomers are INTENSE. I can't compete. I just stand in a corner and watch the madness ensue."
23,@heybrucewright @GoAwayGreen @n8creative @Make_It_Cool ...though there is definitely a market for immersive horror bondage dungeons too.
24,@ExpThemePark Long term contracts with regular hours and guaranteed performances are gold for actors.
25,@GoAwayGreen @n8creative @Make_It_Cool So what made you finally do one?
26,"@n8creative @GoAwayGreen @Make_It_Cool This is a great point.

Stepping outside our industry bubble – it's why people are comparing Galactic Starcruiser to murder mystery dinner theater, even though that's such a tired, dated concept.

There are MUCH better comparisons – but most people don't know about them."
27,"@GoAwayGreen @bioreconstruct We've been producing immersive theatrical experiences in Orlando that are structurally similar to Galactic Starcruiser since 2015. But it takes the power of Disney/Star Wars to popularize the format.

(Some of Starcruiser's Imagineers did attend our productions...)"
28,"@GoAwayGreen @bioreconstruct Disney is fantastic at watching the landscape of entertainment, hospitality, and retail, then picking out the elements that are intriguing and putting their incredible resources behind it, transforming it."
29,"@GoAwayGreen @bioreconstruct That's really the key. This is the first time a major LBE company has leveraged world-class IP into the modern-day immersive space.

And of course it's Disney.

The entire industry's history traces back to the opening of Disneyland: https://t.co/BDEaeUVFPW (page 10)"
30,"@AliBeemerPR I think once GMA shared their early exclusive (8:48am), it may have prompted some others to post early too.

Overall it's great to see trust placed in the hands of online outlets – and even influencers – when in the past they would never have been trusted with embargoed coverage."
31,"@AliBeemerPR Assuming you're talking about pew pew space stuff, I saw a couple outlets jump the 9am gun by a few minutes this morning. And a handful of minor videos yesterday and overnight on one YouTube channel.

Otherwise, pretty rock solid. I'm impressed."
32,"@nickytea @RobyMB I’d love to see if presented that way…

Do you want the “choose your own adventure” where it feels like YOUR experience, but you won’t see everything?

Or do you want “breadcrumb mode,” guaranteed not to miss any of the biggest moments, at the expense of personalization?"
33,"@nickytea @RobyMB I think it’s literally the price that’s the issue here.

Branching narratives are great. Sharing unique adventure stories after the experience is great.

But for $6K - I at least want the OPTION to see it all. Let me choose to skip something. Don’t force me to miss the best parts"
34,"Alright, concluding the flood of Galactic Starcruiser spoilers &amp; thoughts with a beautiful piece by @BrookeGMcDonald about how strongly immersive experiences can emotionally impact people, bringing them closer together.

That's what it's really all about!

35,"I do hope this experience doesn't just get handed off to ops to simplify and optimize for efficiency.

But instead, I hope it's a playground for WDI to keep evolving and improving."

37,"""I am not made of money and for that price, I hope for and expect near perfection.""

Another gem from @amy_geek.

Amidst all the coverage today, this is exactly what's holding me back from booking Galactic Starcruiser.

I'll hold off for v2.0, when all the bugs are worked out."
38,"""The schedule overflows so much that the finale even cut into my dinner on the last night.""

Seems to be a common thread among most Galactic Starcruiser visitors – TOO much going on. I'd hate if I had to choose between a story moment and a meal.

https://t.co/hVyCRdBcDg"
39,"@rheinwaldjones As @amy_geek put it:

""I don’t think it’s reasonable to tell someone they can just try to do whatever they missed on another voyage. There is no next time for most people with the high costs involved.""

https://t.co/hVyCRdSO1Q"
40,"@rheinwaldjones I agree with that mentality, but you never know what people like and don't like. Even if there are no ""lesser"" tracks, it opens the door to reactions like ""aw, I wish I had seen that"" or ""that sounds more fun than what I did.""

At $6K, those feelings are much harder to swallow."
41,"@KevinPerjurer @ScottGustin That's my biggest beef here – for $6K, I want the promised fully immersive experience, where nothing breaks that immersion.

I get that the ""story"" is one of a cruise ship, so this technically make sense ""in story.""

But... this isn't Star Wars. Breaks that immersion, to me."
42,"@AliciaStella Kinda the sad reality here is that everything that was meant to be in Galaxy's Edge for everyone to enjoy is now put behind a massive pay wall.

I get it. But I don't like it."
43,"@ThemePkConcepts A great point. In @attractions' write-up, they noted there was one major ""wow"" element that one person in their group got to see while others didn't, and that was disappointing.

For multiple visits, that's fun. But for $6K? I'd better get to see ALL the good stuff in one go."
44,"As Sleep No More famously puts it:
""Fortune favors the bold.""

I really do hope that Galactic Starcruiser enables mainstream tourists to see the value in actively participating in an experience, not just letting it be spoon-fed to them."
45,"Some are quick to say ""eh, that feels like work.""

And that's fine. There are plenty of relaxing vacations for those who want to lie by the pool, have some drinks, sleep a lot, or stare at the stars.

But those who crave adventure – this is the call."
46,"This notion of ""you only get out what you put in"" has been at the core of immersive theatrical experiences since Sleep No More debuted in 2009 – 13 years ago!

The masses have yet to fully embrace this notion that the most engaging entertainment requires a little bit of effort."
47,"""Passengers get back what they put into their time aboard the Halcyon. If you suspend your disbelief, embrace the story and participate without self-consciousness, this will be a trip you, and your family, will never forget.""

48,"That's exactly what this is – bringing the excitement and spirit of adventure of the Star Wars universe to those of us who aren't Jedi... but wish we could be.

That feeling is what you're paying thousands for, it seems."

The irony, of course, is: https://t.co/N2fIADm9nl"
50,"This seemingly isn't about surprises. Mysteries to unravel. Secret passages. Exploration, discovery. Awe-inspiration visuals. So many things that make something like Meow Wolf tick.

Nah – this is about living in the world of Star Wars. Or, at least Disney's version of it."
51,"There's not a whole lot of mystery. There really isn't anything being shown off today that we didn't know about already. A few more details here and there of how it all plays out.

So knowing all that in advance, what's left?

The actual adventure of it all. Living it."
52,"What's fascinating me right now about Galactic Starcruiser...

It's really hard to distill the excitement of this experience into some photos, videos, and write-ups online.

It's like we've seen it all and there are no surprises.

Because it's about the EXPERIENCE of being there."
53,"This is phenomenal. I want this in my house.

Literally should be a partnership with @Amazon. https://t.co/2pT9o5ccXt"
54,"So interesting to see different sides of all this.

56,"Branching stories with multiple concurrent story paths is HARD to execute and make everyone happy, without spelling out the whole story in advance.

It's like people need to know what they're getting into before they actually do it, somehow without spoiling it."
57,"Results were similar – some guests LOVED their stories and came back as many as 10 times to experience all the branches. They could because the price was only ~$45 per visit.

But other guests started on a path that didn't resonate with them and never came back."
58,"We've created multiple immersive theatrical productions with branching narratives and have seen the triumphs and perils of this first-hand.

When Shadows Fall (in Orlando, 2016) had 12 different tracks that could be chosen from a tablet, a simpler version of this data pad."
59,"Video games let you go back &amp; play different levels and branches multiple times, with no extra cost. You don't have constant FOMO because you can easily just do it again.

In immersive theatrical experiences, I'm always bitter when I end up on a ""lesser"" track without knowing it."
60,"Absolutely the #1 challenge of IRL immersive branching narratives – not all choices are good ones for everyone. 

You can end up with a path you just don't like, leaving you wondering if you would have preferred a different track.

And I’ve heard from multiple trusted friends that were there this week that absolutely loved it. And that makes me happy."
75,"Universal’s social media and PR presence, by contrast, feels so real. So genuine. So friendly and warm.

It’s no wonder their fan base is glowing all the time while Disney’s gets increasingly bitter."
76,"This is why I’ve specifically been posting about the marketing and PR surrounding the Galactic Starcruiser - not the experience itself.

It feels a bit fumbled in many ways, much like it was for Galaxy’s Edge.

Too manufactured. Not authentic. We all see through it."
77,"The world of PR is weird. At its best, it’s delivering inside access that otherwise wouldn’t be seen.

But at its worst, it’s manipulative and disingenuous.

And it’s kinda hard to tell the difference these days."
78,"I have no skin in the game anymore.

But I do still have a very positive impression of most of Disney’s PR staff. They were genuine and kind and helpful.

Except a select few. Who were ruthless and talked to me like a child. That was never fun."
79,"It’s not entirely an evil system. It’s understandable to want to control the media narrative. But it is a flawed approach in today’s landscape.

Today - we never know what we can trust any online. The assumption is that everything might be faked.

And this just heightens that."
80,"I also fortunately had enough of a large audience that they couldn’t avoid inviting me for a while, as they knew I’d just go myself and cover it anyway. They’d rather try to enable me to have the best story possible, which I always appreciated."
81,"I agree with Len’s “echo chamber” comment.

While fortunately did cover MANY amazing events and grand unveilings, I became increasingly disheartened over the years as I was encouraged to be a “good media partner.”

I was scolded many times."

83,"@averagestreams @oneearrabbit We will see a LOT more tomorrow as press embargo lifts.

84,@smitchhhh What if the website was just always a 10? 😳
85,"@PatrickSKling And it will undoubtedly attract curious mainstream types.

I hope this can help open those eyes to new forms of play, for sure.

86,"@PatrickSKling I hope all that is true.

So far, only certain “types” of people have become regulars and superfans of things like this. Alternative people. DnD’ers. Etc.
