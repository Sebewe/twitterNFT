It’s so easy to just spend hours scrolling and get lost in all the craziness. 

It makes such a different just putting the phone down and doing something more therapeutic like reading before bed 🖤"

Glad you are taking some breaks as well. Sending you love and positivity 🖤"
3,"@mikecampau Oh trust me I didn’t think it was by any means! 

I appreciate you sharing it because personally I’ve never seen a collection around balance. 

I know it’s sold out because I immediately checked once you shared it 🤣🤣"
4,"@rohling_chris Thank you my friend 🖤🖤

Definitely wasn’t an easy decision to step away but felt like the right thing to do and it absolutely was necessary for me. 

Feeling good now and ready to get back into the swing of things and be more present 🙂🖤"
5,"@jeminninft @BuzzedBeeETH Thank you Jem 🙏🏽

I’ve talked to way too many people going through similar struggles currently so it felt important to share what I’ve been feeling these last few weeks. 

Appreciate your kind words as always 🖤"
6,@roddy_nft Such a simple yet efficient solution… 🥲

I’ve always struggled with balance and I’m definitely trying to make more conscious decisions around it. 

Thank you for sharing and creating that encapsulates these important reminders 🖤"
10,"@zainyyy98 Completely agreed my friend! 

Mental health is so important to me but sometimes you lose sight of the big picture. 

Much love Zain 🖤"

Not easy to do but super important. 

Sending you love 🙏🏽"
12,@shakkablood Love you queen 🖤
13,"@giovannigussen That’s a great way of putting it my brother. 

It’s hard to unplug when there’s so much positive that can be done - saw what you all did with RELI3F and couldn’t be more proud to call you a friend. 

Take some time for yourself man you deserve it 🖤"
14,"@MichaelGuidry22 So much love for you, Kobe. 

You are an incredible person and I’m grateful our paths crossed. 

The feeling is mutual - whatever you need just know that I’m here for you my brother! 

Thank you for everything you do 🖤"
15,"@vivdetta Completely agreed, friend. 

The burnout is definitely real and it can affect other aspects of our lives. 

Happy to share and thank you for taking the time to listen. 

Take care of yourself 🖤"
16,"@dannylee The vortex analogy is spot on my brother. 

Feeling much better but as always appreciate you looking out. 

Much love for you Danny - thank you for all that you do! 🖤🖤"
17,"@dipitydoobie Enjoy your time away, my friend!

So important to take some time away and makes returning (when you feel comfortable) all the more refreshing 🙂🖤"
18,"12/

Don’t let something you love become a burden on your life. 

Treat others with respect. 

Discourage FOMO and negative behaviors. 

Prioritize taking care of yourself and make sure others do the same. 

Surround yourself with good people. 

Love y’all 🖤"

Lastly, let’s work to make this space better for each other and the people that have yet to join our NFT/Web3 family. 

Let’s hold each other accountable to create an environment that’s healthy and positive for all of us. 

Make sure to check in on your friends in the space."
20,"10/

My advice is to take care of yourself. It seems obvious but it’s easier said than done. 

One of the best things I’ve done is now reading before bed as compared to falling asleep to Discord/Twitter. 

The littlest changes can make a significant difference."
21,"9/

Ultimately, like anything, it comes down to balance. It’s not easy to incorporate balance into a space that demands every second of your time. 

Many of us have others that depend on us. Many of us feel like if you step away for a few days you’re going to miss something."
22,"8/

I took about a week off and I feel exponentially better. I feel rejuvenated and excited to get back into the swing of things. 

The things that feel like they required all of my energy just a few weeks ago now feel much more simple. 

I feel like I’m back to a healthy place."
23,"7/

The constant pressure to be “successful” relative to others can be draining. 

We’ve normalized behaviors that do not uplift others by any means. We pride ourselves on “we’re all going to make it” but don’t care if we tear each other down along the way."
24,"6/

I empathize for people that have struggled with similar emotions and experiences. 

Artists that struggling with their creative process, builders that feel like they cannot do right, collectors that do not enjoy what they are collecting, etc. 

This isn’t how we should feel."
25,"5/

Everyone enters this space at different times. While I think overall things have got better since I’ve joined, I also think other areas have got much worse. 

As more people join, I get anxious at the idea of them picking up negative tendencies that are considered the norm."
26,"4/

I found it difficult to respond to DMs from people I really care about in this space. I found it difficult to post tweets. Every little task felt like it required so much effort. 

As the days went on, I felt like I was letting more and more people down."
27,"3/

We all love this space for many reasons. Whether it’s the ability to create or build, the financial opportunities, or establishing genuine connections with others - this space offers so many positives in my life. 

Unfortunately, this is all the more reason to be consumed."
28,"2/

I recently just returned from a trip to Panama with my girlfriend and I feel better than I’ve felt in a very long time. 

My mental health was not great. I love this space more than anything but the sad truth was that something I love was really impacting me in a negative way"
29,"This space can be EXHAUSTING. 

Whether you are an artist, collector, founder, builder, moderator, or someone that wears multiple hats - I cannot recommend enough taking some time for yourself. 

I know I’m not the only person that struggles with this, so here’s a little 🧵

59,"@PissgangOG Agreed - wanted to include this as well but ran out of space. 

I won’t get into how derivatives discourage creativity but more importantly would ask the question:

Why would you WANT to be the “next” anything?

Create your own lane…"
60,"I’m getting tired of seeing projects/influencers weaponize the term “__ is the next BAYC.”

People will leverage FOMO if they can profit off it.

While things can change and diversifying your portfolio is important, I don’t plan on selling any ETH any time soon. 

In fact, I encourage people to find ways to stack ETH (trading NFTs, dollar cost averaging, etc.) if possible."
74,"Smart decision considering creators are starting to realize they don’t need huge Web2 platforms to monetize their content.
