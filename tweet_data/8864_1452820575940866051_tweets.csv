4,"@same_mfers @sartoshi_nft @PhariseesHouse @pinedegen Imo it would have been different if this was actually the format you used, making it distinguishable.  But it’s not.  You right click saved in an effort to profit off the community.  Do what you want with the art but leave our lord @sartoshi_nft 's name out of it 🙅🏻‍♂️"
