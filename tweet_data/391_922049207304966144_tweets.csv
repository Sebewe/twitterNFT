43,@dtrain22k @BYOPills @nft2040 I originally seen @DanVerno post about them that’s when I got on
44,@ZechNFT @BYOPills @nft2040 👀
45,@CryptoMarketRay @nftworldsNFT @iamarkdev @br0wnblockchain So through my whole family life savings in this financial advice you say lol
46,@ShardiB2 They outta be ashamed about this. Wouldn’t be so bad if the wait was this long
47,"Ok, yeah I’ll be at SXSW."
48,@NFTgirl @smilesssvrs
49,@BunniesRarebit @bryanbrinkman As in events not associated with nft nyc.
50,@TheeHustleHouse @BYOPills @nft2040 They partnered with them so I expect some more stuff in the future. I already received some weapon airdrops from this
51,@HollerLeanne Your house
52,@Toys_Soldiers @MotionMarkus You must have missed my comment on saying I’m bullish on IF I love them a lot but even if I minted I would have sold at 10eth. I’ve been in the space long enough to know I would be able buy back lower after reveal. This is always how it works.
53,I think @zachxbt is the Chris Hansen of Web3 😂 https://t.co/uQd2QLPgt7
54,@bryanbrinkman I had a better experience outside of nft nyc honestly
55,@YallStreetLance Is beanie a scammer
56,@Toys_Soldiers @MotionMarkus That’s up to you how take the advice. Well as long as you know your risks by holding through post reveal
57,@SonsOfCrypt0 @CryptoVonDoom @BoredApeYC @VStrangeYUGA Nope you’ll know lol
58,@Toys_Soldiers @MotionMarkus But the advice was good so what am I missing here? I guess if you want to be gambler and always hold through hype post mints so be it good luck to all.
