0,@danielgothits But there are tests that are pretty acurate for Covid. That is why I was confused with what u said
1,"@danielgothits Well I don't know about what type of tests they use... for instance here in Argentina they use the ""fast"" test that is available everywhere but that shit will only go posittive if you are ending the disseas or already is gone so 100% bullshit on that"
2,@NFTLlama Broo i was trying to make you laugh the other day #llamafollowme
3,@danielgothits Lol why do you say that? What is a scamm because there is a lot of tests

5,"@paisajismo10 @continicio La mentalidad de ""ella lo incitó por como se vestía"" es un pensamiento de un violador te guste o no... porque al afirmar que eso es verdad literal le estas dando validez al violador y le estas quitando la culpa y poniéndola en la víctima..."
6,@paisajismo10 @continicio Haber leo en serio me dices que no ves que tu comentario estaba pero muy muy mal? Hay una cultura y una sociedad que reprimió a las mujeres por siglos con una cultura patriarcal donde la culpa siempre estaba en las víctimas...y sin querer (espero) perpetuaste lo mismo x1000
7,@paisajismo10 @continicio Wow como tergiversan todo no??? Ahora con toda la conversación podemos decir sigues siendo un pelotud* con mentalidad de violador

28,"@NFTSasha Wtf is going on, I am so lost but can someone explain what is Starlink and why it would help Ukraine?"
29,@rugpullfinder @Cyborg86nft Also @JohnCena and @ParisHilton wtf would you follow this project that had 1000 red flags from day 1.
30,@rugpullfinder @Cyborg86nft They stole everything and just wanted to get more out of this people ...they keep going at this but it just sucks to see people are buying into this...it would be good to know the real name of this Scammers.
31,"@rugpullfinder @Cyborg86nft They had a bot in their discord that wouldnt let you comment something with the words ""rug pull"" - ""scammers"" - ""pump and dump"" - ""lies"" - ""Red flags"" .... the bot deleted the messages and the Mods banned you if you did... and the people in there didn't even watched your comment."
32,@rugpullfinder @Cyborg86nft As this was not enough after the price dropped... they still lied to the people in the discord saying they where about to use 1 million for marketing and some bullshits...begging for people to list above 4 eth they offered to pay the gas they spent on everyone who listed at 4eth
33,"@rugpullfinder @Cyborg86nft Of course by this the team payed for publicity and marketing lying saying they sold out in 4 minutes and getting celebrities to post them on their stories people like Ronaldiño, and the Notorious Scammer @FloydMayweather"
34,"@rugpullfinder @Cyborg86nft After practically begging those 900 people to list above 4 eth... because they where promised: 
Cydog nfts for free
Free eth.
""Exclusive"" chat with the founders.
Some other bullshit I can't remember.
The floor was 1 eth... so as a good pump and dump they released the second mint"
35,"@rugpullfinder @Cyborg86nft Then they blamed it on ther ""dev"" wich is bullshit ... and waited for days to released a new mint for the rest nfts... in this time they focused on doing a PUMP AND DUMP trying to control those 900 members making whatsaap groups with them and ""buying"" them off offering to pay gas"
36,"@rugpullfinder @Cyborg86nft This was a RUG PULL 100%... 
- the proyect had like so many CHEAP bots, blank account that didn't even had a name!!
- the mint was 0.23 eth (WTF) and then when NOBODY minted just 900 people... they STOPED the minting and said there was a problem that the minting was actually 0.16"

51,"And now dropping some #ALPHA 
I just asked @ethmaurice about IP? and If they could do the amazing #BAYC move on the IP. (giving the individual IP to their owners) and this was his response: 

 🌟""WE ARE FULL CC0"" ⭐️(no copyright reserved) https://t.co/kzsYNeBXO9"
52,So what is next for @StarcatchersNFT ? https://t.co/mzvCHG4W9g
53,"So Wen Rarity?
Official Rarity does not exist at the moment (and may never) - but there are certain rarity platforms that are already hosting the collection. Even though they dont officially endorse these, well they are free to use.

I dont know if you get this but it is HUGE."
54,"They helped the people individually and they listened to everyone, they showed us that they really cared.
This is one of the many cases that shows how this team works: 
https://t.co/8ZZC2XrdUM https://t.co/MhYlsVrh04"
55,"As soon as there was problems with @WeatheReportNFT they had to protect their community and cut ties with them. 
to be fair, they compiled pdf to prove they didnt do anything wrong. My point is they cared more about the community than the money. ✊✨https://t.co/t54Qszuye7"
56,"The Discord was closed so that they could grow a real community organically and there was no grinding for Whitelist (or should I say ""STARLIST"") because we all know how that circus works... they gave SL to real people who had real contributions and real conversations...💫🌟⭐️"
57,The Stars wont shut up against injustice and will act to help the people suffering from it. NOT like other biased projects out there... all proceeds of this and more will go to the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 all made possible thanks to @reli3fxyz  👏👏 https://t.co/N9Pe9cdNV4
58,"- They included the contracts for the StarVault (founders vesting vault w/ timelock contract), GnosisSafe (Community Treasury), founder wallets, and core team wallets. ALL FULL TRANSPARENCY. https://t.co/VqjY084pJo"
59,"Why I am bullish on @StarcatchersNFT  🧵👇
Everything about Starcatchers has been so new and so transparent, here is a summary:

- the majority of the founder's minting revenue will be locked away via time locked contract for a period of FOUR years."
