0,@NFTshawty Ok this has to be one of my favorite Russian incompetence videos so far 🤣
1,"Enemy column destroyed in Mykolaiv region containing 800 vehicles

Caused by Ukraine's air force and ground troops."
2,"FYI, just so you know the correct way to write these cities names. Don't fall for Russian's imperialistic propaganda. https://t.co/07mpkD1aDg"
3,"@mikadinozzo haha yea, unfortunately fiat works a bit better than crypto these days. hopefully that changes in the future"
4,"@mikadinozzo https://t.co/OWgNie1m4p

so far looks like cash, but maybe that previous link can convert crypto for these accounts."
5,@mikadinozzo it was just announced yesterday the humanitarian account. maybe not updated yet.
6,"70 Japanese on their way to Ukraine to join the foreign legion.

どもありがとございます！！"
7,"@mikadinozzo https://t.co/1KntTpnclt

maybe this is good as well, for other cryptos than the main ones"
8,@mikadinozzo the national bank of Ukraine takes donations for humanitarian as well. Two separate accounts so ppl can choose where they want their money to help. Idk about crypto but will check now

17,"@Delusionaldonk @mmmaaaatt thank you, I agree"
18,@dotsats hope to meet you in person someday too!
19,"@OsakaFlakka honestly idk. If you were in a border country I'm helping a lot of people get there who need to cross and somewhere to stay, but from as far as USA I think money just helps best. Can't really ship food or supplies in from so far awU"
20,"I know people talk shit about 'thoughts And prayers' but tbh, on the receiving end of them I find them quite soothing. 

To know so many are looking out for me and wishing me safety is in a lot of ways genuinely helping. 

Thank you everyone!"
21,"@nfthanbanana thank you, staying safe so far. Today was a good day, only one air raid. Yesterday had a crippling panic attack so thankfully today was mostly quiet here"

35,"@CedsSim @ABigThingBadly @heckman_eth yes, that one is legitimate too. But I believe that's mainly for weapons and civilian territory defense forces funding"
36,"@heckman_eth @ABigThingBadly I'd personally vote humanitarian now as I'm seeing so many refugees fleeing, so an org to help them would be good. I need to look into which ones are legit though, lots of bad actors trying to take advantage of the situation"
37,"@ABigThingBadly @heckman_eth oh thanks for bringing to my attention, I will vote today also. 
I'd be happy to find an organization. Are we thinking direct to the military, or more humanitarian?"
38,@Versuhtyle Yea people who virtue signal support without condemning Russia or Belarus are just 🤮

56,"@usleepwalker yep, sad to see. Active protestors are the only innocents. Everyone else is complicit"

80,@VinciousVectrix the only video where that was the case was a group trying to rush the refugee line. Expats have their own crossing lines and do need to show documents.

91,"@HysteriaCrypto most likely. The only incident that was legit was a group of African students trying to rush through the refugee line. Those trains and border gates are strictly for Ukrainian refugees, if they have documents they can cross anywhere, all borders waived visa for any nationality"
