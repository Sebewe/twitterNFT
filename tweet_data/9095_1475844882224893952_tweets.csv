41,"@notmbwNFT @BigHens2k5 @NothiNFT @NathanHeadPhoto I hear all this.But as a community if we write off people without giving them an opportunity for rehabilitation what does that say about us?She’s not bn arrogant about the issue, she has apologised and is making efforts to sort out the people from her community that was affected"
42,@BigHens2k5 @NothiNFT @NathanHeadPhoto She has been called out consistently for the past 3 days.  She even hosted a TS to address the issues where people came on to speak on the situation and she owned up to it. There only so much a human can take before they break. I have seen it happen. So people need to back off
43,"@notmbwNFT @BigHens2k5 @NothiNFT @NathanHeadPhoto I don’t even know her IRL, we lives in North America, I live in Europe.  But the little I’ve seen about her has good. Trying to organise spaces, spread positive vibes. She’s done something wrong but don’t forget she’s still a kid. Because she’s bn in the space doesn’t negate that"
44,"@BigHens2k5 @NothiNFT @NathanHeadPhoto Even at that.  She got caught, she faced it head on, apologised and offered restitution. What the fuck do you want from her?  Bully her till she kills herself? Will that give you some satisfaction? Huh?"
45,@Helloimmorgan has apologised &amp; owned up to her mistakes.Offered restitution.What more do you vultures want frm her? Who in their early 20s made great decisions all the time?  Everyone crawling out of your caves throwing stones like y’all are the holiest.Y’all are fucking bullies
46,"She’s not part of the core team, she literally got paid to offer WL oppo to her community. She has gotten more flak than the actual team that fucked everything up. Because you cowards think she’s an easy target due to her availability. Death threats and bullying. Disgusting!!!"
47,"All your grown mfers coming at @Helloimmorgan for the mistakes she’s made is everything that is wrong with the world right now. She didn’t disclose she got paid to shill a project, the team behind the project was doxxed and she never knew everything was gonna turn out like this."
48,"@NothiNFT @NathanHeadPhoto Read your own comment and think for a moment.  She’s receiving death threats, &amp; people asking her to kill herself for not disclosing that she got paid to shill a project. When the team was doxxed and she had no idea it was gonna turn out like this. And you think that’s fair?"
49,@Plumferno @NathanHeadPhoto It wasn’t fake. There’s a video on her page explaining everything
50,@NathanHeadPhoto Yooo this is old news now. She has apologised and owned up to her mistakes. She is refunding those that minted thru her giveaway or buying their NFTs at mint price.  She’s not a member of the core team/founders. She’s young &amp; still learning. Give her a fucking break man!!!
