18,"@JFC5102 I think the idea of wrapped NFTs is cool and innovative but to the average collector, when it is unveiled, will not look like an obvious pump event and thus feel underwhelming"
19,"@JetSetTogether My god, that is horrific"
20,@acarolcsilva Fuck off scammer
21,@otter_eth @ParallelNFT What the shit!!!!!
22,@cozywyatt Yeah I think that’s what I’m expecting - really innovative but a bit too nuanced for the average collector that wants pump 24/7

24,I’ve got plenty of doodle bags so I hope it doesn’t happen but I have a feeling doodles will tank after space announcement tomorrow

56,Sanctions are like the “thoughts and prayers” of international diplomacy
57,These sanctions are such a joke. Russia doesn’t give a fuck versus taking their most strategic territory back with the gas pipeline. I don’t want WW3 either but anything but positioning this as a complete appeasement of Putin is a lie.
58,"@LeBoredJames No, it’s more that it’s clear no one will do anything to stop them, so no world war"

60,This is a scary thought and yet I cannot even think of a scenario that is less scary. Very troubling times ahead.
61,"The world will avoid all our war as much as possible, which means Russia calling NATOs bluff will work. China will be emboldened to take Taiwan. The 3 superpower countries will then reach equilibrium with each other in the new post-NATO world."
