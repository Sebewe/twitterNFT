54,@DreamStarter_1 No amount of disinformation will fix their economy at this point. Also bearing their teeth some more probably isn't going to achieve much. Really really really hard to understand what their objective here is
55,@DreamStarter_1 or they are masters of disinformation and have lead the west into a false sense of security believe the currency has crashed and they are fucked
56,Imagine thinking the whole world is lying and the only person telling the truth is that old bloke banging on about “nazi drug addicts”

66,@jamie247 tough one. don't want to in anyway understate the horridness that is happening right now but also the average Russian didn't willfully vote for this and has been held captive by the political situation. Also arguably us doing business with their leadership has prolonged this
67,@cyberh49 and dope beats
68,@abysms11 He might have given me an oil field or two but I don't see how that means I have to give up my yacht

73,@mbsjq @richerd I'm just remixing non stop
74,@ilan_katin @theAngieTaylor yeah notifications on and also make your timeline chronological
75,While I may be making jokes I do realize on top of the Ukrainians going through hell many good Russians will now suffer. I'm sorry this is awful and not to be laughed at but it's really hard to see another option that isn't just let Putin do whatever he wants whenever he wants
76,I actually love reading the Russian news. I find it fascinating reading what they want us to think but that is almost impossible now because none of their websites seem to work and their country is falling apart
77,@Orenar4 Sorry I grew up in post war situation. My natural reaction is to crack jokes when I'm scared. If this really is the end of time it's been a pleasure to spend this time with all of you
78,@beercandid This is possible. He's definitely got final day vibes right now
79,Do you even think we'll see another televised appearance from him?
80,@Orenar4 Yep. That's it. That's all he has left. Destroy everything because he didn't get his way
81,How can Putin amp this up even higher now he's used the nuke thing? He'll claim he can reincarnate himself and nuke us in the next life too. He's topped out
82,@tanya_4d GM
83,I meant the 1 NFT we have available to be comment on the stupidity of war but now they've done another stupid war it's the most inappropriate time to sell or promote it so that one's going on shelf for now
