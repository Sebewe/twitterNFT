19,Is it time for email newsletters to make a comeback for Web 3 projects? Having a reliable means of communication only strengthens communities. How can we adapt what we already have to meet the needs of Web 3?
20,"Twitter is great for pushing out updates but similar to the Discord fatigue problem, you don’t really know if your community is reading."
21,Discord seems to be the de-facto home for most projects. Shame that most hacks seem to happen via Discord and a lot of users are feeling Discord fatigue.
22,"“PROJECT HACKED, DO NOT MINT” seems to be ever more common these days and highlights a massive problem in the NFT space - projects do not have a robust means of communicating with and providing updates to their communities."

28,"@curtisjcummings @chrismaddern And then you have the problem of explaining bugs in year-old OpenSea contracts, that were assumed safe, which result in tokens being stolen."
29,"@curtisjcummings @chrismaddern Yes and no. More experts are always a good thing, but as a buyer, I don’t want to have to track down reviews or potentially miss out on mints while I wait for a contract to be verified. It becomes even more off-putting for the non-technical."

72,"Bad Experience = 🤔🫤 + 💰

Good Experience = 😀 😀 😀 + 💰 💰 💰"
73,An experience-first approach to your NFT project and minting process significantly increases returns. Take the time to consider this.
74,@0xCorwin @madewithmason Yep. We are among a handful of other tools. Creators have no shortage of options.
75,"We have 30+ years of UX research and best practices, coupled with a powerful front-end toolkit. Creators need to leverage these to make projects more accessible and *gasp* increase conversion rates."
