2,"@BrianRoemmele Reading @RayDalio's ""The Changing World Order"" currently and it discusses this.  Sadly, I'm not too thrilled about where the West seems to be in these cycles."

JKS wants to live &amp; play in EU.  We've kept him on a salary and secured his visa but have had no offers yet.

Hopefully this event sparks some interest because he's obviously still a star and deserving of a team. https://t.co/OU00SaipRw"

5,@JustDarbz @ATSS_CS @Congli81 @SPUNJ 100%.  Justin deserves a great new home.  I've received zero offers and it's absurd.  Hopefully other teams now remember how damn good he is.
