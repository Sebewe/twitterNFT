1,"RT @NathanHeadPhoto: I see Punks Comic, Bored Apes, Adidas

Holy shit https://t.co/h0Nvos1pkA"
2,"@CryptoNFTs @PUMA @GutterCatGang To that point, they did partner with punks comics and whatever else they did. I don’t remember who but was not exclusive. Each team has their own play in these partnerships. They are not the same. To be clear."
3,"As someone who works on the backend with the rest of the team to execute, collaborate and progress the gang as much as possible I would LOVE to get support from outside projects.  I want us to be supportive. We are blessed. K. That’s all. GN. Back to work tomorrow."
4,I do not stand by the comments made about “oh they chose X as pfp” we could of been from the sidelines. I trust the process. I trust the team. And I love my community (GCG) and just fucking grateful to be part of this crazy life I didn’t have last year. I’m happy for ALL of us.
5,"I’m happy for all the communities reaping the rewards for their communities. I’m happy they’re picking us to come into a space that they’re not native from. You win. I win. We all win, right ?"
6,I’m grateful for @PUMA for giving us (@GutterCatGang ) a chance and all the partners they picked.
7,I’ve been thrown off by the constant negativity I see from so many angles lately. I get it. It’s stressful times. Hoping for the best energy for everyone.
