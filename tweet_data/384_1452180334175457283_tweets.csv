5,Let’s be real. BTC and cryptos aren’t anywhere near big enough for Russia to avoid sanctions… but this is an interesting point in crypto history. The world is watching. So… should exchanges ban Russian addresses???
6,@kevwuzy So far you’re my favorite though
7,@twopoint0x Hmmmm not sure… DM @GRMI_Studios and let them know
8,"I owe so many of you a heartfelt apology.

24,To be unclear is to be unkind. I love the NFT space for how positive most are. But don’t let positivity be a crutch to avoid having difficult talks. Be critical (nicely) if u believe it. And be open to receiving constructive criticism. Remember: to be unclear is to be unkind

98,@86Ozaru Same!
99,@ChampagnePablo @3landersNFT No worries fam… and I appreciate your passion. Just give value though and do it in a more relevant way. You’ll get a lot more traction that way plus the people you attract to the project will legitimately want to be there… I’ll check them out for sure. Is that your project?
