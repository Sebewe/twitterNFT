26,"@BT The project could still generate 1,500e and that isn’t considered a success? What am I missing?"
27,@mooncat2878 @warpsound_ai @sartoshi_nft Ahh gotya

45,@eth_ben @PickGoals @ashdre_eth @JWeb777 Me too 😌
46,@eth_ben @PickGoals @ashdre_eth @JWeb777 Sorry bud can't tell on Twitter 😄
47,@eth_ben @PickGoals @ashdre_eth @JWeb777 Technically it is utility of the punk to be able to sell the free airdrops.
48,@eth_ben @PickGoals @ashdre_eth @JWeb777 So those that say Punks offer no utility are wrong because of Meebits? 👀
49,@BalouBAYC @machibigbrother Yesss congratulations 🎉 drinks are back onto you I think 🍻
50,@captainjacknft @DroBot5004 @0x650d @Sotheby It's very in vogue atm

53,@PaddyWarburton @BoredApeYC Will be sure to bring a card
54,@thedefiedge Thanks for sharing 👊
55,A must read for anyone investing in crypto (applies to NFTs) 🤓 🤕 https://t.co/4pYAyQ2EwN
56,@azfnft @coolcatsnft That + we like the cool pets
57,@azfnft @coolcatsnft I think everyone had the same idea and waited on the sideline for the additional supply 😅
58,@eth_ben Congrats 👏
59,@0xWave @ElectionDayMad1 The kind of investment thesis I can get behind
60,"@justjamesxyz TLDR: cancel your Netflix, put that £7.99 a month into a 0.75% ISA. Heard of Einstein's best friend, compound interest? Job done."
61,@FungusCompi @sassal0x Ok mate will do. Take it easy
62,"@doctaisen @pimmhogeling I'm not sure tbh. I know Adobe are rolling out something for provenance on their platforms - https://t.co/WZ3xw1lJD1 - services, tools and social consensus will adapt and evolve to offer better solutions for creators you'd imagine."
63,"@doctaisen @pimmhogeling Because you can point to the provenance on-chain, that shows you were the first to mint it."
64,"@pimmhogeling Sorry bud, not interested. Take it easy, and good luck navigating the world with hot, sarcastic takes and opinions that NFT technology is somehow to blame for people reselling stolen art 👋"
65,@Nainif_ @sassal0x You're right - unfortunately in general it feels like the world is becoming more binary in opinion. Both sides think it's right vs wrong because they spend all their time in their respective echo chamber🤷‍♂️
66,"@pimmhogeling The NFT is on a decentralised public ledger for all to see and is immutable, unlike DeviantArt."
67,@Nainif_ @sassal0x Ethereum for example will be switching to PoS later this year which will reduce it's energy consumption by ~99%
68,"@Nainif_ @sassal0x Yeah I don't ignore the environmental impact, I just think everything online is in the same boat - its just a trade-off of, ""is it worth it?"" (atm probably not for NFTs). But as use cases increase in importance and the technology improves to reduce the emissions then definitely!"
69,@pimmhogeling This is IP theft and nfts themselves don’t facilitate theft. Nfts actually help to solve this exact issue. If creators minted their art as nfts rather than posting on deviant art they would have proof of ownership and provenance
70,@FungusCompi @sassal0x More that you bothered replying with a vague “look it up”. I didn’t think a real person would waste their time
71,@FungusCompi @sassal0x Are you a bot?
72,@sassal0x Has anyone seen any rationale on why people think they exploit creators?
73,"@shaunmmaguire Pulled the trigger at max fud, shrewd move!"

76,@cobie https://t.co/ny7We9h0Nz
77,@Coinbase_NFT Other: none
78,“Irresponsibly long” https://t.co/zEyjlPMZu3
79,@ipano_ipano It’s too soon tbh 🥺
80,"@PaddyWarburton Yeah its been tricky to remain bullish as every pfp pumps around it, but I am. It doesn’t have the same utility roadmaps others promise and is more community x art. Which I think will have its place increasingly as the market matures. (My thesis could just be propped by hopium)"
81,@PaddyWarburton Is there such thing as too many curios? Also creature world long term - Danny Cole is a pure artist with a relentless work ethic…just think he’ll go to dizzy heights one way or another!
82,@dee_szt @BoredApeYC 😂
83,@dee_szt @BoredApeYC Brings back memories of Tinder dates of old
84,"@0xTycoon @CigToken Gotcha, thanks!"
85,"@0xTycoon @CigToken I never claimed $cig, am I too late to the party?"

87,@PeortSitid @yugalabs Didn't they say in Discord a few weeks ago that it's still on track for Q1? I may be misremembering 🧐
88,@Djoir This is fake everyone
89,@domain @RTFKTstudios @Tob_Opensea @opensea_support Yeah it's tragic. Happened to me 3 times now despite revoking + checking inactive/active listings on OS. Hope you get some refunded!
