That's one of the differences that web3 will bring to the world - Global Decision Making.

Wisdom of Crowds."
53,"There's a subtle difference between the two approaches, but it's an important one.

Remember. Sometimes ppl at the top are ""good"", but they can be ""bad"" as well. 

We need a system that can handle both cases. 

You can never know on which side your children will be in a century."
54,"In the future sanctions will be done by deciding not to trade/accept another entity's funds.

Thanks to the blockchain's provenance you can easily trace it &amp; execute upon it!

In practice, if enough entities participate, the sanctions will be the same - frozen funds.  

But..."
55,"I'm against WAR and I'm not naive... but!

Freezing funds of individuals/countries don't make sense. It implicitly says that a group of ppl can decide what/who's ""good"" &amp; who's ""bad"".

And that's bad...

Future sanctions will look different!

81,@wbrasil_eth I agree. But I thought the convo is about “on-chain” vs not (without thinking on the actual blockchain implementation)
82,@danielkoeth GM/GM/GMGM ❤️💎
83,"@wbrasil_eth The main upside is that your NFT is stored on a single blockchain-  i.e. if ETH dies your NFT will die. But how about a case where ETH dies &amp; FileCoin survives? At least the metadata survives. 

So to sum up, I have no clue what to think ;) ❤️💎"
84,"@wbrasil_eth I’m still trying to think about the difference between storing the metadata on-chain VS file coin. 

I think it’s more complicated then we think. 

For example, what happens if you store the metadata “on-chain” with the data in a deprecated format?"
