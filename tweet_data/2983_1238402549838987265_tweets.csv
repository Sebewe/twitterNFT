35,"Name of my NFT collection: Twistheads 
Launch date: Friday 25th
Type: Auction
Platform: https://t.co/zSJfRKKsIA
Feeling: Excited 👀"
36,@g0d_nat @coolkidswalknft They stole an animation from a motion designer as if it was them who created it. And after the backlash came back with poorly animated pieces. Maybe it's just a matter of taste but it looks bad. And the account has more than 20K...
37,If you are going to mint a @coolkidswalknft I feel sorry for you
38,@kidclaytv they look amazing!
39,@claire_salvo Can't wait to mint my @WGMInterfaces so I can order a ballpoint recreation of it from you!
40,@TinyFacesNFT Thank you for all your help!! So hyped for the project!
41,"@adriancerda Thanks man! There is no whitelist or early access, so keep your eyes peeled for the release of the first piece!"
42,"@TinyFacesNFT Hey again. You sent me a few hours back a screenshot with me being whitelisted on discord but I don't see my ""og"" role on discord. Could you help me? thanks!"
43,@TinyFacesNFT I'm in!!! Thanks for the help lol
44,@TinyFacesNFT I didn't change my twitter account

47,@TinyFacesNFT still doesn't work
48,"@TinyFacesNFT I signed out of of the discord app from my laptop, phone and tried to log in back both on the browser version, desktop app and mobile app and it still doesn't work :("
49,@TinyFacesNFT Thanks for the reply! For some reason it doesn't appear on the left side of discord. Any idea why is that? https://t.co/1dg66Pr1rm
50,@TinyFacesNFT Hey guys I can't join the discord even though I got a discord ticket. Could you help?

65,@Bobaxi_ PayPal c’est brutal
66,@Rager Damn that must have been a soul shattering time
67,@MatVoyce @opensea Hey Mat! I appreciate your insight! Yup   I know Foundation doesn’t allow multiple copies of the same NFT. Still thinking about it! Keep killing it with your collection!
68,@FFeygin @MatVoyce Great to hear! Thank you for your input man!
69,"@FFeygin @MatVoyce I agree with you Felix! Also, the choice of the platform is super important and I feel like Foundation has a more ""high quality"" look which makes the art look even better in my opinion"
70,"That would give multiple people the opportunity to obtain one of the 1/1 they like. 
BUT I also like the idea of creating a collection based only on unique 1/1 pieces. 

Curious to hear people's thoughts about that"
71,"Regarding my first NFT collection: It won't be a 10K or 5K collection. It will be a collection only of 1/1s that will be built on the long term. 
What I'm still considering is if each 1/1 will have multiple ""copies"" like what @MatVoyce is doing with his ""Walking"" collection 1/2"
