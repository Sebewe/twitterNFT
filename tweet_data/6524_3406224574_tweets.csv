5,"Music NFTs are not about price speculation, and waiting around for someone to buy it.

It's also not a quick fix.

It's the application of the technology, a shift in mindset, and allows artists to build sustainable businesses with less fans, while knowing exactly who they are."

It's not that you need to leave that all behind completely, but once you stop relying on things you have no control over, you will get your energy back."

43,"So, if you see a small music blog putting in the work, be sure to appreciate them.

There's not many left, and if we want to see more editorial opportunities for new artists, these smaller blogs are so important for that."
44,"Running a music blog gets incredibly fatiguing not because people don't really care at scale, but its when the artists don't appreciate the work.

A blue check + follower count does not make a music blog worth more, it's the time it's been around and the quality of its curation."
