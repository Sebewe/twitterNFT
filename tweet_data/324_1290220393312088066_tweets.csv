4,@coolcatsnft @evanluza what do you think about the idea of a maximum amount of claimable $milk per day ? It would help with the limiting the circulating market supply and good for price stability.

33,"We performed an internal test that showed some issues we need to work through, but our team was doing quests, buying boxes and getting pets to final form.

Stay tuned to discord and twitter for future updates!"
34,"You may see a Pet moving from base to final form in the production environment as we test the process from start to finish (this will be adjusted and sped up for test purposes only).

So far, this week's testing has shown a huge improvement in our environments."
35,You may see some testing happening in our production environment / contracts. We are starting to test claiming $MILK and other functionality of the site.
36,When we launch the game we will likely bring it up for a window of time to allow everyone to get in and claim some $MILK and do some quests. We’ll then bring it back down to analyze the amount of traffic and adjust our rate limiting accordingly so that everyone can play the game.
37,The results of the tests will be shared once we have had time to identify and assess any issues we find.
38,"The goal is to ensure the system is not swamped with requests for blockchain transactions and running at a slow crawl. Of course, these changes require testing and that is being done internally today with the whole team."
39,allows us to handle as many transactions as possible with our current infrastructure.
40,"The response time on Polygon main net is a concern and could result in a less than ideal experience for users. However, we are aware that right now any experience would be welcomed. With that in mind, our backend team has tightened up rate limiting and implemented a system that"
41,"Recently while testing, we have seen response times on the Polygon test net of about 3-10 seconds. Upon testing the same code base on Polygon main net we started to see times of around 10-30 seconds, which is not ideal."
42,"We feel you deserve to know what we are doing, the issues we are facing, and how we are working to overcome them.

__**Tech Update**__

**Please note we have tried not to include any technical jargon in this update.**"
43,We are very aware that there are a number of questions and concerns that need to be addressed. The intention of these tech updates (stepping stones) is to share our development process with the community and answer those questions.
44,"From @xtremetom on the current @coolcatsnft developments:

56,@NFTCryptoChicks We will be relying heavily on community voice and sentiment to inform future direction.
57,"@NFTCryptoChicks We will be leaning on the community to identify women artists to partner with on artistic vision, future collections/drops, and delivering value to the holders.

We will work on a concrete plan for support OG collection holders with 1/1s and rares in any future collections."

We will provide full transparency on the allocation of royalty funds between operating, tax &amp; legal expenses, and team compensation."

62,"@NFTCryptoChicks They will be compensated, and they will continue to be supporters of the project with their own holdings of the collection. It takes time to navigate this transition, but we’re all aligned that this is the best path forward for the success of the brand."
63,"@NFTCryptoChicks Based on the decisions made during the early days, the current landscape of web3, and the strong work experience of the current team, we’ve all agreed that it’s in the best interest of the community that the founding team step back from future operations of the project."
