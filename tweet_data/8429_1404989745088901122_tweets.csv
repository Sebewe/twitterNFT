7,@trent_vanepps @CirclesUBI @BrightIDProject We can surely do that !
8,"Hi @ParallelNFT, just noticed inb0x, which is very similar to Commeth, should we collaborate ? Let's talk !"
9,"RT @RaphDeknop: I have updated the description of @Comm_eth 's Gitcoin page to provide more detail on what it is, and why a donation might…"
10,I am verifying my ownership of Commeth on Gitcoin Grants at https://t.co/NPj9P7Cc99. 🎊🎆🥂🙌🎁🥂
11,"@RealHappyBlock @VitalikButerin Hey ! Sure, you can send an email at rphad@protonmail.com 👍"
12,"RT @IOSGVC: 4/Team Commeth @Comm_eth
An application that allows registered users to send encrypted messages to each other without revealing…"
13,"I'm aware of the confusion the name can bring, due to another, older project named Cometh. I will probably change it ;)"
14,@DefiChad @santisiri @VitalikButerin @peepethApp @minds @sapien_network @steemit Commeth is worth taking a look at ;)
15,"This is where #ethereum matters outside of #defi, as @VitalikButerin put it well during #ethCC.

Messages will be deleted before the official launch but if you want to test Commeth, here is the chance ! (dw, things will be decentralized as we move on)"
16,Goal : be present @ethCC[5].
17,"I feel no pressure apart from the one I put myself under and that's  also because I'm not doing any communication. I wanted to have a MVP for ethCC but I don't want to show something half-done to people. At the same time, I can't wait to share and to see if it gets any attention."
18,"Just updated the main page, so that you all have more info about what Commeth will be ! 👀 Make sure to visit https://t.co/Nsy0CnH4qN 
Btw, launch date still TBD but there are so many things to improver and I'm not sure I want to fix them in prod."
19,Patched an important bug while testing. Launching by the end of week seems doable but difficult. Or should I say difficult but doable ?
20,"It's time to unveil the logo ! 🔥
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/ASCX9WupNX"
21,Progress really seems to follow a sigmoid function
22,"Fixed a functionnality bug that was preventing progress in other areas. A proper launch before July is too unrealistic, the estimates need to be pushed back to 2 weeks later. A lot of lessons are learned along the way !"
23,Been away from Commeth these last few days but coming back strong and full of ideas ! Some new challenges arise and time passes very quickly. Commeth just wants to see the light of day already !
24,"Code is being cleaned up and rearranged, this is refreshing and will make a smoother UX. The UI is getting better too. As for the logo, an idea has been found and it's in the works ! Doing everything to launch before the end of the month !"
25,Thinking about the users and wondering what they'll think of the UX...
26,"Currently implementing an important security feature, this is one of the last steps before making the UI and doing beta testing. It is getting stronger 💪"
27,"The server is ready. The domain name has been bought, the SSL certificate has been set up... aaand it has been verified as a brave creator ! 

Please welcome https://t.co/Nsy0CnH4qN !!!"
