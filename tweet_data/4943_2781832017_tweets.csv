10,The Russia Ukraine situation is helping crypto ?
11,@HOWLERZNFT Could've started with not releasing the real contract 10 minutes after a fake one scammed 250eth from your supporters.
12,"@PunkieEth Yea for sure. As someone who started in early August I've concluded if you were to start in May you would've needed a few hundred bucks, August, maybe a grand or two, and now way more. This is just because you need to take profits and losses many times to fully understand market"
