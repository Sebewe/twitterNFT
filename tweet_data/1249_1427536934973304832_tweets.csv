0,@CryptoStoic1111 @Luiz10chapo @_introverse_ You get any conversions from that bro?
1,@stocksinvst That candle stick patterns looks very familiar mate.
2,"@vladsnd This is what i think, which maybe completely wrong, but the fib just retraced. Bought at 2,400 and let go at 3k. Not very much profit but its a good enough swing for me. https://t.co/988Dif13po"
3,"@vladsnd Tbh its hard to say, i see the trendline similar to gold. When it was $2,150 people were calling $5k on gold. I called peak. I see the same when eth broke $4k. Trend line seems bearish, the rebound few days ago seems like a technical correction as the previous drop was 😵‍💫"
4,"Everyones so focused on flipping NFT’s for profit, and yet at times forgetting cheap deals to the crypex. Potential retesting lows for eth.. if you see price coming below 2k, looks like a great entrypoint for 100% profit."
5,@TokenBogan And proved my point right 👍🏻
