45,@Min_min372 Botting is part of the game but this is one project that doesn't deserve this. The funcles team is about a good cause (men's health) plus giving royalties to those impacted by the russia /Ukraine war. This move here isn't right on so many levels.
46,@Kornwik3 @CBCreepz I think (I hope) the id customisation will include threads from the partner. Can you imagine if its supreme? A supreme branded balaclava... or supreme branded to. Really hope the partner is fashion related and a well known brand. We will be leaving this galaxy if so

81,People making today about cash vs bitcoin. Tf is wrong with you man. Yeah we get it you don't like crypto. Blah blah.
82,@stupidestMirror @anthonyraia_ Lol I love how you all are coming at me over this. I bet you all would've said the Internet would fail lol. Also no one I mean no one has private keys stored on one device. Good luck when inflation absolutely wrecks your currency and you wnd paying 1m for a toilet roll. Lol joke

90,@anthonyraia_ @DeMinimisFringe Smh OK. I'm surprised you guys even use the Internet. Lol. Good day to you all.
91,@anthonyraia_ OK.
92,@renegademasterr @InvsbleFriends Bro there were 18 eth sales. Love the art but you're asking for trouble. I can see a meka 2.0 not because the aren't isn't sick but because it's not 18 eth art.
93,@anthonyraia_ To be clear I don't own and have never owned bitcoin. Point I'm making is when shit gets really real and physical cash becomes worthless thing such as bitcoin will remain. I really don't understand why energy is going into debates such as this today of all days.
94,@anthonyraia_ How does cash work when there are no shops open? Behave bro. In a time of war hands down digital cash is more valuable. It will always be here. Try recovering cash that's been torched in a blaze. This shouldn't even be a debate today. Tf is wrong with people. Spread love not war
95,@TheConnectedNFT if you don't know about this. Get to know people! Awesome art and a really cool community ❤
96,@MetaMythicsNFT @SmithyDAO @castlesdao2 would be nice partners. I can see it now. Wizards vs warriors for castles. All on treasure
