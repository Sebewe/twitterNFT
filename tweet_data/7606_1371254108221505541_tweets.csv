29,"and even with all this upgrades, we are still very far away from good amount of adoption,

a simple example: why does everybody use Google if DuckDuckGo exists?"
30,"yes, lower fees and staking is really good and game-changing, but is it really enough for people to totally switch to it?

I think before that happens, we must see a big website UI change, and a fix to all this wash-trading that it is happening in the 24h volume"
31,"going to keep it real,

exited $looks , the airdrop was pretty big for me, and I just feel like for the next few months, this is just a big gamble,
