basically giving them information to self select themselves away from me lmao"
58,getting a bunch of DMs already so going to give general advice— all your prompts should either share something about yourself that almost no one else would say (i.e. paddington 2 obsession) or help give them information so they can weed you out/ or you can weed them out

I won’t shut up about: how Paddington 2 was robbed of an oscar"
