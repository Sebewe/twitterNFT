18,frens @coachella #coachella i noticed the backstreet boys are touring this year but both sundays of coachella weekend they are mysteriously free? The chances of backstreet boys making an appearance at coachella is...?
19,@WildSheepEth @svarun24 @Solar77 @famousfxck @wilson_eth Agreed. So it becomes a gamble. Those projects are good for flips not necessarily long term unless the community just rides that hype train forever. And then ofc if those fake hyped projects don't sell out you're kinda fucked on the flipping end and prices can dive due to the fud

81,hi degens what should i do today
82,@jacquescolimon ethereum was supposed to be a long play but i can't seem to keep it in my bag🥲🥲😅
83,"@jacquescolimon i completely agree with you. Also what do you think the biggest pain point is going to be, since we very much are in an echo chamber. Loved your analysis on this and would love to pick your brain more. I think ig is dying a slow death but i could be very wrong"
84,"@jacquescolimon However i do think the voices of good players is starting to outgrow the voices of the bad players, and credibility is everything in the space so these people can only pump and dump so many times before they get shut down: ie squiggles fiasco and 8888"
85,@jacquescolimon i have definitely spoken about this. It looks like the space is starting to go through some growing pains and we may see a slight drop off at one point because there are influencers here pumping bags and causing newer investors to lose liquidity to rugs=/
