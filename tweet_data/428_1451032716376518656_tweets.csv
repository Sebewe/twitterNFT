4,All the recent Opensea hate the past two months seems to have vanished from the TL 🤔
5,Wonder if people have been front running buys based on this fact below regarding JPEG’d in light of the recent ape and alien sales. I think this fact alone creates an even higher premium for punks and aliens than what had already existed. https://t.co/Zsjh9UFyLI

26,@PabloPunkasso Sooner than we think imo. @JPEGd_69 is going to drive crazy value and I am looking forward to the markets reaction
27,@lacidary Compound those winners and cut those losers 👌🏻 a necessary lesson I have learned the hard way.
28,RT @Natalia_Ameline: @VitalikButerin That is tough! My vote is Metis. @MetisDAO
29,@Degentraland @beaniemaxi @digitalartchick @ColeThereum Definitely @wolfofwallst due to his track record and outstanding career success. Looking forward to his upcoming NFT project which is 100% not a rug or a cash grab

47,@mb__nft @larvalabs Thats a clean pair of punks 😮‍💨🔥
48,"@straybits1 @RedBeardAPI Understood! I missed that part and was wondering whats stopping ceo’s from just putting absurdly high buyout prices, but now that makes a ton of sense. Excited to see how this plays out"
49,"@straybits1 @RedBeardAPI Ah I see, thank you! So if I understand correctly, the higher the $cig buy out that is placed, the higher tax the ceo will have to pay up each epoch as well?"
50,"@RedBeardAPI Hm I was going off the $cig price on the website, could there be a hefty tax to swap outright potentially?"
51,@RedBeardAPI I think about ~120 eth currently. Gotta pay up if you wanna call the shots 😂
52,"@RedBeardAPI I realized I began trading against eth and not bitcoin anymore and If I think the flippening is truly going to happen, why not put my money where my mouth is! Let me know if you make the move ser"
53,@sergitosergito Also $botto airdrop and the upcoming @JPEGd_69 launch. I think we see more utility for punk holders in 2022 coming from members of the community. Makes me more bullish on punks long term. The value of a strong community outweights the value of relying on devs to “do something”
54,Not saying bitcoin is a bad investment by any means btw. I just think eth will outperform it and am placing my bets accordingly. Let’s hope this tweet doesn’t age poorly 🤷🏻‍♂️
55,"Flipped all of my bitcoin to eth yesterday. Being receptive to new information/paradigm shifts and not getting married to your bags is key. Suprised it took me this long, but the opportunity cost of not being all in on the ethereum ecosystem is extremely high currently."

61,Recently I helped a friend buy his first NFT. He scooped an amazing @braindrops_art piece from @xsteenbrugge for .35 eth. 2 days ago he called me and was estatic he receieved a .5 eth offer on it. Felt as If I gave him a gateway drug into the wild west of NFT’s. He is now hooked

86,"@MrBigTimeCEO @MincoETH @beaniemaxi @KingBlackBored @BearEatsSalmon @OfficialFoxGame @wolfdotgame I’m with you there, afraid it’s going to lose steam by early 2022. The game that can continue to operate (no pauses) combined with the best team of developers will prevail imo. I don’t think being “first” in this scenario will hold any extra weight here. We will see though"
87,@FutureBread_ @wolfdotgame @BearEatsSalmon Let the big dogs eat. Time to make future 🍞 into present 🍞
88,The first project to execute what @wolfdotgame did without any contract exploits and gameplay pauses will be a gold mine. Lets see if @BearEatsSalmon has what it takes.
