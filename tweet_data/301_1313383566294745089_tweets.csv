28,"@NFT3vis @itstimothypark Absolutely correct, I’d personally recommend building up to 5-10 ETH before trying secondary players as there’s more room for error that way."
29,"@KristnsNFTs I’m guessing you held through reveal, there was definitely an entry and exit for profit for gooniez prereveal even thougj they completely screwed up their launch. Not sure about tsuki though"
30,@squirtstudio If you really wanted to enter at the lowest amount I’d recommend 105+ because a lot of people use 100 and 101 because they want to front run each other hahaha
31,@squirtstudio Have a read of their white paper here https://t.co/wnGB01Hgvi
32,"I wanted to add that the 3 strategies I have for WL/Hyped projects are very situational based on the % of whitelist allocated and the total supply of the project. 

If whitelist % is low, then buying from secondary is much safer on the initial reveal dip as well as minting public"
