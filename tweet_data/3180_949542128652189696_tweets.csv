3,@KingMooosey Haha I’m sure you will do alright. How did they mess that up?
4,"@ARTMAN141 @LooksRareNFT @RaritySniperNFT I agree, dai is underrated.."
5,@KingMooosey Wow what happened there 😂
6,@ashleymadison This web3 domain maybe of interest to you. It can be used to send and receive crypto payments and much more! #ens https://t.co/bLv0OMvs0j

8,@LoganOP_gm Bigbrains.eth
9,@Ukraine Setting an ens domain in this situation would be a much safer and easier to manage option.
10,@EnsSales Probably nothin
11,@0x_kobe Still solid sale. Who owns decentraland domain and how does the sale process work?
12,@0x_kobe Wow. Why didn’t that show on the ensbot?
13,@zerozerocoins Nice one fren 👌
14,"@0x_kobe But that’s where the record sales will come from. From there subdomains will be massed produced to employees, users etc and the ens ecosystem will thrive"
15,@seekmine @coinbase @ensdomains Companies that adopt new tech and continue to find innovative ways to market and do buisness will be the winners IMO.
16,@0x_kobe Wait to tech managers advise companies and institutions it’s a requirement for the future 🤯

45,"@TheFarrow @nicksdjohnson @futurealisha @ENS_DAO @ensdomains @DomainsEns Great question! On the forefront the team has been very quiet since the departure of Brantly.
