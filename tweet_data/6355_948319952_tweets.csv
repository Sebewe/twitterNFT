13,@EagleFangsports @MichaelLeipold @PennStateFball @MicahhParsons11 @dallascowboys @NFL The graphic is depicting Micah Parsons and the mantra he lives by!! TF don’t you understand??? It doesn’t need Nittany Lions. Sean Spencer called the Dline wild dogs. If they had a graphic with the Dline and dogs pictured in it you wouldn’t be questioning it. Man you are dense.
14,@MichaelLeipold @PennStateFball @MicahhParsons11 @dallascowboys @NFL What? It has to do with PSU because it’s Micah Parsons. 🤦🏼‍♂️
15,@EagleFangsports @MichaelLeipold @PennStateFball @MicahhParsons11 @dallascowboys @NFL It’s a graphic of Micah Parsons and Lions because when Parsons talks about his mantra almost on a weekly basis he’s talking about the king of the jungle and not a Mountain Lion. Not that hard to understand
16,@MichaelLeipold @PennStateFball @MicahhParsons11 @dallascowboys @NFL The Lions have nothing to do with Penn State in this graphic. Micah has his own mantra for himself that goes “When the Lions hungry he eats”.

45,@SteveTu73357179 @Ben_Jones88 4 of 5 starters transferred out. A first year coach who has us competing in 3 out of 4 B1G games is all we can ask for with this bunch. I honestly think Shrews has us at a point in two years where we will be expecting a tourney birth. Just need a couple more talented guys
46,"@VelasInvestor @flurnft I think Monday will have another plunge. I’m expecting 1,900 or so"
47,"@lunchboxbrimz @thefastwinger @moonwalkmagick @NetflixEng Honestly NFTs are a  good investment, bad investment, terrible art, amazing art, extra perks, scam, social prop ups , rugpulls, sentimental, demeaning…  and a hundred other things."
48,@lunchboxbrimz @thefastwinger @moonwalkmagick @NetflixEng The utilities and community a specific NFT offers can be even more valuable than the collection item itself. Most people aren’t investing because they like the look of the art.
49,@thefastwinger @moonwalkmagick @NetflixEng Lmao just looked at this dudes profile. He’s “anti-NFT” like he’s starting a political rebellion 😂 shits hilarious.. before he knows it they’ll be less and less of people that think his way. It’s already grown exponentially just in the last 6 months.

61,@RLRblog Damn. Really gonna miss his defense today. Pickett will have to have a monster game
62,@Spidermarvel21 @PeteThamel Absolutely Elite. He even made the giants Dline formidable a year after they were hot garbage. PSU was one of two schools to go 3/4 straight years with 50+ sacks. (Don’t quote me on that stat but I think it’s right) PSUs sack rate dropped exponentially after he left.
63,@nomadblvd is the pass a reservation for whitelist or is it a reservation for mint? If i have a pass do i still have to pay a mint price?
64,@BlueWhiteSports @saquon @MicahhParsons11 Possibly? It’s pretty much a guarantee Parsons is winning DROY

77,@TakeGrader @nebs33 @PSU_Strong Our starting RB averaged 4.9 yards a carry. Oline was terrible but as I said a stud like singleton will make our run game seem much better. We had no RBs with any explosiveness off the line whatsoever.
78,@nebs33 @PSU_Strong I think we were honestly spoiled with Barkley Sanders and Brown. Luckily Singleton will be next in line to make up for the Oline deficiencies

88,@audsnyder4 To be fair the two yard fake kick against Michigan we were driving down the field really well on that drive.
89,@darst_jacob @TDISportsClips Saquon until he tore is ACL*
90,@BRob211216 @CamBlurn The OL was showing steady improvement under Fautwein (sp?) until this season. It’s really odd tbh. Like did they not let the Oline 1s go against the Dline 1s? They looked weak and like they didn’t care.
91,@StillthinkingSK @DmainEvent95 @KDisthegoat_35 @HeyHeyDB @ProFootballTalk But if that’s the reasoning behind everything it would probably be smart to not be a cheerleader jumping around as you exit.
92,@BlueWhiteSports Instead of standing there clapping like you aren’t really sure what’s going on but still want to use positive reinforcement 😂😂
93,@jmsilvis @seanfitz247 As a WR3 KLS has shown a lot of upside. Either him or Tinsley will be perfectly capable of holding down the #2 spot.
94,"@AlexDLerch @euchre13 @PennStateOnBTN @Coach_Shrews That’s the point… this team isn’t good we know that. They are average at best but that roster talent level, with the transfer-outs we’ve had, is very very below average. It’s not mutually exclusive to want to wait out the “good coach label” and be impressed by what he’s shown."
95,@AlexDLerch @PennStateOnBTN @Coach_Shrews Man it doesn’t take years and wins/losses to tell that shrews’s basketballs smarts are light years ahead of Chambers. Chambers barely ran an offense and made some of the most boneheaded decisions as a HC. Iso and shoot or Iso and dish was our whole offense for years.
96,@AlexDLerch @PennStateOnBTN @Coach_Shrews My point is Chambers could recruit but wasn’t a good coach. This roster lacks big time talent and that’s obviously the reason for it but is showing they are well coached. The great news is Shrews has already proven to be able to recruit well also. Bright future for this team.
97,@PennStateOnBTN @Coach_Shrews This roster would have 2 total wins with Chambers
