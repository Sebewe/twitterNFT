10,@ZssBecker Margit the Fell Omen has yet to fall on day 2. Need to grind a few more levels I think. The challenge is highly refreshing. Can't wait til my fantasy rpg homie gets into it with me.
11,"I edited lore and names and descriptions of weapons for @CryptoMonkzNFT, had three meetings within @CCollectiveNFT, listened to an AMA, and did both literature and psych homework and still haven't strategized how to beat Margit the Fell Omen. The difficulty is fun!!

12,@AlexanderMalan2 You almost had it sluggee
13,@0xJah @NoahKai_ I just spent the better part of an hour strategizing against some random named mob in a dungeon. Ngl the challenge is actually fun. The wandered back outside and get slaughtered by three mobs xD
14,@NoahKai_ Same but at least the challenge is enjoyable. Good to feel challenge and strategy in a game again
15,"@ParlingtonSteve Confessor seemed rad - died in courtyard to weird scion thing then died to tree boy. The difficulty makes it feel fun tho.
