1,@EdgeRyunosuke @ballerxbt Kings have concubines.
2,@n4n084191635 @scupytrooples @intocryptoast How so?
3,@kunalb11 I even wrote a poem on this. https://t.co/2Ymx4J1QxO
4,"@teemupai For the alternatives to even compete, infrastructure isn’t the real front they should be focussing on, because that won’t matter.

The social aspect is what they’ll have to focus on: network effects on both the user side and the developer side."
5,"What’s dangerous about the current narrative on social media is that other nations and organisations will limit their help, assuming that everything is under control."
6,"On social media, Ukraine is winning. 
In reality, the war is still ongoing.

Propaganda is most definitely being pushed from both sides. If the numbers are true, Ukraine says it has killed more Russian soldiers in 3 days than the US lost in Afghanistan over 20 years."
7,"Cause: SWIFT ban.
Effect: New financial order (between China, Russia, India, Iran, etc.)"
8,@christi10006880 @GKeeto @BillAckman So perspectives from third parties should not be considered just because they haven’t been on the field?
9,@ASvanevik It’s harder to go to war when there’re no borders.
10,@christi10006880 @GKeeto @BillAckman How does a war expert become a war expert when they haven’t faced any real wars as there have been no real wars in recent times?
11,"With every ban or sanction on a nation, web3 gets more valuable."
12,@safetyth1rd Grateful.
13,"@fintwit_news @BillAckman I’d put my money on him, than a lot of actual military strategists."

15,@josephdelong One of the reasons we built our “DAO” with a hierarchy instead.
16,"@danheld Only because every other risk asset is surging. When shit hit the fan initially, all risk assets (including bitcoin) dropped. Gold was up.

I’m crypto all the way, but let’s not lie to ourselves."

18,@santiagoroel https://t.co/VM1h5N0JCw
19,"Sanctions and diplomacy require mutual respect and an understanding between the parties involved for them to even work. 

After all the sanctions imposed on Russia already, Putin has no understanding or respect left for the west. He is not accountable to anyone anymore."
20,"@maxdesalle If anything, the sanctions made them anti-fragile. Allowing them to get self-sufficient and build their power from the inside."
21,"So, the west is imposing more sanctions on Russia in retaliation. 

You really think that’s going to stop Putin? This was probably his best case scenario in terms of consequences."
22,"The probability of WWIII happening just tipped in its favour, and people are still trying to time the markets. 

This isn’t even an overreaction. This is playing out in real time."
23,"@sairarahman That’s because women weren’t in power. Those who were, did.

24,@safetyth1rd I wouldn’t even go that far. I’d say reading and researching in defi is alpha simply because most people hate effort.
25,@Niquelandia It does have something to do with enforceability. Nice try though.
26,"@Niquelandia With pseudonymity and anonymity, physical world entities and individuals can detach their identities from their virtual counterparts, making it extremely hard for any jurisdiction-based authority to pinpoint metaverse ‘lawbreakers’ in the the physical world."
27,"“16,000 metaverse trademarks have been filed by Chinese companies”

Ironically, the metaverse is out of the jurisdiction of any government or authority, making legal enforcement near impossible."
28,"If most NFTs are dependant on relevancy and hype, this is a signal in said direction. https://t.co/2q0Wlp8Ats"
29,@Blockworks_ Value /= Price
30,"I’m not saying that NFTs don’t have a future. Just like ICOs, which are an extremely valuable capital raising mechanism. 

But in the current iteration it’s at, it’s mostly fluff. And when the time for people to pull some money comes, with no bids, they’ll sell cheap."
31,"NFT crash, like the ICO crash.

Note: not a prediction, just a high probability scenario."
32,"Fear to greed market cycle: 

Phase 1: Price follows fundamentals.
Phase 2: Price follows changes in fundamentals.
Phase 3: Price follows the anticipation of changes in fundamentals."
33,@EyalShay2 My wishes are perpetual.
34,"People think that crypto is exempt from macro cycles without realising that crypto isn’t even old enough to have experienced a compete macro cycle yet.

Last recession: 2008 
Bitcoin founded: 2009"
35,@manishbg It’s down to tradeoffs. They’ll have to pick the least shitty option.
36,"Option 1: Control inflation -&gt; Raise rates -&gt; directly benefits the masses. 

Option 2: Don’t control inflation -&gt; Keep rates low in order to maintain interest payments they have to make on their own debt (which amounts to $30T) -&gt; directly benefits the market and themselves."
37,"The fed is facing a double-edged sword, which at some point they’ll have to stab themselves with. 

An implosion is inevitable."
38,@KyleLDavies Markets don’t live in the present. They live in anticipation of the future.
39,"Canadian police just ordered exchanges to “freeze crypto addresses”.

42,"@tbr90 Now, imagine the impact the fed is going to have when they raise those rates and start selling those bonds."
43,@TheStalwart Going to need an address to courier my coins to you.
44,"If you have to closely monitor your portfolio, you’re closer to Bill Hwang than you are to Warren Buffett."
45,"While markets might’ve priced in the impact of interest rate hikes on assets and their liquidity, they have not priced in the impact of interest rate hikes on the actual economy. 

P.S. economic impact affects the fundamentals of what underlies the assets."
46,"@safetyth1rd I’ve been intermittent fasting on a 22-2 window for a long time now. Only one meal a day.

Isn’t just about the weight loss for me. It has long term benefits that you’d be shocked to hear for the minimal effort you have to put in."
47,"Remember that an asset can lose 90% perpetually from any point it’s at.

I.e. just because you bought an asset after a 90% fall from its highs, doesn’t mean you’re protected from another 90% drawdown. 

I’d recommend evaluating the asset’s underlying reality instead of its price."
48,"@Jason I’m putting myself out there. 

- 2020-2022 = 2300% after fees. 
- Exited markets November 2021. 

Performance can be tracked in real-time and transparently as I’ve only adopted an on-chain fund structure.

49,"@SpartanBlack_1 Pricing in the impact of rate hikes might’ve been done. 

Although, the market has not and cannot price in the impact of rate hikes on the actual economy and the fundamentals of what underlies assets. https://t.co/nfRAcX2R2o"

55,"Bear markets aren’t just about drawdown size, but drawdown period as well.

56,"12 rate hike cycles since WW2. 

11 of 12 cycles followed by recessions.

68,"Art packaged as tokens is still art. 

As the market for art-based NFTs spreads further, so does the liquidity. Making it harder for you to sell what you own, unless what you own remains relevant."
