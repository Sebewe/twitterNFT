1,"@yayalexisgay OMG @yayalexisgay - nailed it. So funny (because it's sadly so real). Some co cultures are better these days, but many factors still lead to employees feeling the need to be ""always on"". What first are exceptions &amp; one-offs seem to quickly become rule and culture."

46,"@USEmbassyBtown So grateful for you! Thank you for being there and jumping in to make sure @daleyervin was safe on his adventure. Your support means the world! ...as his adventure continues in your region, I've got you on speed dial😉."
47,@PWilsgaard @SahilBloom @HarryStebbings @ChrisAshenden Yes we do! Many existing customers in Singapore!
48,@SahilBloom @HarryStebbings @ChrisAshenden Yes! We ship almost everywhere humans live. Local distribution in UK/EU as well. And it's AG1 for me too - there is nothing under $100 and nothing under 90 seconds (how long AG1 takes each morning) that has a higher return on investment and time for me.
49,@aaronpaulos @daleyervin 🙏🏽
50,@nabeeleats @MichaelMartocci @hi_rankin @karimatiyeh @AmandaMGoetz @nicberardi That's how it starts...

Time for my O2 mask to go back on!"
56,"@IvyAstrix @uscoastguard @USEmbassyBtown @StatiaTourism @KateAtwood @brian_m_davis thank you, Ivy!"
57,"@iiiitsandrea @uscoastguard @USEmbassyBtown @StatiaTourism @KateAtwood @brian_m_davis ...+kids were trying to grab the phone &amp; yelling, was a complete sh*t show. I went from - that could have been the last call with my husband, to hands shaking doing internet searches + phone calls and texts, to taking a breath knowing severe injury or death was off the table.🙏"
58,"I'm grateful for @uscoastguard, @USEmbassyBtown the people of ""Statia"" @statiatourism @KateAtwood @brian_m_davis &amp; Captain Vince who helped us coordinate a boat to get to them in time. Now, as they reset the course and wait for a better weather window, the adventure continues..."
59,"Friday night was a call you don't want to get, thank goodness it did not turn out to be the worst, but very bad. @daleyervin capsized twice when he rowed the Atlantic w/ a hurricane north of them, so for him to say this is the worst, it was bad. The ocean, always, is in charge. https://t.co/yC1My1ICqF"

73,@KristyT @JoshuaOgundu I wonder if this has changed materially since 2002
74,"@KristyT @JoshuaOgundu ...yet I also thought -- given this cliff...even more amazing...those that break the stats against the odds or write their own rules, start business, build, and make their way outside a traditional path."
75,@KristyT @JoshuaOgundu My heart hurt seeing this.

84,"Hubs @daleyervin just left Antigua rowing to Miami (~1600miles, 23-28 days). More to see this time than the Atlantic crossing (islands &amp; boats) but more to collide with, so please send ""don't hit our little boat"" vibes.
