18,@borjamoskv @ENSDomains4U @Galaktic_Shaman Gotcha. Thank you. I suppose it wouldn't hurt me to try to expand my skill set
19,@borjamoskv @ENSDomains4U @Galaktic_Shaman How do you sell with a bot? Is there a resource online that I can learn about this? I'm not super tech savvy so if I have to program from the ground up I don't think that would work for me

21,"@SashaDj10 Also gave up on the shotgun technique, promoting my domains everywhere. Instead focusing more on having fun with the process and working with others to expand our reach. I figure even if it doesn't make a sale now, I might learn something from the experience that'll help later"
22,"@SashaDj10 I think we're at an awkward point where there's demand, but low discoverability potential. A sale at this point basically requires the stars to align in just the right way. I'm just treating it as a practice of patience and keeping my domains unpriced"
23,@griffds This is what I found https://t.co/J77yr0X432
24,@griffds There's no way to track down the domains origination point? I'm not the best at navigating etherscan

43,"@pvt_eth @tradens @HandsomeHenry6 @ARTMAN141 @Twitter @warnermusic I believe the main domain holder has 100% control of the main domain, and the ability to issue/revoke subs"
44,@tradens @HandsomeHenry6 @pvt_eth @ARTMAN141 @Twitter @warnermusic That's a good point too. It can be used to grant/deny access to subscriber services based on who holds a subdomain
45,@tradens @HandsomeHenry6 @pvt_eth @ARTMAN141 @Twitter Didn't know that. Look forward to when it rolls out and more documentation on how to use it
46,@HandsomeHenry6 @tradens @pvt_eth @ARTMAN141 @Twitter One way would be customer aggregation. For example @warnermusic could issue subdomains to each artists fan bases. It would allow them to hold a detailed dataset about customer preferences and purchases
47,@tradens @HandsomeHenry6 @pvt_eth @ARTMAN141 @Twitter I think they've already rolled out CCIP-read for L2. I'm just not sure how to use it yet

51,@CM_Jubilee @Playboy @PlayboyPlus Aw thank you. There are lots of good people in the community. It would be nice to get a discord together so we can all start coordinating our efforts
52,"@CM_Jubilee @Playboy @PlayboyPlus Exactly. And even if playboy doesn't immediately discover it, or isn't ready to dive in, an unpriced premium domain could attract speculators"
53,@CM_Jubilee @Playboy @PlayboyPlus Honestly I feel leaving good domains without a price is the best way to go for a few reasons. A high price tag may psychologically deter offers. But also it could potentially limit your profits. Better imo to let offers build and accept when the offer is right
54,"@CM_Jubilee @Playboy @PlayboyPlus Considering they currently use https://t.co/NtqcP5bt2M I think it's an excellent domain. I've also tried reaching out to corporates before and had no luck. Probably getting shut down by a gatekeeper. You could try reaching out to Crystal Hefner, I believe she's on Twitter"
