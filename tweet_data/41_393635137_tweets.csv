0,"25/ Some have claimed that our world view has been distorted by absolutizing things that are more relative ( e.g. power, money) and relativizing things that are more absolute (e.g. morality, truth). Maybe that can be turned around with the future that Web3 deserves."
1,24/ In some way it’s ironic and paradoxical that Web3 will likely require us to rely more on technological regulation via AI that will restrict our freedom more than we gain via decentralization. George Orwell's 1984 might well be a reflection of the future metaverse.
2,"23/ If you don’t disclose this information, but it is found out by others/algorithms, it can have an impact on your TRUSTH scores. It’s unfortunate that mechanisms and measures like this are necessary, but as we said earlier: https://t.co/SfSzt0fesq"
3,"22/ Transparency pervades all domains and each person will be asked to provide certain basic input such as your wallet addresses, disclosures about (financial) relationships with (past/future) projects, alpha groups and/or other influencers (and their wallets)."
4,"21/ The famous quote “History is Written by Victors” comes to mind. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated and the winner writes the history books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered enemy."
5,"20/ But this will require further evaluation as “truth” is a social construct that is (more) difficult to algorithmize. Some think that certain “truths” are misinformation that should be censored, while others think it’s wrong to censor “truths” by calling it misinformation."
6,"19/ If an account has a lot of engagement from “fake” followers or “bots” via inorganic, fraudulent, or dishonest means its score will be low. In the future further weighing can be given to accounts that have shown to be more “truthful” than others."
7,"18/ This can be based on different metrics: the repetitiveness/originality of messages, the amount of deleted messages, the number of times people are blocked by this account, the number of times the handle has changed, ratio of followers to friends, interaction, etc."
8,"17/ A similar sort of approach can be taken for Web2/Web3 social (media) networks and we don’t rely anymore on the amount of followers someone has, someone’s IRL reputation or promises, but each account has a TRUSTH score."
9,"16/ After that moment, the TRUSTH scores will start to become dependent on your trading behavior, and how much it can go up/down will depend on a smart algorithm that takes into account your buying/selling pattern and volume."
10,15/ Or you can pay a one-off “fine” to increase your TRUSTH score and compensate for all the errors of judgement that you made in the past. The money will be distributed to those with a high(er) TRUSTH score that were affected by your wallet transactions.
11,"14/ Once the algorithm is defined and tested, the idea is that everyone will receive their score which remains invisible for a few weeks. If you have a low score you can do nothing, but you risk the value of your NFT assets will go to 0 and not being part of the community anymore"
12,"13/ If you are consistently showing opportunistic, selfish and unethical behavior (large amounts of wash trading, lots of TornadoCash’ing, lots of WL/minting abuse, lots of undisclosed paid ads revenue streams, etc, etc), your TRUSTH score will likely be low."
13,"12/ We also don’t want to punish people who happened to be “fortunate” enough to discover the NFT space first, but we need to be able to trust the people that are currently so influential in this space based on their actions (read: blockchain behavior)."
14,"11/ So how is this TRUSTH score calculated? That remains of course up for further debate, analysis and consensus, and it’s not meant to be petty and punish people for opportunistic mistakes and experiments that they made in the past."
15,"10/ Of course only wallets with significant NFT assets and high TRUSTH scores may be deemed reputable enough to invest in (with or without doxed teams), so we don’t have to constantly assess each upcoming project and in particular all these scam projects."
16,"9/ Any new projects that will be created will have to have the wallets and TRUSTH score of their founders listed, and if the founders “rug” the project, either they will see their TRUSTH score getting very low or they can refund/compensate the community."
17,"8/ Discord channels and any future minting will be based on a particular TRUSTH threshold, so if your score is too low, you are basically not part of the community and won’t be eligible for any of the perks that people with a score above the threshold will have."
18,"7/ The TRUSTH score associated with your wallet and listed on every NFT marketplace will become more important than anything, and people buying NFTs from wallets with a low TRUSTH score will see their own score immediately decrease significantly."
19,6/ Let’s start with the blockchain. Recent advances in AI have made it possible to create algorithms that can identify how “trustworthy” each wallet address has behaved over the past months/years and assign a TRUSTH score to each wallet based on that.
20,"5/ We call it TRUSTH and it stands for Transparency, Trust and Truth. Trust refers to your digital actions on the blockchain, Truth refers to your digital words on social media, and Transparency pervades both. They are all (inter)connected."
21,"4/ We have thought about some self-regulating mechanisms that will either remove any bad actors completely (and will reduce the value of all their NFT holdings to nearly zero), or ensure they do compensate for their past wrongdoings. How?"
22,"3/ It's about influential nefarious actors that have either been exposed or haven’t yet been exposed but are currently still able to remain active and even expand their influence, buying into blue chip projects, and enjoy all the NFT perks that you can possibly imagine."
23,2/ Most people active in the NFT space have now (finally) seen the amount of bad actors that are very active/productive and they manifest themselves in all kinds of different ways. The most problematic is when they continue to remain or become more influential in this space.
24,1/ Our idea to make this space more ethical is by making morality more valuable than money in the future. It will pay off to behave ethically and it will cost you if you behave immorally. We provide a decentralized self-regulatory blueprint as a starting point for discussion.
25,"Dear @nftchance - we hear that you are creating novel concepts with interesting implications, but for some reason you seem to have blocked us and we can't read your messages. Any specific reason why you blocked us and any chance you can unblock us?

26,"Social media platforms do have a lot to answer for.

https://t.co/eR1w2VYmZr"
27,@0xFlick No. We want to make ourselves completely redundant and are proposing self-regulating mechanisms that are largely decentralized.
28,"We mentioned the Pareto principle before which states that roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes:

20% of wallet addresses own 80% of NFTs.
20% of scammers are responsible for 80% of scams.

We will soon propose a radical solution for this.

33,"It's quite shocking, but we have other things to do this weekend than NFT'ing.

We noticed some messages about Pixelmon. It's often quite easy to discover someone's identity. In this case you have to know that the former Twitter handle of Syberer used to be Dippysucks. Good luck."

36,"No surprise here as well. @TFGmykL is known for creating lots of fake hype, clout farming, and then ditching the project. First @ApeKidsClub, then @NFTMTG (and @bapesclan), and soon his own avatar project. 

We might do a big Fortnite/esports NFT thread.

37,"Yes, @swipathefox rugged a project, because he didn't have any time. Should have thought about that before starting it.

39,"@NFTSecurity For context, please see: https://t.co/KCWhRFChpE"
40,3/ Putin has (ab)used a fake version of “democracy” to basically become a democratically legitimized dictator. Russia banned a picture of Vladimir Putin in drag four years ago. We actually think it looks more like the clown that he truly is. https://t.co/UfO1XaWDj6
41,"2/ We owe a lot to individual Russian people in terms of science, literature, art, music, etc. Bob Dylan’s paternal grandparents emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine) to the US, one of many examples of brilliant minds that originated from Russia."

59,"The least trustworthy people in this space are often also the most greedy and productive ones. The majority of (slow) rugs &amp; scams are created by repeat offenders who jump from project to project. And they continue to find new victims who are new &amp; naive.

60,"@CoachP1421 @MetaKryptVault Just to let you know that we have also been blocked by this person, even though we had never heard of this account before (and never reported about them). Maybe Twitter needs to consider adding an option that shows by which persons we have all been blocked (for transparency). https://t.co/SHJPIonToy"
61,@Mezmon1 It was a typo - it should have been 5000 ETH. The dollar amount is correct and also the chart attached shows the right amount.
62,"3/ The NFT was immediately sold after it was transferred. Scammers are abusing the trust that people generally have in the digital space (instilled by Web2), and it's truly sad to see that we are forcing people to become far less trustful towards others because of all these scams https://t.co/kktbDTHaMF"
63,"2/ We contacted that person and yes. First 0.3 ETH was paid to become part of an ""alpha group"" and then an NFT had to be transferred to whitelist the address in the Discord. All complete lies of course, abusing the trust of new members of the NFT community. https://t.co/9GpMQ4PRdc"
64,"1/ Yes, @toriadawson is a big scammer. A ""verified"" account with almost 100k followers, that new people think will have to be reputable, but it isn't.

66,@st_baggerton It's this project minting later today https://t.co/bjnhArx1am
67,@brijsurfing It should have been 5000 ETH.
68,17/ In some podcasts you can’t escape the thought that they have used their young audience in the esports space to attract their parents to become part of this particular NFT project. The influence of esports/Fortnite streamers in the NFT space cannot be underestimated.
69,"16/ And the CEO of Kungarna is of course TFGmykL (TheFortniteGuy, Michael Padilla) and we could have done a big thread about him alone.He was initially listed on the Bapes website as an advisor, but has been replaced by another person. We wonder why? https://t.co/ohbnMQHWw1"
70,15/ But guess what? He was picked up by Kungarna - for which two of the founders of Bapes are working. https://t.co/XnaR8FPUb0
71,"14/ Pluck engaged a streamer (Khanada) who has lost everything in the esports space as he was banned from Twitch for his violent threats/bullying behavior, and then also banned from Youtube. https://t.co/Rslq1BtKaS"
72,13/ The reason for saying this is that one of the founders has a history of multiple failed projects (and Twitter accounts). He also removed his current business Pluck Esports (which was not very successful) from his Twitter profile. https://t.co/rUwTtmLO2F
73,"12/ There can be a cultural disconnect. In Europe, everyone who has one failed business is basically not taken seriously anymore, while that is the complete opposite in the US. You have to have a couple of failures to be taken seriously and you can even become US president."
74,"11/ Another one asks a question about why they don’t take a bit longer than 1.5 month to ask for $13 million USD and if we can see the smart contract in advance. The founder again comes up with a long-winded story. They talk a lot, but never seem to realize their inconsistencies. https://t.co/pUytDpfgmB"
75,"10/ If someone asks about why they initially announced an astronaut to be part of the project, one of the founders said he screwed up and asks an ambassador to better answer the question. The ambassador then basically says: wait till after mint and then we go to the moon. https://t.co/G5CucS65CT"
76,9/ Yesterday was another Spaces with Bapes ambassadors. They all talk as if this project is the best thing since sliced bread. Zero self-reflection or a warning to people that don’t know anything about NFTs that the value of most NFT projects will go to 0. https://t.co/T7bXYTnw9D
77,"8/ If all these ambassadors are all so seemingly successful, why do they have to be paid and how much? And why have these ambassadors been chosen? https://t.co/PTUXVulC73"
78,"7/ One guy went from $100M to bankruptcy, another one spent some time in jail for not paying his ex-wife the divorce settlement, while yet another one has a history of sexual misconduct. And another one has a private Twitter profile where he seems to be shirtless (no idea why?) https://t.co/e6t26AFxvj"
79,"6/ In this podcast, one of the founders mentions that they are great because “we always surround ourselves with incredible people” (1:10:10), but if you look at the history of some of the ambassadors, you have to wonder how/why they exactly are selected. https://t.co/qDFyIqDH2c"
80,"5/ There is an 80%/20% split of the mint profits: 80% goes directly to the team (to pay all their staff, “ambassadors”, etc.) and 20% goes to a community pot. Even though it was marked as “fake news”, a Discord message and recording shows otherwise https://t.co/hztXbSW3kw https://t.co/UBzguUxSMJ"
81,4/ On their website they seem to have (purposely) left out the mint price for the NFT on the question how to buy one. The ETH price has gone a bit down but they would still net 500 ETH (over $13 million USD). https://t.co/u7MFvCdlfy
82,"3/ We have not been active in BapesClan Discord, but listened to limited parts of a couple of Twitter Spaces and did some online research as well. The high mint price is always by definition a red flag, especially for a project that claims to do everything for their community."
83,"2/ It remains strange to us that many that are planning to spend 0.5 ETH on any project, don’t seem to do any research at all. If someone on the street asks you to give him/her $1300 USD as an investment into something, wouldn’t you do any proper due diligence?"
84,1/ We will limit our tweets about upcoming scam projects because we would otherwise be sending out tweets every minute. We just follow up on Bapes(Clan) as that is a project with doxed people and as such is quite unusual.
85,LOL 3.0 https://t.co/li6yKGKJ29

89,"24/ Are there no good people? Of course, there are. The majority is good, but as we already mentioned before this space favors the least ethical and most immoral persons, and they are productive and dominant in this space. And it influences others to behave unethically as well."
90,"23/ Many influencers have troll armies that try to influence the truth or perceived demand for a project, not by objectively assessing the validity of the evidence or arguments, but simply by using large numbers of vocal accounts to artificially manipulate other's perceptions."
91,"22/ All the people that come up with allegations or conspiracy theories against us never have provided any proof/evidence, in the same way that we have provided proof/evidence. We have never been paid by anyone in any shape or form and will never accept donations."
92,"21/ We always said that actions always speak louder than words, whether they are digital or physical, and we are of course willing to have this verified."
93,"20/ Exposing Beanie was financially the worst decision that we could have personally made, but we did it and didn’t sell any NFTs before his exposure. We also never benefited from trading in NFTs in any way by using this account and the blockchain will provide that."
94,"19/ Some people want us to dox ourselves so that they can silence us IRL, something they tried but couldn’t do digitally. Others have questioned our credibility or ulterior motives."
95,"18/ Of course we receive a lot of criticism for our work, mainly from scammers/criminals that don’t want their ""business model"" to be jeopardized, or by hypocritical influencers that don’t want their true nature to get exposed and like the status quo."
96,17/ They will soon become so (financially) powerful and influential that they determine the (ethical) direction of this space. They will become too big to fail in this space.
97,"16/ He was defended by many people, who apparently do not seem to understand that the new Steven Cohen’s are created as we speak with all these influential and morally corrupt individuals that are ruling the NFT space."
98,"15/ Also with his current company he has shown that his moral compass is not pointing in the right direction, but if you have a net worth of over $13 billion, not many people are able to stand up against someone with so much money and influence. Some successfully did however. https://t.co/bMVmDsxA8b"
99,14/ We highlighted the story about Steven Cohen for a specific reason. This man founded the company that pleaded guilty to insider trading in one of the biggest criminal cases against a hedge fund and was able to accumulate his wealth in unethical ways. https://t.co/sxo6OQPWfg
