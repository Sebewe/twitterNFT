38,@Swirled_ @FncyI @KyleForgeard Link was posted 11:35. Drop sold at at 11:34. Here’s some proof https://t.co/sjV89YWaJS
39,@blueesin1 @KyleForgeard Exactly. They’re attracting a bunch of flippers with that. If their goal was to get as many nelk fans as they could to be a member then they should’ve made it 1 not 10
40,@DwightOut @tlgill6 No ones talking about making money. There’s 50 new projects everyday you can flip. The fact is it’s bad business to tell people to pay for something so they can get WL. They knew they had over 3.5k people on WL as well which looks worse. Should’ve made it 1 per wallet not 10
41,"@blueesin1 @KyleForgeard Exactly. If you want people to hold and not flip like they said on the ama you make it 1 per wallet, not 10. They should just change the public mint to a private mint"
42,@DwightOut @tlgill6 There’s a difference between crying and calling out shady business practices. You can’t tell people to spend money on your server with a promise of WL for them to get nothing.
43,@Swirled_ @KyleForgeard So telling people to pay to boost your server so you get WL and then not having WL spots isn’t sketch? Ok. I think they should make it WL mint only at this point
44,"@KyleForgeard How tf you make presale list, tell people to boost the server for WL, and not post the mint link till it sells out?? U takin advantage of the community"
