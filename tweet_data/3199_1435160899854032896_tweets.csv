30,@bigleaguin @YawwwNFT IMO QTs are not undervalued rn( at least not from a value investor perspective) but that doesn’t mean to say they can’t pump 10x. They are proven/ building something useful + have a good a brand. So ppl won’t necessarily price them based on fundamentals.
31,"@bigleaguin @YawwwNFT My bad read that bit wrong. Yeah likely rev &lt;1m. You should also consider that P2P trading platforms always struggle vs CEX. So expect the same with an MP. Lending is also going to be massively competitive, there’s lots of competition brewing already."
32,"@bigleaguin @YawwwNFT Don’t you mean 24mil revenue? (ME) atm id say yawww does 1-2 max, have you tried to work out their numbers?"
33,"@CryptoAnglio Most decent projects in the space have minted via their own website. Minting on a launchpad is more of a red flag, becos, it requires less technical competence + more chance it dumps from the additional hype it brings. New role to my minting- never mint on a launchpad."

82,"2/ Kitten supply is very low (1025) &amp; floor is thin.  They are tightly held( 2.4% listed)  When $zion pumps, there's going to be a supply shock/ increasing demand &amp; making kittens look much more attractive. They should outperform cats/mutants in terms of % price increases."
83,"1/ Kittens are cheap rn. Don't forget the multiplier stats. 

-If you own 3x cats, buying 1x kitten will earn 10 more $zion per day vs buying a 4th cat
-If you own 4x cats, buying 1x kitten will earn 40 more $zion per day vs buying a 5th cat
