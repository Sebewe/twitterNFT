3,@smilesssvrs What’s this?
4,@elliotrades You’ll continue to crush. I’m sure if it.
5,I’ve come across a lot of amazing dialogue on CT lately and I’ve learned that this movement isn’t just about $$$. It’s also about how we interact with each other. I’m optimistic that the purity and anonymity of blockchain can lead to more egalitarian outcomes.
6,"2/2 your focus and your thoughts. If you’re happy, you’re already making it.  Stay in the zone and keep growing. WAGMI doesn’t have to mean we end up rich. Mental freedom is everything."
7,"1/2 For better or worse, remember that your version of there would doesn’t have to be like the world that is presented to you online.  You’ve probably already existed as different versions of yourself and new ones are yet to come. If you don’t like where your life is, change"

10,@SmileFckrs @Versuhtyle @BoredApeYC @CryptoCannaClub @CryptoMories @GutterCatGang @MonsterBudsNFT @WFVnft @smilesssvrs @ApeKidsClub What’s the event about?
11,@twocommapauper These watches are nice but this is just dumb.  I agree with the sentiment of this post. There is way too much new money out there and asset allocation has gotten absurd.  I’m hoping for all of our sakes that things don’t collapse around us.
12,@CaptvArt @rarible Stoked on your art.
13,… also a quick shoutout to @KrownCryptoCave who called this via TA rather than opinion/speculation a few weeks back.
14,"3/3 Don’t buy ATHs (greed) and don’t be afraid to buy when everyone else is riddled with fear.  Do your research, pick your favorites, have conviction, and zoom out. Dec may still end well but it won’t be the top."
15,"2/3 expecting.  The market has taken a part of increased pain and shaken out more weak hands and over-leveraged positions.  I’m no expert but this has been a learning moment for you as it has been for me.  I’m personally still a bullish as ever for the coming weeks, months, years"
16,"1/3 A lot of influencers were wrong regarding how things were going to play out in November and December.  Regardless of what you think of him, @RaoulGMI called it accurately. Everyone thought it would play out like previously Nov/Dec tops but markets never do what EVERYONE is"

18,What do you guys think? https://t.co/q69tIM7mam
19,@CaptvArt Looking forward to you offering these new pieces.

22,This would be amazing but the data may be showing something very different. Here’s to hoping. https://t.co/UPoq4jMOln

27,@Tweetybirdpaul @painfreelife13 @zhusu @satsdart Timing is everything.
28,"A lot of FUD or possibly innocent fear on here today.  I haven’t “made” it in this space but one thing I can say with certainty, is that I’ve missed massive opportunities because I behaved conservatively in moments like these."
29,RT @CaptvArt: Made art today https://t.co/zyM7nHu7eB
30,@CaptvArt Dope
31,@painfreelife13 @zhusu @satsdart Immediate growth potential.
32,"@painfreelife13 @zhusu @satsdart On top of strong fundamentals, AVAX is seeing rapid project adoption and institutional interest. It’s also much more accessible to retail investors. Although not the most technical response, this alone makes it a better investment in the near term."
33,RT @zhusu: Ethereum culture suffers massively from the Founders Dilemma. Everyone is already far too rich to remember what they originally…
34,"RT @zhusu: Yes I have abandoned Ethereum despite supporting it in the past.

Yes Ethereum has abandoned its users despite supporting them i…"
35,@zhusu @satsdart I wish this wasn’t true.  I’m considering selling most of my ETH and moving to AVAX as well.  ETH no longer feels like the way forward.
36,@galaxyBTC This isn’t the bottom
37,"Does anyone else think that maybe ETH is like AOL circa 1994? Meaning, it still has time to dominate but will fall by the wayside without fundamental advancements. The current state of gas has me thinking ETH isn’t the future."

45,Has anyone else considered liquidating their 401k and rolling it into crypto in the near term?
46,@AltcoinDailyio AVAX is the one for the best gains in the best term.
47,@Helloimmorgan @BoredApeYC It’s a deal
48,@AndrewSteinwold They’ll get there. They’ve done a lot of work and have a real product. Many have already said it’s the best electric car to date. They also waited too start deliveries before going public.  I see what your point is and I are.  Crypto and NFTs are the future.
49,@elliotrades Your Twitter and YouTube have changed my life. I’m not alone. Thank you 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼.

55,@dagg3rhigh Started crypto 2016 but recently started focusing on it above other things in life.  I’m not sure how or why it took me so long to see the light. What people like you share on Twitter helps so much. Looking to buy my first NFT - current favorites under or in the low 4 figures?
