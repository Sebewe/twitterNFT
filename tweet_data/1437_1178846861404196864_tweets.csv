40,@cryptoluis3 Yesss love this energy thank you 🙏🏻
41,@DillwoodJ @mrcnylmz Yes if he had a ledger they would not have been able to sell or transfer anything without the ledger approval
42,Honestly f*** the hackers they only got 1 human clone . And it was the cheapest of our bunch . Clone X will be worth so much more that I’ll be able to set my dad up for life in a few months when we go to the moon! Expensive lesson learned. Get a ledger!
43,@RobertToth8 Thank you 🙏🏻
44,"@Paisios_of_Meta No ledger, he logged into a fake opensea I think he put .com instead of io"
45,@shanestott Signed into opensea. Com asked for his seed phrase and he fell for it even though I told him 100xs never to put his seed phrase anywhere
46,@SpaceballEth @cas3333333 Yes transferred all mine today ! Wish I would’ve gave him one sooner
47,@mrcnylmz 100% ledger is an absolute must since day 1 honestly
48,"@Mileniooo I know ugh, I’ll set him up for life when clones hit new heights!"
49,"@ptrck_ono Yes a ledger asap and never our ur seed phrase anywhere , be careful the links you click on"
50,@justcryptofeeds 🙏🏻 thank you. I have faith our clones will be worth so much more that it won’t even matter in a few months anyway I’ll be able to set him up for life
51,@cryptopress99 @DevCito My sister miscommunicated to him to log into opensea . Com and it asked for his seed phrase I told him never to put it anywhere multiple times but he fell for it
52,@cryptoluis3 He just had 1 clone I didn’t think it was worth getting one yet But man was I wrong . 😩 I just transferred everything to my ledger after this happened
53,@jeff_layos Usually when we mint I have him and my sister come to my house so I can oversee everything. They decided not to come over this time and do it on there own. He logged into opensea .com instead of .io and they got him . My other friend has no clue how
54,@zim_zimmar After this happen to them I’m doing that as we speak!
55,@Alts_Anonymous That floor clone was a clone hacked from my dads wallet
56,"Break my heart to say this but my dads metamask got hacked he lost about $70,000 a clone X and all the airdrops along with 6k eth. My best friend metamask got hacked a few days ago as well for 1eth. This space is so not safe for newbies, be careful everyone"
