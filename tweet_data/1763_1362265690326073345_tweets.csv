Does generative NFT artist deserve its own distinction?

Interesting to see many are using @0xPolygon for the low gas.

Vibes like this time last year for me."
36,"@HawkwardArt @emilyrosemcg Yeah, I have a shiny Starly! For me, obtaining, breeding, and competitive battling are the reason I've played the games for so long. My shinydex from the previous games is pretty insane. Praying for battle DLC, but likely more narrative DLC if at all."

39,"@emilyrosemcg I will give the game a 7/10. I just finished the main story and it was just okay. Gameplay is great, but really doesn't expand upon itself. 

Without multiplayer, for me, the game doesn't incentivize continued play unless you just like grinding for money and Pokeballs to spam."

43,"@tw1tte7 @LeonidasNFT @BoredApeYC @allseeingseneca @Chloeyeemay @migwashere2 @ThomasDagley @DooggiesNFT It's sort of hard to tell because they are on OpenSea contract and were all minted by the creator. I'm not discrediting, but I don't see the original smart contract anywhere.
