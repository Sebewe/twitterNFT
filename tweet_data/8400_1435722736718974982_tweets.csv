2,"We have 46 Blocks available for trading on https://t.co/QiFtpAzVU9 but no trade yet. As I thought, this tool is a long game and I guess it will be more used at the end of deadline to create new Panels(https://t.co/yOnGcGrObQ). https://t.co/YKBwYhyGXM"
3,@_thejims Be welcome o//
4,RT @macanudounacam: Just listed ✨🔥🖤
5,@Worldwide_WEB3 Gm
6,@Brise_eth It's amazing too. I'll need sometime to identify you quickly but I liked it. 👏
7,We have lads vs villains here 😂 thinking in a way to have the actual pfp + lad + nfvillain. I’ll try something soon. Unfortunately I don’t have good design skills 😂
8,You can also find this text on my website https://t.co/6SF97w8Crl.
9,"I explain it more on the Trade Blocks website (https://t.co/QiFtpAzVU9) and the tweets below:
https://t.co/k64PUhaCIu https://t.co/SviTg3pP5a 4/4"
10,"So, it allowed me to create this tool where are Depositors and Traders/Creators. Depositors enable the creators to find attractive Blocks from their wallets. And the traders must pay with one Block, which can be traded by the next traders, and compensate the Depositors. 3/4"
11,"This is the art created by @framergence, resumed. You can check more about it on The Panels website(https://t.co/ZGLoc5fhQd).

As the objective here is to build unique Panels, the Blocks by themself are more valuable if combined in Panels. 2/4"
12,"The Trade Blocks tool

A tool to facilitate the trade of The Panels - Blocks (https://t.co/u8ZCDgvtuJ) collection. People should trade and select Blocks to put them together, building the prettiest Panels they can in 1-year max. 1/4"

16,"@thegualla I feel it haha I participated in some raffles, but I have to be 100% sure it is real and rarely get into what needs to tag some frens, afraid to be annoying."
17,@Brise_eth @CryptoDickbutts @NFHeroes @larvalads @_thejims @PixltonNFT @nahfungiblebone Really? I thought I couldn't be noticed lol
18,"Wondering if I should change my pfp. I have @CryptoDickbutts, @NFHeroes, @larvalads, @_thejims, @PixltonNFT, @nahfungiblebone. And I love all them. I wish I have a way to have all as my twitter profile picture 😍 twitter devs do something!!! https://t.co/xpjh11YIDC"
19,@thegualla I guess there are 2 reasons to lose followers quickly: after a giveaway tweet and after getting into all retweet/follow/like/tag a friend raffles 😬
20,"@thegualla Even if I tweet, I lose followers. I also don't get much engagement. I guess I'm so bad on metaverse life 😂
The only moment I unfollow people is when they enter in many raffle tweets that my TL gets crowded by it. hehe"
21,@thegualla So hard to get 1 follower and so easy to lost 10 lol
22,@arlekin_julia @withFND Always better 😍

34,"What I like from https://t.co/yOnGcGrObQ collection is users need to trade NFTs to build something else. Similar projects could benefit from the trade blocks tool, but I'm not sure if they exist yet. Which project has NFTs that are more valuable when put together than alone? https://t.co/W6APrQrRxP"
