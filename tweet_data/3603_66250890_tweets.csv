3,@SabinaRosa_ Soon! 😍
4,@RadioRobin13 We're so glad to hear that you are enjoying our wines!
5,"@kyle_nater @Bernardaud The topper is for decoration only, so the bottle can be stored without it with no impact to the quality of the wine."
6,"@kyle_nater @Bernardaud The bottles themselves are 346mm tall with a 102mm diameter +/- 5mm.  There is a porcelain topper that goes on the bottle which is ~120 mm tall. Note: this is just the bottle and the box it is shipped in will be larger, but we cannot share the dimensions at this time."
7,@GuysGrapes Thanks for coming to visit. So glad you enjoyed the best of what To Kalon Vineyard has to offer!
8,@chisparty07 We love the sound of that. 🍷
9,@chisparty07 Any idea what the occasion could be?
10,"@DaMileHighKing The best way to store wine is at a consistently cool temperature away from direct sunlight and agitation. We'd recommend storing it in a basement, back of a closet, or in a temperature-controlled wine fridge. Hope this helps!"
11,@to_metaverse Us too 😉
12,"@blake_hagz These wines were made to age, so if you have 3 bottles, we recommend spacing out when you taste them to see how the profile develops over time! Maybe 10, 20, and then 30 years? If you can wait that long. 😉"
13,@DaMileHighKing 🔜!
14,@NeilRunions We have no plans for a Discord at this time.

48,"@jarrettjohnston Great question! Until the wines are ready (09/2022), the benefits are the same — your choice. Once they're ready, they can be claimed by the token holder. After claiming the bottle, any future NFT sales won't include the wine or extra benefits like the To Kalon Vineyard Tasting."
