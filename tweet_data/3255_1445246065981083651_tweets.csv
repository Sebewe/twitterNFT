98,@ellaorten Lot of great recommendations here but I’d add that experiencing some fails is a great way to learn. Nothing replaces experience. Ask those who’ve succeeded the most around and they’ll all tell you they have some L’s. 🥂
99,@crypto_qualia @bubblegumkids_ 🙏 thank you. They each got to pick theirs out after reveal. Thank god they agreed on different ones. Only hope the 5yr old doesn’t realize her little sister’s Dino is more valuable😂
