11,@0xKitten Haha I totally was one of those kids along with @OwenMuirMD and @FoxtherapyLLC
12,@0xKitten @0xZuwu Yeah I guess the late 90s emo kids called opensea and want their emo skulls back. I hear they are really crying about it and hopefully some good songs will come of it.

38,@sheologian @jessdkant @MichaelFulwiler I think we may be referring to different points in training and that there is a point where it does tip over into something akin to medical residency and should be paid. Post-doc psychologists get paid. Is it that there is a social work equivalent that is unpaid?
39,"@jessdkant @sheologian @MichaelFulwiler I am all for more affordable education and scholarships to attend training programs, as well as research stipends etc for all clinical training programs. I think an employee is different than a student and those who work with students have a different relationship than a boss."
40,@MichaelFulwiler By that logic med students should also get paid and I don’t think that is the solution. More crucial is that the individuals supervising and training the students get adequately compensated.
