16,"@DimiArhontidis @doodles @RTFKTstudios They have also been encouraging members of the community to pickup blender and design decorations for the Space and Loot Pod, and subsequently onboarding them officially onto the team. They've built a creator centric community, something i've yet to see from any other project"
17,"@DimiArhontidis @doodles @RTFKTstudios They are building an ecosystem, not airdropping sub-collections. They are blending digital with physical, and are the leaders in metaverse fashion. The space benefits by new projects learning from how RTFKT executes each stage of their roadmap"
