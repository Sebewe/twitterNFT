16,@HerroCrypto @tubbycatsnft too hard to pick but this one is pretty special https://t.co/tWIX49ukJe
17,@lizardkingnft @StarcatchersNFT Nice!  congrats.
18,@JackoD1980 @Burrbur1 @cryptoein @CryptoMories ok cool…just getting caught up on everything.
19,"@JackoD1980 @Burrbur1 @cryptoein @CryptoMories assuming it is them, the only thing I can think of is “cool cat” is spelled out in the trait name so it almost comes across as a collaboration for those mories and not just a derivative.  just a guess 🤷🏼‍♂️"

28,@tubbycatsnft @MoonOverlord @hoppyNFT Awesome!
29,@coldpizza_eth NFTs seem like lottery tickets to a lot of people.  If it doesn’t “up only” 1000% and stays there then on to the next possible bayc or Azuki.  Worth the rugs along the way…

61,"less than 900/10000 mfers listed on the market and they are flying off the shelf.  

- no road map
- no utility
- no influencer pumps
- no promises of games/serums/tokens
- no fs given
- just cool unique relatable mfers https://t.co/dhT538yXh7"
