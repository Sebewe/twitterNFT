8,"While these are ways to spot a rug pull, some projects might just fail

NFTs and crypto are high risk asset classes, so it's always best to DYOR before investing into any projects"
9,"6. A wallet owns 20% or more of the token supply

This can be the most obvious sign of a rug pull because that wallet can easily dump their holdings and drop the price of the token"
10,"5. They focus more on marketing and promotion instead of building the project

While a project can focus heavily on marketing, too much hype with no emphasis on actually building the project and bringing value to investors is a red flag"
11,"4. Unrealistic roadmap or projection for the project

If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

There is a difference between being innovative and having unrealistic goals"
12,"If there isn’t a white paper, that’s a huge red flag

But iIf the white paper is unclear or doesn’t have enough information, that may also be a red flag"
13,"3. Read the whitepaper of the project

A white paper is document released by a crypto project that gives investors technical information about its concept, and a roadmap for how it plans to grow"
14,"2. Do research on the team behind the project. 

Anonymous teams are a potential red flag.

You want to look for teams that are transparent with who they are, their social media accounts, and what they’ve done in the past"
15,"1. Check if the smart contract is externally audited

An audit is an analysis of a smart contract's code that is used to interact with a cryptocurrency or blockchain.

This process is conducted to discover errors, issues and security weak points in the code"
16,"While some rug pulls take many people by surprise, there are ways to recognize potential rug pulls by DYOR (doing your own research)"
17,"A rug pull is when a cryptocurrency or NFT is created and marketed to the public, but once the creator makes their money, they abandon the project.

Because anyone can make a cryptocurrency or NFT project, rug pulls are common in web 3 investing"
18,"Security and Safety against Scammers (part 3)

Ultimately, if you have a cold storage wallet and don’t give out your seed phrase, your assets will remain safe"
21,"Never respond to emails asking for any of your information, especially your seed phrase. 

There have been instances where people get emails from fake Ledger email addresses and give away their seed phrase. 

No company including ledger should ask for your seed phrase"
22,"Also, beware of fake websites or emails! 

People can use very similar email addresses and create legitimate looking websites

The best thing to do is bookmark official sites  so you never connect your wallet to fake websites that looks real"
23,"Cryptic Investing will never reach out to you asking for personal information or to message us

Be sure to report any account you see doing this!!

Aside from getting verified, there’s nothing we can do to stop this from happening, so always be cautious"
24,We’ve experienced a crazy amount of fake accounts in our comments or even accounts posting our content and reaching out to people pretending to be us

31,"You will need your seed phrase to connect your assets to a new ledger if you lose yours. 

Again, NEVER share your seed phrase or type it in anywhere on your computer or phone. 

The best thing to do is write it on a piece of paper and secure it somewhere that isn’t your home"
32,"In the instance a hacker gets access to your seed phrase, they have access to your assets

Keep in mind that your assets aren’t stored on the physical cold storage wallet, so losing your device doesn’t mean your assets are gone."
33,"Once you get your cold storage hardware wallet, it's important to NEVER share your seed phrase with anyone. 

This is how you’ll recover your assets if you lose your physical cold storage wallet"
34,"Here at @crypticinvest, we recommend using a Ledger Nano X (Buy directly from https://t.co/cuXz0qCfbD site)"
35,"While you might be fully reimbursed in fiat, your digital assets are gone forever!

To start your security journey, the most important thing to have is a cold storage hardware wallet.
This will make sure that none of your assets can be transferred without your authorization"
36,"While there is some insurance for crypto assets, most won’t cover security mistakes you make.

It's also not safe to keep your crypto on exchanges because they can be hacked"
37,"In the crypto space, there are no bailouts if your assets are hacked and/or stolen!

This is because crypto is decentralized, censorship resistant, and private. The power of full ownership comes with responsibility as well as risk"

This will revolutionize gaming and how many perceive it.

We can already see games like Roblox priming the younger generation for using this social and technical structure."
41,"NFTs will be the building blocks of the metaverse because clothes, items, and even the land in the games will be owned by the users. 

Imagine playing GTA, and all of your items in that game could be sold on a market for real money (Apartment, cars, helicopters)."
42,"Gaming is already a $2 trillion sector, 
but as more play to earn games come out, we will see this sector growing exponentially over the next few years."
43,"But with the new “play to earn” model being introduced by blockchain games, gaming will be an important part of many Web 3 metaverse worlds and their economy."

In fact, some may argue that games like GTA, Roblox, and Fortnite are considered Web 2.0 metaverses."

Your skills actually might be more valuable in the metaverse."

Thousands of people may see said businesses in the metaverse, allowing for faster upscaling– without the expenses of renting out an office space or building."
52,"With this being said, many people have found it easier to work from home and don’t see the need to be in an office. 

Alternatively, companies will be creating offices within the metaverse where their employees can interact with co-workers, attend meetings and socialize."
53,"Events, conferences, and meetings all took place from video calls. Schools &amp; institutions moved classes online and to hybrid modalities.

And some with transferable skills saw remote work become not only possible, but permanent."
54,"While furloughs and layoffs contributed to halting of work, many other workers were deemed essential and operated under new protocols to contain COVID exposure."

Eventually, socializing in the metaverse will be as seamless as opening twitter and joining a Spaces discussion."

Certain NFTs that people identify as will become a status symbol in the metaverse, similar to follower counts &amp; verification status.

72,"So why would anyone want to spend time in the metaverse instead of real life? Well, data shows that ~1/3rd of our lives (~8 hrs/day) is spent watching TV, playing games, or on social media

Whether you are aware of it or not, we already spend a lot of time detached from reality."
