4,@PtiteAngele @wonkless1 @symp_bodies See? You are a splendor of a human being and of a friend. You are a role model. Am so grateful to have you in my life 🥰😘💖🌺
5,"@wonkless1 @PtiteAngele @symp_bodies So let's do that!! I sincerely owe you so much Wonk. I know you're gonna say no; but I know how I owe you. THANK YOU MY BEST CRYPTHOMIE ⭐️🙏🫂❤️ One day, don't say no again, I'll repay all this to you. Every possible way."
6,"@MagdaGangsta Am like you IRL, my work is internationally published, collected... and coming here is very intimidating. Especially since IRL, I didn't do much to promote myself coz am SO BAD at it
 I worked tirelessly, but it's easier to be seen than here. So yes, you moved me a lot🫂💙🙏⭐️"
7,"@PtiteAngele @wonkless1 @symp_bodies Awwww thank you my Angie!!! I hope my tweet didn't sound rude or entitled, asking boldly like this. It wasn't my intention at all! 
So yes... each with different animation &amp; alterations, I can make small series of the same sculpt making them more affordable. THANK YOU MY LOVE❤️🌺"
8,@PtiteAngele @withFND https://t.co/IjbaSn9mUS
9,"@wonkless1 @PtiteAngele @symp_bodies AGREED. Rotations are an excellent idea. It's planned for my next ones! 
So maybe little series of a few for one sculpt, each being different; could be a good idea... THANK YOU ❤️🫂🙏"
10,"@wonkless1 You're the kindestest (now, that's a word.) I felt so bad afterwards thinking I could be rude or arrogant entitled to ask just like this! THANK YOU 🫂🫂🫂🫂❤️"
11,"@MagdaGangsta Love you too so much 💙🫂
Your words about me... seriously... https://t.co/4MvtyZrq0f"
12,@naehrstff_nft @opensea Wishing you a radiant day Flo! You're the kindest 💙

15,"@wonkless1 Fun eh my crypthomie?! 😃🫂❤️
I took the liberty to tag your name in an idea related post; don't feel any obligation to answer! I'm afraid it was a bit rude to ask such thing... am so sorry"
16,"My #NFTCommunity, I had that idea in order to make my 1/1 #NFTs sculpts easier to acquire, a series of videos where I alter them so each will be unique much more affordable. Yay or nay? I'd love a brutally honest opinion here. 🙏🖤 @wonkless1 @PtiteAngele @symp_bodies maybe? https://t.co/mLQ4elt93p"
17,Because Tito is extravagantly talented and a radiant human being. Give him love and share and sales #nftcollectors ! 🫂🙏💫❤️ https://t.co/iUCI9NncPT
18,"@NudeYogaGirl It's rude, gross and none of their business!"
19,@PtiteAngele @withFND Gm to you splendor 💖🥰😘🌺💖🥰😘🌺💖😘🥰🌺
20,"@thetitanborn Still in the process of understanding what works in the space for 1/1 artists.
I'd rather sculpt all day... but I have to figure out what to do here in order to succeed since it's so different from IRL art market am used to."
21,"@NFTherder @Pixelmon That kinda shit, is the most despairing events that makes 1/1 very hard working artists with real art background, cry and wanna quit cause nobody sees us and we male quality art to pay our household bills. 
It's a stick in the heart for us."
22,"@nftfreaks Very true. Very discouraging. Hard to avoid it when we just start here.
And sometimes, even legit shill posts feel like we can never be seen on them cause they are so flooded..."

25,@opensea Working on my physi sculpts #NFTs and listed them on #opensea 😊🖤 https://t.co/ycoQBPlDh4 https://t.co/zQPZOsRyLS
26,@nftfreaks I feel it since 18 years and it's gonna last forever. It IS horrendously exhausting and draining.
27,@SanndyCreationz @SuperRare Me either! We're like an exclusive club 🤣
28,@ColorTherapies Gm to you! Indeed that works too for some of them 😉
29,@jf_nft Take care of yourself and see a doctor if needed. Wish you a speedy recovery 🫂🤍
30,Gm my crypthomies! Fight your demons or domesticate them. But never let them win. In our space FUD is a demon to fight. I do it thanks to the support of my frens. That's why #NFTs &amp; being an #NFTartist is such a great thing! My Demon sculpt #nft 👇https://t.co/Swrs6C4EgY https://t.co/asEMqAOLIp
31,@PtiteAngele @lilzidesigns But you are SO GOOD. That's what makes you perfect. Most definitely. ❤️😘🥰🫂
32,"@PtiteAngele I had a very bad day... then I shake up and try to move forward despite the issues. And I have to say, my frens @Lazychartape and @wonkless1 saved my day. 😘🥰😘🥰😘🥰😘🥰😘🥰😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
33,"@PtiteAngele @lilzidesigns I love you.
So fucking much.
You should be a role model for masses. Seriously. You are what the world needs right now."
34,@Tito_Merello Gm Tito! 😊❤️
35,@PtiteAngele @lilzidesigns 💖🌺💖🌺💖🌺💖🌺💖 we need so many more people like you my Angie 🫂❤️
36,"@lilzidesigns Oh no. I have one of my closest friend being Russian and living in Russia. They FULLY understand and they are against that war for the most of them.
They get arrested &amp; jailed for protesting it but they do it anyway.
And they'll be starving soon so they're suffering &amp; hating this"

You're the bestest in the world 🫂🫂🫂🫂🫂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
40,"@wonkless1 @AnaScripcariu13 I can rotate the camera around it, which is far better!"
41,"@wonkless1 @AnaScripcariu13 THIS! 
Now these are expensive (100, bottom price.) BUUT just the kinda skate part of it, can be found for 30 bucks. And taking a selfie stick and making one of my infamous MacGyver trick, I can sorta build one!!
So no fugly rotating stand. Lol
If anyone looks for these : AMAZON https://t.co/kW8a07VbyK"
42,"@wonkless1 @AnaScripcariu13 I NEED A MINI DOLLY!! That's what they call it. It's like a skateboard... hold on. Show you a pic! BRB! (Could maybe be useful to someone else, so I share.)"
43,"@AnaScripcariu13 Omg you are so kind and understanding 🫂❤️
I think the same. I don't mind hugging guys or for them to hug me if they need. I think it's one of the most comforting tool of humanity, everyone should have one when needed."
44,@wonkless1 @AnaScripcariu13 You're so so much the best 💖🫂😭😭 https://t.co/j8uxQ0EMDL
45,"@wonkless1 @AnaScripcariu13 It's seriously fugly! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
But I can try. 
I need a rotating motor... going on Google!!"
46,"@AnaScripcariu13 Very wisely said Ana. We do.
Take care of yourself 🫂🙏🤍 (am a girl, the hug isn't creepy stuff.)"
47,"@wonkless1 @AnaScripcariu13 I truly hope so. Many told me my nfts are too pricey. But I can't come here to sell for less than I do IRL while it's doubling my work time. 

I made an """"""""animation""""""""/gif with one of them, but nobody liked it. Now they like... but they want 3D instead. https://t.co/A8Qs9pwjFQ"
48,"@wonkless1 @AnaScripcariu13 Photographs are possible. 
Filming... usually the sculpts are on a rotating stand and I personally hate it... it's so kitsch and ugly. Looks like cakes in the 80's in restaurants (sorry for those doing it, I just don't like it for my work.)
Am gonna try the pics!"
49,"@wonkless1 @AnaScripcariu13 I thought of offering physical for my next pieces. BUT AGAIN, my 1/1 physi sell for equivalent of 2 $ETH sometimes 2.5. 
So the price will again be an issue. 
You're the best ❤️"

52,"@AnaScripcariu13 Omg YES.
I just came today to answer a dear friend's dm, but am offline for now cause I am drained  uninspired, sad, discouraged, fed up... you name it."

54,@Lazychartape @MartaVerse Omg lucky thank you my friend ❤️🫂❤️ https://t.co/ArDeU3hntj
55,"@Lazychartape Thank you ❤️🫂
I got many people asking me if it was 3D, then when I said it was physi sculpts, they said they would have bought if it were 3D. I know we're not very interesting in the art world, especially figurative sculptors. 99.5% of us are never to become recognized artists."
56,"@Lazychartape Hey Lucky my dear friend 🫂❤️
You're too kind ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I never film as I sculpt. I mean I would have so many hours of recording if I did! But I have wip pictures showing the progression of the sculpts for many of them. I have no clue if it would change anything."
57,@MsNftKing1 Thank you so much!

63,"gm frens! I've always known that all art fields aren't so hype on physi sculpts. Sculptures,aren't sought. In 3D yes. In actual clay/stone; nah. I truly hoped it'd be different in #NFTs but no. That's ok. Used to it. Gonna take some time coz am depressed. Am ok. Love you all❤️🫂 https://t.co/rsDLvggQdh"
64,@captain_kimi Omg he is so cute!!!😍😍😍

But I frankly don't think this space is interested in sculptures. Not complaining, we sculptors, know that we have a hard time in every field. We're used to this. Sad but used to. LOL https://t.co/fZie8ZAW3r"

But us, doxxed artists, often IRL professional artists too btw, we struggle for marketing ourselves, A LOT. &amp; when we do, we get such little response that we ofte  feel like we don't belong &amp; no one will ever want us.
We still here but it's discouraging."
