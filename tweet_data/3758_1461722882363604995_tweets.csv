28,@Caden0002 @RealSupDucks One day man one day
29,@karimo714 @TPMwalker @RealSupDucks Yeah that’s the other reason I wasn’t gonna buy rn. I would be copping strictly for the nft feature but it has other features that avid or popular twitter users might like but I don’t have a use for just yet.
30,@TPMwalker @RealSupDucks Yeah nah that wasn’t meant in a negative way towards you or anything haha I’m still deciding if it’s dumb or worth buying. As of rn people can check my wallet if they need proof of ownership 💪

34,@scottburke777 Now we wait for all other social media to fall in line 😈
35,@scottburke777 That is pretty sick! I currently don’t have twitter blue so I didn’t have my account connected and all that setup yet and couldn’t see the feature myself.
36,RT @serenawilliams: GM https://t.co/wADkM3EWsV
37,@scottburke777 Oh so is it already something they are working on/doing or is this just an idea?
38,@scottburke777 Yeah I’m hoping for a feature like that that will prevent someone from using someone else’s nft (verified collection or not). That would be the best solution imo
39,All I know is if I see any random account posing with someone’s @RealSupDucks as their pfp with this new twitter feature they better be careful. The flock gonna want all the smoke!
40,I fully understand why they didn’t btw. I can just see problems arising from both sides of the argument

88,@sneezzaa I agree! I haven't sold any of my crypto since I started buying in 2018 😎
89,"Personally, I believe that it is more likely younger, less experienced investors. However, I do know some people who have older relatives that have invested in NFTs and were very stressed about their investment because the concept is still somewhat unfamiliar to them."
90,Do you guys think it is generally older or younger people that are listing something for a loss within the day they buy it?
