24,"@benedictevans @sriramk assume each user only stores first order actions like ""i follow x"" and ""i liked y""

25,"@benedictevans @sriramk good point.

invisible signals like viewing time may be proprietary to each client, but this might be ""good enough"" for a recommendation system."
26,"@benedictevans @sriramk The data layer of our network is, as you point out, spiritually similar to RSS with cryptographic signatures to improve security.

43,"This tricks @opensea and @etherscan into showing them as legitimate ""Mint"" Events, and unsuspecting users may ape into these fake NFT's.

Expect these attacks to become more common, always be careful when buying new NFT's!"
44,"So the contract creator can mint the same token to the same people, again and again, generating thousands of events.

Which they do here:  https://t.co/JvPlkvRTIq"
45,"The flipped ape contract exploits this to trick users. It emits a transfer event when a new token is minted, just like the ERC-721 spec says. 

But it doesn't implement the logic to prevent the same token from being minted again."
46,"This standard is called ERC-721, and it defines the functions (the ABI) and a set of rules for how they should work (the logic).

It's very easy to check if a contract complies with the ABI, but hard to check if it complies with the logic."
47,"All NFT contracts implement the same ABI, which makes writing NFT apps easy.

If you write code that checks for transfers from one NFT contract, it will work just fine when pointed at another. That's how @etherscan and @opensea can easily track all NFT's."
48,"So to talk to a compiled smart contract, you need the source code. Or at least enough of it to know the names and shapes of the functions in the bytecode. 

This stripped down version of the source is called an ABI."
49,"Ethereum smart contracts expose functions to read or write on-chain data. 

They're written in human-readable Solidity but are compiled into very efficient byte code before being deployed. 

The downside of byte code is that it's not readable."
