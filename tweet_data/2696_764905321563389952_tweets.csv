3,"Act Ethically

Web3 is still the wild west - bad actors run amok and there's no authority to protect you

protect yourself and uphold a high ethical standard in all that you do

make ethicality the expectation"
4,"Pounce on Opportunity

work like a lion, not a cow

pursue opportunities judiciously and relentlessly

most don't last forever - make the best ones count

create your own luck"
5,"Protect your Focus

everyone is vying for your attention

time is the most valuable resource so protect it fiercely

understand the game, understand the value of focus

ignore the carrot, hold your own stick"
6,"Keep at It

you're early

again, you're early

Web3 has just begun and every voice matters

build sustainable habits to protect yourself from burnout

don't sacrifice longevity for anything - opportunities are abundant"
7,"Define your Timescale

are you thinking in hours or decades?

use short term wins to enable long term wins

example: flipper → builder"
8,"Avoid the Wrong People

steer clear of negativity, closed-mindedness, pride, fixed ideology, greed, envy

some are better than others at hiding it, but there are always cracks in the armor"
9,"Find the Right People

don't take the journey alone

find a positive-sum community that pushes you to be better

become a sponge and learn more than you thought possible

(S/O @ShinyObjectSC)"
10,"Signal vs Noise

most voices, projects, and trends are noise

uncovering signal is an inexact science with a steep learning curve

optimize consumption, then make the best decisions with the information you have

and don't forget, signal and noise are mutable"
11,"Desired Outcome

always know what you want

lean into what excites you - it can and probably should change frequently

broad examples: community, investment, technology, knowledge, sovereignty

recognize that different outcomes require different behavior"
12,"How to find clarity in Web3

some thoughts after falling down the rabbit hole last year👇"
