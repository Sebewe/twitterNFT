15,@OpenSea (and maybe @LooksRareNFT) do not account for transfer ownership under OpenZeppelin construct. This means the initial contract owner is able to adjust royalties to themself maliciously.
16,"＠Opensea @opensea_support As @BabyCoby_ stated, most NFT collections use OpenZeppelin's owner construct when creating a contract. This comes with some functions including transferOwnership(address newOwner) write (to change owner) and owner() read (to read current owner)."
