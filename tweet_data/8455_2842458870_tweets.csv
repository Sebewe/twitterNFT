3,"Can you find the solution to my puzzle?
Prize: 0.22222222 ETH
https://t.co/63YyUzv307"
4,@chrisdbarnett @TrustlessState @RyanSAdams I am now working for Grid+!
5,@Thisisnottap @superphiz @TrustlessState @RyanSAdams Omg thanks for this lol
6,"Okay @TrustlessState @RyanSAdams, i did it! I got a job in crypto! Please stop yelling at me now!"
7,"3 people have discovered the hidden #POAP in ""Bits""."
8,@erabzzz We had a blast there too!
9,"#BITS #twosday Puzzle
A bit late: 

https://t.co/r2M7PS1reP

I recommend downloading the file."
10,"This is due to OS/Polygon having issues.
This was a really fun puzzle to make and the music is something I am really proud of.
Good Luck, and enjoy!"
11,"Okay.
At 22:22 UTC (37 minutes from this post)
I will be posting the IPFS link to my puzzle, ""BITS"" here.

The prize is 0.222222 ETH, if you originally put in an offer on OS and would like to sweeten the pot, you can send .02 directly to 0x222222222210b99491414E1B4bF6B4dDB33ef3db"
12,@songadaymann Bravo... Really good.
13,"@superphiz But... why? I just imported it to see what it was, How is someone sweeping them instantly like that?"
14,@wizardofhex @superphiz 😂😂
15,His was the address I was using to test the transfer.
16,This looks good for tomorrow! I will try to send them all out tomorrow at the regular time 22:22 UTC.
17,"So, I just sent a Bits puzzle NFT on OS/Polygon and it actually worked. It went to @superphiz, but before anyone thinks this is unfair, you must know he mined the vanity address that holds the prize, if he wanted to solve it.. well his puzzle involves a text file as the only clue"
18,If I can't find something by tomorrow at 8 PM EST I will straight up just post it here for free.
19,"Puzzle is post-poned... again.
However I will be looking for an alternative L2 Minting solution tonight. Hopefully, I will have good news tomorrow.

I apologize for this problem that is not my fault.
It is really very minor in the grand scheme of things though. Be safe everyone."
20,@z3bracoRn @opensea_support @opensea Can you recommend another L2 based NFT platform?
21,"@opensea @0xPolygon Side note, if you can recommend another NFT platform on an L2 I am all microphones! (ears, but I'm a robot, if you missed the joke...)"
22,"Alright, WTF is going on with with @opensea &amp; @0xPolygon ?!
Are we all just collectively ignoring that a major project on an Ethereum sidechain is nonfunctional?
Any info?"
23,"Okay, Opensea/Polygon is still not working.
I am postponing the 2's day puzzle another day.

Let's try again tomorrow at 22:22 UTC.
TWO days late!

If that still doesn't work, I will have to find another way... any suggestions?"
24,"I had intended to say 22:22 UTC* not CST, but yeah, I'm from the worst part of that one country"
25,"okay, in the interest of me not going crazy tonight, let's postpone this (the 2's day puzzle) until tomorrow at 22:22 CST.
I am so sorry for the delay 😟 blame centralized block providers....

29,@poapathon This is a POAP i do not want.
30,@compusophy Pretty dope ngl. I love interactive stuff
31,"I apologize for the 2's day puzzle delay, it depends on Polygon/Opensea to distribute it, and they are having trouble."
32,"@B3Rhunter @0xPolygon What we need as a community are L2 solutions that do not depend on a few people. ZKsync, Optimism, Arbitrum ftw"
33,"@cartar_l Yeah, but with time all things improve, except the things that do not."
34,@cadamstallard @songadaymann the puzzle is actually on my website https://t.co/Scm6kNOxfv :]
35,@superphiz First part of my puzzle challenge: Patience!
36,"Guys, it's so bad. I cannot distribute the puzzle until OpenSea / Polygon are back up."
37,"@opensea What is going on the Polygon NFT transfers right now? I have a project launching at exactly 22:22 UTC and I can't even get a test transaction through...

Any idea when this might be cleared up?"

42,@0xDeion Soo cool!
43,"@bayuuu09548614 I leaned hard into the creative side this time, It is not technical outside of understanding what bits are (0's and 1's, black and white...)
