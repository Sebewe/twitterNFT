26,@jul1keller @worldofwomennft Yes wish I had this mane IRL 😂
27,@ladytron_nft Tough decision and there‘s probably no right answer to this. I guess for me it would all depend on how emotionally attached to the BB I am and if I can identify with the image or if I’m solely hodling expecting an ever higher value increase
28,"Not too many LNLs left before we hit 1 ETH floor. @LongNeckieLady was the second NFT I minted and I'm so excited for @NylaCollection and the entire community! Better keep an eye out🚀

29,@dradriannestone @HollyGShore The most important aspect that got me into this mess is the fact that the hyped projects create lots of urgency and FOMO so one literally starts acting irrationally against one‘s better judgment.
30,@dradriannestone @HollyGShore Yes i guess it‘s more common with the bigger more mainstream projects. But even most of the smaller ones with a quality instead of quantity community give out presale spots so unless it‘s super niche it still doesn‘t hurt to always check secondary sales.
31,@dradriannestone @HollyGShore Normally when there‘s a genuine hype around a project there‘s more demand than supply and most nfts are minted through presale spots. So while minting happens you‘d already see a fair amount of secondary sales on OS from those who didn‘t make it to the ps list.

37,@channygal33 Such great tips! Thanks for your insights!
38,"@channygal33 Very good tip! Another thing I learned is to regularly take a step back from Twitter and the NFT space. It helps not to fall into the frenzy, keep a clear head and thus make better decisions."
39,@damedoteth So sorry you have to deal with that. 💖 Know there‘s so many ppl by your side in web3
40,Thank you everyone 🙏🏽 Your kind replies are really lifting me up!
41,@HollyGShore Thx! And you‘re definitely right! If only one person remembers this tweet before falling for a similar scam it was already worth it 💪
42,"@maiteazarov How nice of you, really appreciate it! I think the best way to help is let ppl know below their tweet that it‘s a scam so nobody else falls for it."
43,@Gail_Force_Wins Thx for your kind words!
44,"5/5 And the moral of this story...
👉Don't let greed drive your actions
👉Always DYOR: check website, team, hang out in the discord to get a sense of the community etc.
👉Don't let professional looks and high follower/member numbers fool you  
👉Listen to your gut feeling #WAGMI"
45,"4/5 But since I was driven by greed alone and not a true interest in the project, I didn't (want to) see the signs and kept telling myself that a quick flip would enable me to invest in more ethical/female-led collections and thus benefit the ""good"" projects."
46,"3/5 Only seconds after I came to my senses and realized sth was wrong. No activity on OS, very few mints despite ppl (bots) saying otherwise in general chat. I went to the website: project team fake and no links to socials etc. It had been so obvious the whole time..."
