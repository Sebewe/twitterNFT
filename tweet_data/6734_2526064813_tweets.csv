78,"7.) Long term Bored Ape holders were already rewarded because you can count the Mutants if held as contributing to double the potential $APE token.

8.) A movie about Mutant Apes would do better than a movie about Bored Apes."
79,"5.) Many MAYC owners have held longer than new BAYC owners that bought their Ape in the past month.

6.) Total BAYC volume traded is 300k ETH and MAYC is catching up at 176k ETH. MAYC will likely pass BAYC at this rate."
80,"1.) It would be unfair when people are spending upwards of $400k buying Mutants. Some MAYC's are selling higher than the BAYC floor. 

2.) ape = ape. 

3.) Mutants comprise of 66.69% of the ape community, aka the majority.

4.) The top three highest sales have been Mutants."
