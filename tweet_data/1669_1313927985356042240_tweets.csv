31,"@DanWhitCongress raised moderate right im still rather moderate, tho I don’t consider myself right or left. At the end of the day it comes down to a healthy mix of both values. The right seems more int in economic policy while the left seems more int in social policy. Both are important."
32,@AndrewSteinwold @SolonDeFi has the answer.

50,"@NFTTaxGuy If he continues to push I can see the markets going down further, but when the dust all settles I believe its a very slim chance Russia doesnt recover. The timeframe of recovery depends entirely on how far they push this conflict."
51,@NFTTaxGuy I think whether putin will give up is irrelevant. I dont think Russia will ever cease to exist.

65,"@DFSDannyYewYew I can def see big names having stealth alt accounts though. I mean think about it, if garyvee follows a project people look at that and take it as a green light. Safer to have an alt for things like that."
66,"Ive been getting followed by accounts with like 40 followers, but their followers are big accounts? Are they alts? You don’t need to spy on me."
67,"Bullish on projects with doxxed founders, 0$ marketing budgets, and organic growth."
68,@weednelious @InvsbleFriends Yeah imagine if @4UFoundation_ got this kind of hype. They’d feed &gt;10 million kids in minutes.
69,@LazyDr01dStudio @InvsbleFriends I wish. I wouldve sold immediately for 10+
70,People said I was a hater when I said @InvsbleFriends would be 4-5 ETH post reveal. Well who’s hating now?
71,@Helloimmorgan Can we talk about more good NFT projects? Like uhh idk @4UFoundation_ 100% charity minting in 2 weeks?

79,Putin and zelenskyy should just box for it.
80,@NFTsAreNice Who are these people minting @Pixelmon cause I need them to mint @4UFoundation_ 100% charity project to feed 10mil kids.
81,"@TheCryptoCPA What do you think about this fundraiser @andrwwang did. My concern is that a partnership was essentially formed and sales will be income. Even if 100% is donated, the partners might not get full benefit. Would be better to do through a public charity like @4UFoundation_"
82,"Floor is so thin on these, and has been holding strong at/above mint. Plus theyre gorgeous. Was an easy buy for me. NFA DYOR. https://t.co/vQBDXOXsOR"
83,"@andrwwang @BitcoinBaddiez Andrew I understand the project was pulled together practically overnight, but if/when you do another. Please consult me. Free. Im a CPA and have some tax concerns. I also have a tax exempt charity @4UFoundation_ we can use to funnel funds. Would love your support on that as well"
84,"@AhhBo @reli3fxyz @4UFoundation_ @andrwwang Well I am a CPA, so I guess have a unique perspective. But yes, many HNW people consider tax effects when donating. If you dont, you can get hit with capital gains, and not be able to claim your deduction."
85,"@sxtvik No hate here. Its incredibly admirable. My only concern is that the way it was set up seems to invite wasted funds through lost gas, limited mint, and taxable events that take away from the end goal. It’s too late now, but if you want to do another charity proj, @4UFoundation_"
86,@Crypto__Jesus_ @VitalikButerin tweeted not to send any eth there because it could be hacked. The $1mm raised from relief is still sitting in the contract. Im so torn rn because I want to help but I dont want to blindly support what could be bad actors. Can we just airdrop every acct in Ukr 1eth
87,Very hard to discern the legitimate from the illegitimate when you cant even trust verified accounts to be providing accurate information. https://t.co/BBotHhnsvo
88,"@AhhBo @reli3fxyz @4UFoundation_ @andrwwang Of course we all want to help, but there are regulations. Im concerned a good portion of this money raised will be considered taxable income because it was not done through a charity. Im concerned many triggered taxable events that takes money away from efforts."
89,@sxtvik @reli3fxyz Really wish I could have helped on this. I and a few others have been working on charity NFTs and have set up a 501c3 @4UFoundation_ to make the mint fee tax deductible. Love what you guys were able to do in a short 24 hours but damn I wish I was able to get your attention sooner
90,@reli3fxyz Again just trying to point out that @4UFoundation_ has been working on 100% charity NFT solutions including making then tax deductible to the donor. Would love to work with @andrwwang and the rest of the team on the next one. Tried to get involved in this but went unheard.
91,"@andrwwang @andrwwang if you want to do this again but in a better way, @4UFoundation_ has set up a charity so that mint fees can be considered tax deductible donations. Im a CPA and a dev. Would have loved to help you out on this but unfortunately my comments fell on deaf ears."
92,Super proud of @andrwwang for doing what he did. I just wish we had the same level of influence because @4UFoundation_ has been working on charity NFTs done right for months now. I hope we see this same kind of support come March 15th. https://t.co/S74kwYIAJt
