48,"@BurnTheEgo @THANVEERKRISHN1 @BAYC2745 Roger that mate, you keep doing you - just saying discord is not the devil."
49,@BurnTheEgo @THANVEERKRISHN1 @BAYC2745 I agree that spaces are an additional method to communicate. But it won't ever replace announcements and important pinned notifs etc. Not everyone has the time to trawl through a manuscript or listen to a recording in order to be updated.
50,"@BurnTheEgo @THANVEERKRISHN1 @BAYC2745 I have regular notifications daily from multiple discords about other compromised projects, users communicating fake listings and verifying links etc. I respect your choice not to be on there, but peddling the narrative that it's all bad isn't the answer."
51,@BurnTheEgo @THANVEERKRISHN1 @BAYC2745 I'd argue not being in the discord poses it's own risks as well.
52,"@BurnTheEgo @THANVEERKRISHN1 @BAYC2745 It adds an attack vector - but MM is the first wallet most new protocols will add for accessibility and discord itself is an exceptional platform to communicate, network and socialize. And it is also usually the go to method teams use to communicate with their community."
53,"@BurnTheEgo @THANVEERKRISHN1 @BAYC2745 Discord and MM are safe to use mate. 

Discord: Treat every DM as if it's a scam. Do not click unofficial links.

MM: Revoke all allowances. Always check what you are signing. 

99% in fact likely 100% of compromises involve 'human error'."
