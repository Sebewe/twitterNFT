Although we didn’t work with a traditional ad agency I’d be remiss not to mention the creative firm we worked with who actually created the ad, commissioned the song, got the clearances etc etc. Honestly, felt like we were all one team so I didn’t fully realize it, thank you!"
2,"11/
I'm still new to marketing, but “Do things that you think are funny or awesome even if people tell you it won’t work” seems like reasonable advice so far."
3,"10/
I guess if there is a lesson here it is that constraints breed creativity, and that as founders you can empower your team to break the rules on marketing because you're not trying to impress your peers at AdWeek or wherever. No ad agency would have done this ad."
4,"9/ 
- they finally agreed and it turned out great - our team did an amazing job pulling this off last minute (and of course the production budget was tiny, less then $100k)"
5,"8/
- submitted the ad for approval and got a lot of pushback on whether we could run it at all, i won't get into details here but it required some special meetings, indemnity etc"
6,"7/ 
- since we were almost out of time we decided to just make the whole ad a QR code
- team came up with the DVD screensaver theme, and commissioned a cool song from Com Truise (whose music I like)"
7,"6/ 
- this was partially inspired by Reddit’s superb owl commercial at previous super bowl, key insight was if you can only flash something on screen for a moment people will google it later - how do we get them from TV to phone to convert"
8,"5/
- we were running short of time (a few weeks), and one of the original ideas we had included putting a QR code at the end"
9,"4/
- so we went back and brainstormed, came up with a bunch of wild ideas (some of these we will do down the road, but didn’t have enough time to produce - think Apple 1984, some crypto native stuff, etc)"
10,"3/ 
- side note: it never made sense to me why I should like a product because a famous person got paid to say they like it"
11,"2/
- we bought it not knowing what we would do
- initially an outside agency pitched us a bunch of standard super bowl ad ideas
- I didn't like any of them (standard super bowl ads tend to be gimmicky, celebrity cameo driven, going for a laugh etc)"
12,"1/ Some folks asked for details of how our super bowl ad came to be, here is the quick back story..."

29,"5/ Lastly, I think the book misses an important transition to Bitcoin as a new reserve currency which is a very real possibility. The coming competition may be between the centralized East vs the decentralized West (powered by Bitcoin), to borrow a phrase from @balajis."
30,4/ The book does a great job highlighting the differences between the two superpowers in a way that I think is not often discussed. Hopefully this greats more empathy and moves beyond simple narratives.
31,3/ He then looks at America and makes a clear eyed case that it is in decline since ~1970 while China is on the rise. Of course none of this is inevitable. The course of either country can be changed if we have the will.
32,"2/ He looks at the decline of a number of empires historically, tracking each country across key metrics (education, innovation, military, etc)."

90,"I don't think crypto is anywhere near this end stage though. We are still seeing a lot of new technology and players enter the space. It's not ""already centralized"" as much as it is ""still using some web2 components""."
91,I do agree that all networks tend toward centralization over time. Great book on this https://t.co/4Y07wANw4b
92,"As a result, there are a lot of ""hybrid"" web2/web3 apps during this phase of web3 development. That doesn't mean the overall trend is bad though. I think it's great that more and more web3/decentralized technologies are being developed."
93,"General thoughts: It's still difficult to build things in a decentralized way (nascent tools), so you are seeing various apps/companies revert to using more centralized web2 techniques when they run into a hairy technical problem."
94,4. There are more options than Infura and Alchemy. Access to simple blockchain data will be relatively commoditized. Which is good for decentralization.
95,"If a platform is merely a proxy to data it doesn't own, and it turns evil, people will switch. Not owning the data counts for a lot."
96,3. I agree there is an overall move toward using platforms. But there is a big difference between using a platform that also owns all the data also (web2) and a platform that is merely a proxy to decentralized data (web3).
97,"2. I agree with the overall point that clients don't behave like full nodes. However, there has been quite a bit of discussion about ""light clients"" in the crypto community even going back to the early days of Bitcoin/Ethereum, so i wouldn't say it hasn't been an area of focus."
98,"1. For NFTs, some keep their data in IPFS (decentralized file storage) or in the smart contract itself for procedurally generated images. We (as a community) should probably move more to solutions like this over time, since it is indeed more decentralized to build them that way."
