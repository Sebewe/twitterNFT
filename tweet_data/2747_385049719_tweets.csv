18,@pokermonfacenft @TheAlienBoyNFT I wonder what project from around that time accepted that offer
19,@KeyboardMonkey3 No one wants to face the reality of what this has turned into. You’ve been keeping it real recently and I like that

22,So it’s bad to have a class 1 horse in Zed Run?
23,@LoganOP_gm I’ll tune in for sure
24,@EcsZed Ultra light beam
25,@LoganOP_gm @kzolson19 Haha unsure about that one
26,@kzolson19 @LoganOP_gm I like that. Stake to earn tokens and you can bid on pulls with your token to try and win that card?
27,@LoganOP_gm Holders vote on packs to buy/open
28,@LoganOP_gm Yeah nothing immediately comes to mind for me. Maybe BoxBreakDAO? Lol use DAO funds to purchase boosters and all profits are returned to DAO funds
29,@LoganOP_gm I think that’s the biggest missing piece right now
30,@LoganOP_gm I think at worst it’s something fun to do. No clue what the level of interest is. What do you have in mind for adding NFT type stuff to it?
31,@LoganOP_gm Love opening packs. Just cracked open a yugioh box with some friends yesterday

79,@KeepinItGutta @pokermonfacenft I can understand that. I look at it as adding different styles for people to enter. Say you don’t like og alien boy art. They now have Doogles and girls both with a completely different and slightly different style respectively
80,@KeepinItGutta @pokermonfacenft @xLAF_nft @TheAlienBoyNFT I’m kinda confused here. Are you okay with the amount of projects gcg has created for their holders? Is this not a similar situation?
