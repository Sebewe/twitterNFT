33,@NFTCheetah Definitely thinking it pumps like you said but I’m keeping an eye on some projects to see if they dip so I can buy in 🙂
34,"@NFTCheetah Could there possibly be a dip instead? All listings will be delisted except those from Feb 18-25th, which are recent listings. Recent listings are usually at floor and old listings are above floor

People re listing their old listings could possibly undercut floor?"

97,"@FlysAlpha I had 6 ETH before the weekend 🤣 now down to right around 1 ETH but a few of the ones I bought this weekend I’m looking to take profits soon so hopefully more liquid soon 

I just wish I could get to around 15 ETH liquid at one point 😩"
98,"Cashed out my initial invests into NFTs plus 3xprofit. Now the liquid I have + every NFT that I own I’m free rolling and hope to turn into much more. 

I always like to buy 3 and sell 1 or 2 to get my investment back and free roll the other.

Think it’s time to go bigger."
