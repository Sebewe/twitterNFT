29,@EskayNFT @Ramin_delgato @Syberer @cr0ssETH @BAYC2745 @psychedelic_nft 99% of projects will fail. Those that are run as a business will have a chance at being around 2 years from now. Time will tell.
30,@Ramin_delgato @Syberer @cr0ssETH @BAYC2745 @psychedelic_nft Successful projects don’t take a % of mint and distribute to founders &amp; team. They pay the founders &amp; team a salary and possibly a dividend in the future based on growth.
