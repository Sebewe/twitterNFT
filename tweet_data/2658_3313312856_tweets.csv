71,"A block explorer allows you to search for any address or transaction on a blockchain, but it is read-only 📖 - it cannot execute any transaction on your behalf."
72,"You may think of a block explorer as both a blockchain search engine 🔍 and a read-only bank account 🏦

A search engine like Google allows you to search for any piece of data on the internet 🌐, while a bank account allows you to view your own balance and transaction history."
73,"Although you may view your address and its token holdings from a block explorer, the explorer does NOT 🙅 hold or manage the tokens inside your address or any other addresses on the blockchain. 

Block explorers also do NOT 🙅 handle or process transactions."
74,"A block explorer gathers this info, decodes it and displays it in legible form 📖

When you view an address's token balance, transaction history or analytics, you are actually viewing an indexed version of that data 🧐 from the blockchain about that particular address."
75,"What is a block explorer? 🧑‍🎓

Public blockchains are transparent and decentralized. Anyone in the world may see every transaction, every address and every token on the blockchain... But! This data is not readily accessible or understandable for the casual user."
