Why do brands like @atari @adidasoriginals @stonercatstv keep using outdated contracts and not working with people in the industry on better ways to drop?

All that money wasted in transaction fees could have stayed in the ecosystem https://t.co/iPYNc62ALU"

Our next version is going to put it to shame tho"
18,@MisterMoonOG @YogaNFT @AckerlandJay @TripVoxel @dezknoph @Funee_Munee @BitBotSociety @FierceStudioNFT @PoodleDunks Depends on how the contract is written. Ours are usually .2-.4... if you have contact presale you're looking 2e-15 depending on the number of addresses
19,"@MisterMoonOG @YogaNFT @AckerlandJay @TripVoxel @dezknoph @Funee_Munee @BitBotSociety @FierceStudioNFT was minting for under $10 the other day

@PoodleDunks was 5 for $22 I believe was the lowest we've made happen

Our next contract will be even lower!"
