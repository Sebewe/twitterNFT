56,@tokenstate i think we need to take the best out of what we have seen and iterate. The idea of PCV in protocols like Aave is very sound (in fact it was natively implemented in Aave V2)not only for token holders having a treasury backing the token value but also to have more competitive rates

69,"@freddycoen @jeremytwei @transmissions11 @MartinLundfall In general, if you follow the open/closed or dependency injection principle, you will end up with modules that can be at design time embodied either in external contracts or libraries, depending on the specific architecture requirements"
70,"@indvs3 @StefMoore69 @wilkinson_chris @dom_theriault @OttawaPolice i ""did not comply like an idiot"". I did my research, studied the data, concluded that covid is objectively way riskier and dangerous than the vaccine, and faced the lesser danger. Maybe you should do the same before calling other people idiots, cause you look like one otherwise."
71,@indvs3 @StefMoore69 @wilkinson_chris @dom_theriault @OttawaPolice you might have missed the fact that 80% of the people is going on with their life already. You could just get the goddamn vaccine and moving on as well.
