26,@PSchwarzenegger @iiiitsandrea @drinkperfy It doesn’t. But I’m also not gonna run ads against the free trial. It’s a way to convert potential customers who abandoned checkout or cart on full cases. My 4th email in abandon cart is “what could I have done to win your business?” If they say too much $$ I offer trial pack.
27,@dennishegstad Look on opensea. There’s tons of people sellling below floor.
28,@iiiitsandrea @KevinEscalera @PSchwarzenegger Lol sorry. It’s the old Quest Nutrition in me. 🤣
29,@iiiitsandrea @PSchwarzenegger @drinkperfy Thank you. That was huge for sure! I learned a lot real quick. We didn’t have a fitted box for trial packs and used paper instead of bubble wrap. Fixed that for launch and 86’d the last remaining trial packs from pre-launch. 🙏
30,Our official LAUNCH launch is tomorrow!!! Can’t wait to start this…finally! https://t.co/Q1DAu0J6Mj
31,@KevinEscalera @PSchwarzenegger @iiiitsandrea Chill https://t.co/sU2dJRIrts
32,@PSchwarzenegger @iiiitsandrea @drinkperfy (4/n) the trial after launch is similar to trials on Shopify apps. After 14 days it converts to subscription unless modified or cancelled. We are clear about that up front in the checkout process. If 20% convert to subscription it’s a win. If 40% convert to subscription it’s 🎉
33,@PSchwarzenegger @iiiitsandrea @drinkperfy (3/n) I got lucky with the liquid on our first trial production. Rather than throw it away I was able to make use of it. So it didn’t hurt to have cans in hands.
34,@PSchwarzenegger @iiiitsandrea @drinkperfy (2/n) also I was able to get hundreds of people to try Perfy before the real launch (tomorrow) which allows me to build social proof. After tomorrow the trial pack will be a tool for abandon carts or last ditch efforts to convert. It won’t be an acquisition strategy/downsell.
35,@PSchwarzenegger @iiiitsandrea (1/n) I’ll keep you posted. I doubled Outer Aisle’s subscription revenue last year to well past 7 figures with it. It’s not liquid so shipping is much cheaper. With @drinkperfy I’m $5-$8 in the hole per trial pack. It’s a price I’m more comfortable with than a $30$-45 CAC.

38,Perfy’s merch will only be available to its NFT holders and past purchasers. Only way to get it if you haven’t bought Perfy before is at Salvation Army in 2037. Some items will be available after the 5th purchase. Some after the 7th. After 10 you get free shipping for life.
