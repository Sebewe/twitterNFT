5,Is this confirmed it’s going to Elon… omg https://t.co/AG3ENd0YPi
6,@BoredAper Heck yea boredaper
7,Is this Elon’s entrance to NFT’s? If so WAGMI https://t.co/rZXf4hmxbe
8,Prayers up for Ukraine 🙏
9,Worth the read. Point 2 is something that needs to be done :) https://t.co/XZHfP769nH
10,"""its going down, i'm yellin timber"" - Ke$ha never felt so relevant 😂"
11,@jjpplll Ya hate losses tho HAHAHA
12,"I have a lot of respect for projects that mint below 0.1Eth. It shows me the founders know value comes from the project and the holders, not from how much money they can raise from minting."
13,So epic LFGGG https://t.co/8MwMs8XhqT
14,@jjpplll @adidasoriginals Wagmi 😤😤😎
15,Honestly getting in on this because I’m a loser 😂😎 https://t.co/qAxgnGgYpu
16,"@adidasoriginals ITM announcement “what happens in phase 4 and beyond: we hear you. And we’re building. Phase 4 isn’t the end of ITM, it’s the key to a brave new world”. I’m hyped for what’s coming this year for adidas 🔥🔥"

19,"woulda been cool to see the Gutter Cat Gang to snipe this collab too, but nonetheless--cool cats still cool"
20,We've seen Adidas NFT and Nike NFT develop huge value. Now Puma x @coolcatsnft. Is this really not interesting anyone?
21,Another mega mutant tomorrow LFGGG. I’m so excited to see what it will be.
22,I didn’t mint my looks labs WL because no liquidity and now with these posts I’m getting fomo 😭 dang it.
23,"I’ve seen mf’ers, cats, azuki LOL. Also the irony is that the color on my PFP is the same as the 0x background smh 😂😂"
24,"Instead of how derivatives were like reworking the artwork, now derivatives just copy the art, add 0x and make money on the minting 😂. There is no shame anymore"
25,@PixlitEth It’s such a balance—honestly I don’t even know how it would be done. Too much centralization = too much control. Too little = we can’t make people do the objectively right thing
26,"it makes me so sad what is happening with some people's NFT's :( hang in there we have some dark days, and some bright days together."
27,@Nate_Rivers im so sorry man this is so sad :(
28,waking up to a three day weekend FEELS SO AMAZING LFG
29,geez adidas NFT really touching in at 1.75E rn 😱 when their road map gets released its gunna be crazy
30,"Nike RTFKT is going crazy right now, but i still have a feeling adidas also gets the space too and how to create value to hodlers. Waiting for their road map and ITS GUNNA GO CRAZY."
31,HAPPY FRIGGIN FRIDAY LFGGG. MADE IT TO THE WEEKEND. Whatcha gunna do this weekend?
32,@dividebyzeroeth yeah average that bad boy down
33,@PixlitEth you are a 5 head ser
34,@dividebyzeroeth dang coach i respect it tho
35,I've been trying to stick with my guts more in NFT (for better or worse) and its telling me to put a bag into $LOOKS. Isn't conviction what separates the good from the great?
36,"No FUD to the cool cats, but bummed that pets get no milk. Ima start the game broke with no milk and all the cool cats will have nice evolved pets. #NoPetLeftBehind?"
37,I purchased my address because TOGETHER WAGMI was a common sentiment for the space. Everyone wanted to make it together. Now I feel so many NFT projects that are just trying to pump/dump without building each other up. Stay safe in this space and don’t lose yourselves 🙏 #wagmi
38,Yo also what the heck almost got 3k followers 🥴 together wagmi !?!?!?!?!? THANKS FOR ALL THE FOLLOWS FAM IM BLOWN AWAY.

45,"Things like squiggles make me so sad in the NFT space. But I do strongly believe the bad apples will fall away and it will be clear the only way to make it will be through true hard work and real building 💪. Never forget, WAGMI together"

51,"Been stressed all morning, flew to Texas for work, worked til 8PM and my Uber eats just delivered Canes chicken tenders when my meeting ended. Now eating in my boxers and listening to Twitter spaces. Best feeling ever 😫🔥😍"
52,I am so excited because we all signed up and we are getting so much value from just being holders!!! THIS IS SO HYPE. WAGMI BABYYYY. https://t.co/Pb0i3gnFlS
53,HELP FRENS. I am going to try one of my first public mints for the cool pets. How much GWAI do you think i need to set to get it? Anyone have an idea of how likely it will be I can get it too?
54,"Soooo I get to mint the @punkscomic, but not sure which cover I wanna get. How are you guys deciding?"
