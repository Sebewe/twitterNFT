21,"@rebel083 Visually I wanted a good variety of teams, so I picked 1 of each character (then 5 extra). Was trying not to get too many similar traits. Also wanted a good spread levels wise so the competition would be interesting. Too many people nominated teams with high levels."
22,"After a few last minute relegations, the 24 teams competing in the inaugural Non-Fungible Sports season have been chosen. Thanks to all the people that nominated, sorry if your team didn't make the cut, there's always next season.
