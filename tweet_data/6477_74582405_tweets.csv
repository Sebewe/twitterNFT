2,Looking for the balance of self love and narcissism has taught me this: narcissism isn’t hyping yourself too much. It’s hyping yourself exclusively.

6,I don’t know anything about Russian  or Ukrainian soldiers. But it’s crazy to me that today we *still* have young kids willing to kill each other because old men told them to.
7,It’s difficult to really express how hard I’ve worked to get to this point. But I’d like to. Soon I’ll be sharing some process peeks. But man… What a journey. https://t.co/eIr6jeyYMw

10,sometimes developing these tarot cards for @the_well_co project can be really an intense and overwhelming experience. Sometimes I remember I'm literally spending full days drawing swords and stuff. What is my life rn. https://t.co/uBbhUR1s0n

26,@Zeneca_33 So lucky you got @emileevee_eth. We were super bummed to lose her from our project! She's gonna do great things for you I'm sure of it.
27,Anyone else notice that artists who are defiant against NFTs are pushing their physical art sales extra hard rn? That makes me happy. I'm gonna buy some. I want artists to win.
28,@the_well_co @MysticSisNFT @okayb3x But seriously @ParisHilton let me give you a tarot reading plz.
29,@the_well_co @MysticSisNFT @okayb3x It always starts well intentioned then devolves into a collective manifestation ritual for Paris to notice us or someone’s dating app habits get put on blast.
30,"@emileevee_eth @StephSutto @_simone_simone @KiraHodgson2 @entropyeq_ BUMP. @entropyeq_ is talented, eager and full of heart."
31,Anyone who complains that crypto or NFTs “aren’t real.” Are begging me to drag them into a convo on the nature of reality that will either change someone’s life or cost friendships or both.
32,Mysticism is exploring the immaterial. And web3 is the immaterial world of our own making. People who are confused about a hermit mystic like me being here don’t seem to understand that.
33,"Web3 is NOT going to be a utopia. But if you can let go of that, and focus, I really think your little corner of it can be."

40,@emileevee_eth I’m in her DMs begging her to work with me we are not the same.
41,Also it’s sometimes taking drugs when you make stuff.
42,@emileevee_eth Why wait
43,Conscious creativity isn’t taking drugs when you make stuff. It’s knowing that making stuff is the same exact experience as taking drugs. You either see God or you see every single way your parents went wrong with you. Or both.
44,@allseeeth Either we’ve been getting an incredibly discounted rate or there’s a terrifying invoice on the horizon

67,I just broke personal records for how long I’ve ever done tarot readings for and learned a lot! Humbled by the vulnerability and openness of the people who let me draw cards for them. Kisses. This project means the world to me
