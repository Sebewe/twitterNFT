80,@Rb430Cool I know kinda surprised. At one point it was 700 I think during the peak fud
81,@HunchoCat Crazy right. I wonder what would happen if the team announced the game is good to go in a few hours. Listings will probably drop below 100
82,@chxppeth I don’t think we’ll see them at 1.4 again ha. Hopefully soon 🤞
83,@chxppeth Loaded up. Wish I could get more

96,@LeTiger46 Hey bro. Check dm
97,@binokrisvaldy @3landersNFT Is this a shill? I don’t see anything about merch lol
98,@acowboyname @649Speedy That’s the thing. People don’t want to wait while other projects are pumping. That’s the game. Dip is only temporary. Even myself I will probably sell in the next pump and wait for the game to be running smoothly then buy back in
99,@649Speedy @acowboyname Probably will tbh
