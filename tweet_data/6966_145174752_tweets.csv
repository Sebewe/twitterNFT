1,@ajcartel_17 @Saitamaguru1 All the people crying and threatening to leave are going to be tweeting that they wished they loaded up when the price was at 0.000000015
2,I am relieved the swap is delayed another day. I have been trying to get more liquidity to load up. Who wants to buy my rare lazy lion?

14,People crying because Saitamask swap isn't live yet. I'm here panicking to get as much liquidity as possible to load up before this next run. Bout to get parabolic in here. #SaitamaWolfPack #Saitama

24,I think @the_x2y2 built a great marketplace. Doing a great job fixing bugs and creating utility. Not so great on developing sustainable tokenomics. Devs please do something

44,Do you guys like the UI for X2Y2? I personally like it better than opensea
45,@SoCryptoPoor @heat_rig This is clearly the next blue chip
46,@StikTheDip @LooksRareNFT Seem possible @LooksRareNFT ?? That would be a helpful feature.
47,@StikTheDip @LooksRareNFT The idea is that you can bid on multiple items with the weth you have available. That's why they have a bid collection option. If you had 1 weth you could bid on an entire 10K collection offering 1weth for each item and first come first serve as far as people accepting.

59,@CryptoFinally Which NFTs are you girls buying
60,If you’re in Saitama or want to be then stop focusing on the fact the price is down and start worrying about how you can accumulate as much as possible. If everyone is gonna win it can’t all be at the same time. Buy low sell high.
61,@AltcoinSupreme @JohnLmoon @MRS_SaitamaGuru Never invest more than you can lose! Also you only realize a loss of you sell. When you buy a solid project your now holding a ticket. All you have to do is wait for your turn and it will come. Give it a few months
62,@JakeGagain @MFWeingarten @SuperlativeApes Good entry point Jake! Big month with serums coming up and also staking.
63,@artbyviki I’m bullish on lasagna
64,@CryptoFinally Shift your confidence in wealth to confidence in yourself
65,@InuSaitama @Saitamaguru1 @MaxEquation @mannythehitman @kleingabriel @ElonMansur @Ntran1234 This is much appreciated transparency. I recently got my cousin and his wife into crypto and they went for Saitama. They tried to buy a $500 bag on Saitamask and only ended up with $100 worth. Is that due to the bots? Will that issue ever be corrected or does that become a loss?
66,@crystalhefner Thanks for following me back! I mean you haven’t yet… I just haven’t flexed my lazy lion yet. You wanna know what rarity rank 54 looks like?
67,@ActedBridge0x0 Amazing thank you. Do you sign when you list or after someone wants to buy i?
