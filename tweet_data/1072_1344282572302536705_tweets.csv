34,"@MarkTheHabibi @props Well, it’s awesome to work with you and people like you who lead us to these concepts. Total blue ocean, we can build whatever we want together. How cool is that"
35,"@KalebsCode @WoodiesNFT Haha it’s a long shot, or is it? https://t.co/Xrovm46Ckv"
36,@props Props powers instant reveals
37,RT @props: best to like your NFT’s art or you’ll hate it when you realize everyone else in the Discord does too.
38,"@Obrownson @props Amazing, thanks for the vote of confidence 🌳💚"

60,"@boycottvillage And worse, neither the collector nor the project itself really understand what the finish line looks like to even meet those expectations."
61,@JLukevich @boycottvillage Castaway because they’re an island of resources yet inhabitants must fend for themselves
62,"@Rhynotic @props There will be announcement in the near term, but for now we should sync up because Vulcan looks super valuable to support pieces of the vision, maybe we could partner up?"
63,"The goal for pfp projects is clear, but I’m convinced there only a few of us that see what it is. When we unleash our partner projects to manifest this vision in the next 90 days, it will become incredibly obvious to everyone in the space."
64,@maalavidaaa @safehaven__hq Really cool
65,@looks_HQ @WhatsWeb3 @mondoggg @LooksRareNFT Piss off scam bot
66,"@WhatsWeb3 @mondoggg @LooksRareNFT It’s a centralized US business, it’s highly unlikely they’ll issue a token until the SEC allows for it."
67,"@WhatsWeb3 @mondoggg @LooksRareNFT I’m thinking long term, as folks realize that centralized marketplaces ain’t it. The incentive model of decentralized fee redistribution is too great for centralized markets to win, the question is when."

75,@Hxden https://t.co/zeHB74sD83
76,@GutterDoug_ @props Thank you for saying so!
77,"Bet on teams, not hype. If @props’ vision comes to fruition, rarity won’t matter either, so long as you have skin in the game."
78,@artnome @zouassi
79,@mysavagedogs Undervalued
80,"@Space_Invada @mondoggg @LooksRareNFT Stakers do get their $looks compounded but your share of the fees is based on your proportion of the staking pool. Definitely wish I would have bought at $1 instead of $3.50-$4 but my investment horizon was essentially forever anyways, have no intention of ever unstaking."
81,"@Space_Invada @mondoggg @LooksRareNFT It’s paid in WETH based on fees collected on the platform, not the price of looks."
82,@prgsv1 @WoodiesNFT Hope you all are having a great time!
83,@craigrozynski Yeah mon
84,"@sketchbydad Definitely empathize. This is a great community and when I need to disconnect, I miss it too."

90,@ewanthelobster @mysavagedogs Totally agree
91,"@robmon2 Right, and good for these teams/venues too - growing access to top tier experiences makes new fans for life."
92,@mondoggg @LooksRareNFT 100k
93,@mondoggg @LooksRareNFT Right? I’m making $600/day staking regardless of what the price of $looks is. So bullish.
94,Imagine how disruptive season ticket memberships are about to be. https://t.co/ok2NKUDtEW
95,@TheTick3t @Pixelmon Did you get some playing time with those seats? Sheesh that’s close
