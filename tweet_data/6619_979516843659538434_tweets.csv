3,"I fck with average everyday people

Because there’s nothing average about having everyday staying power.

Often, the “above average” people you see in the distance don’t have true staying power up close.

That’s why they’re actually in the distance.

It’s where their power lives."
4,"When #web3 gaming platforms make the content creation process as frictionless as possible for creators it’ll be resources spent on second, third, fourth move marketing.

There’s the obvious ad spend of today.

And then there’s the not so obvious self-sustaining machine strategy."

7,I love me some $WRLD https://t.co/FFSRGZO2co
8,"Regular people dominate on TikTok.

They outperform big companies w/ big budgets. In being the consumer, they’re closest to how the consumer thinks.

This is why #Web3 gaming has me excited. 

Especially a platform like @nftworldsNFT where the people can create their own games."
9,"@AngelsDevilsNFT @NFTWorldsBot @nftworldsNFT Wow this look amazing, love how you put the video together. Very engaging. Excited to see what you do"

12,"Everything’s connected but not connected at the same time.

What the difference between a Toyota and a Lexus? Brand, image, feel, upgrades? Mostly interchangeable parts.

The ability to shuffle and misalign or realign is the strength of everything that holds it’s own power. #web3 https://t.co/SZb03r6Pl2"

20,"There’s always a tipping point where originality wins.

It’s usually a ways down the road. But trust me it’s there."
21,"Power is going to start at the ground level.

You think poor people will be fundraising with their time and energy to help some rich dude take more and more than he needs?

They’re going to get theirs first. Because for the first time they “can”.

That’s why #web3 is beautiful."
22,"I use 2-Step Verification to protect what’s mine.

I’m not just talking about keeping my passwords safe. I’m talking about keeping my true desires in check.

Nobody can just tell me what I should be doing. I need to sell myself on it before it has any legs.

It’s saved my life."

31,@WOC_BriRoArt Got that eye 👁 🔥
32,"Don’t buy every #NFT an influencer supports.

Reason:

There’s people holding identical bags. Bags filled with “non-organic” love.

You’re doing yourself and the project a disservice to put them on an artificial pedestal.

Love for things are lost FAST 💨 when not genuine.

Watch"
33,"#NFT Infrastructure

@nftworldsNFT isn’t competing with PFP projects. It’s building a platform for them to utilize. There’s nothing “wrong” with having a lack of utility in your NFT project so long as you partner with a platform that unlocks utility to your IP/Brand/Community https://t.co/9cXBZBpZPU"

42,"I have a Newton’s cradle outlook on tech and design.

Eventually, given the sophistication behind HQ creations the world will use similar AI and software. Traditional beauty will blend in and look plastic.

I say nah. I say hang tf on.

Good sht can happen when you keep your eyes open.

Stay solid."
45,"@nftworldsNFT That’s a staggeringly eye-opening stat in regards to the type of demand these worlds can anticipate once in-game content is being created around their projects.

52,"$0 Mint price …
$0 in paid promotions …

👆 rare to see in #web3 with so much money to be made.

Holding your project to an “organic momentum standard” is going to be the play in the future. There’ll be content creators that make a living poking holes in manipulative projects. https://t.co/kU2CgojyTT"
53,"Of course

People use hate as a deleveraging mechanism. Same reason they rationalize why their irrationality is fair.

It’s all narratives at play.

And it’s especially hard to love others when you don’t love yourself.

Especially easy to hate others when you hate yourself. https://t.co/NjNi4M4GNQ"

Those with a “mine” mentality see you as data first and a human being second.
