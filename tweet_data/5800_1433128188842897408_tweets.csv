4,"Pretty damaging to existing projects that have an established floor and large amount of volume traded. I'm not too sure what feedback they're addressing-- who even ASKED to be limited? lmao

Maybe a cash grab with paid tiers in the future for larger collections, that's my guess. https://t.co/F3x2N45Hl1"

6,Why is it that in 2022 I can only see repos I have invites to through a curl command instead of in a page on the website somewhere?
7,"@BrianHHough Yup haha, it requires you to think differently sometimes since angular is 2 way data binding and react is meant to be 1 way. Lots of headaches from async dependency management if you're working with a microservice front-end too."
8,@BrianHHough Had to do angular to react recently for work. Definitely huge hurdles and every codebase is different. Lots to learn for sure!
