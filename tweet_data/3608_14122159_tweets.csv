33,@Richchimp @ayo25192406 @dynamodoh @CLTguy_ETH @CryptoMories @iwwon_official @sadsigns_ I don't think your fudding I just think you're not seeing the long game we are playing
34,@Richchimp @ayo25192406 @dynamodoh @CLTguy_ETH @CryptoMories @iwwon_official @sadsigns_ I disagree NWO undercuts floor mories but could you argue that point with an example? I want to know all perspectives.
35,"@Richchimp @ayo25192406 @dynamodoh @CLTguy_ETH @CryptoMories @iwwon_official @sadsigns_ I agree it can be overdone if there isn't a plan and a team to deliver. NWO didn't dilute mories because they are in a very different price points and utility. NWO appeals as art, and a stepping stone into the famorie. Mories appeals for the community and utility. diff buyers."
36,@Richchimp @ayo25192406 @dynamodoh @CLTguy_ETH @CryptoMories @iwwon_official @sadsigns_ fair enough. We'll see if it works. I think that attrition of holders is a natural process. You then replace those paper hands with diamond ones. Then the cycle repeats. The only ones upset about NWO are paper hands.
37,@Richchimp @ayo25192406 @dynamodoh @CLTguy_ETH @CryptoMories @iwwon_official @sadsigns_ So all those folks with NWO will be looking to upgrade to mories then those mories will upgrade to Samos. We're creating a market for your Morie. I think your assessment of NFT market dynamics is flawed.
38,@Richchimp @CLTguy_ETH @ayo25192406 @dynamodoh @CryptoMories @iwwon_official @sadsigns_ @GIToadz beep boop beep boop

41,@Richchimp @ayo25192406 @dynamodoh @CLTguy_ETH @CryptoMories @iwwon_official @sadsigns_ There are less than 1 million people with wallets on Opensea. Seeing this as problem is NGMI thinking.
42,@ayo25192406 @CLTguy_ETH @CryptoMories But NWO won't get you access to free unlimited therapy sessions.
43,"@Richchimp @CLTguy_ETH @CryptoMories @iwwon_official You prove a point that number of collections doesn't matter because, collections are dropping all the time that interest famorie. Fishy Fam, chubbykaiju, etc. why not have a price point for everyone wanting to say in the iwwon universe?"
44,@N0Liv3sMatt3r @CLTguy_ETH @CryptoMories The floor price is not what you should look at. Look for the projects with the highest number of awesome community members. Famorie is blue chip in this regard.
45,@LugoonNFT @CryptoMories Thanks! minted this guy and fell in love with him myself.

50,"@Ledger_Support Ok, I just made up something about a cracked screen and got to that prompt. It would be a good idea to put under ""other"" something like ""none of these"" to get to a ticket submission."
51,@Ledger_Support How do I get past the bot in the help chat? I need to submit a ticket not related to any of the choices.
52,#FaMorie @SquishiverseNFT and @quirkiesnft pre-mint today if you are interested.
53,"There are thousands of NFTs to choose from. The scarcity isn’t the NFT. It’s just the access key to where the value resides. The community, the utility, the vision. That is what is scarce. The future of web3 will belong to those projects with these qualities. #famorie"
54,I think the combination of professionalism of the team members and the artistic and creative genius of @iwwon_official puts @CryptoMories in  perfect position to be the next big bluechip #FaMorie

60,@0x_eLCrypto @CryptoMories @Coinbase_NFT Not yet. Legalities still being ironed out.
61,@OffToLaunch If abuse is not disincentivized enough by just owning or staking your Morie. Imagine a world where playing a game earns you a token that you can then use to pay for your healthcare.
62,@0x_eLCrypto @CryptoMories @Coinbase_NFT Cryptomories is funding access to a mental healthcare app that provides unlimited teletherapy and coaching services to Morie holders. Paid for by the community via auction of treasury mories.
63,@OffToLaunch @CryptoMories @Coinbase_NFT B. Honest users. Valid point. just like insurance copays reduce abuse by creating a disincentive. Owning an asset that you are taking advantage of hurts your own investment. You are incentivized to be an honest player. Similar to proof of stake.
64,@OffToLaunch @CryptoMories @Coinbase_NFT 2. Two points to address here. A. Profitability is not the right word. But the premise can self sustain itself with an endowment of well managed funds. Think staking and LP yield. $3mil at ~7% would fund this in perpetuity.
65,"@OffToLaunch @CryptoMories @Coinbase_NFT Valid point, 1. Social change starts with someone taking the first step. I believe offering access to mental healthcare through ownership of an NFT starts this paradigm shift. We may not be the David to topple goliath but we will fire the first shot."
66,I believe @CryptoMories is model for how mutual insurance companies will raise capital in the future. NFTs are the policy and the trading fees pay for the benefits. We will disrupt industries everywhere #FaMorie #Cyptomories @Coinbase_NFT

72,@sparktwain_eth Metamask has nothing to do with your trezor. MM isn't on the trezor. The trezor just houses the key. you can get a new exact key buy why wouldn't you change the lock too? there is a key out there missing!
73,@sparktwain_eth but yes if you use the same seed phrase your MM will be like nothing happened
74,@sparktwain_eth why go through the trouble of a cold wallet to reduce it's security by reusing a seed phrase that is on a lost trezor. You see what I'm saying?
75,"@sparktwain_eth I wouldn't do this, just for safety reasons. Small chance that someone has your trezor and know your pin. You need to turn it hot and get a new trezor with a new seed phrase and pay the money to transfer."
76,@sparktwain_eth if you lose your trezor you have to just turn it into a hot wallet at that point. do need your trezor seed phrase
77,There are so many people still out there that don't know about our awesome community. I'm going to work my ass of to change that #Famorie #CryptoMories

82,@CryptoMories providing access to mental health services through ownership of an NFT is going to revolutionize on how all benefits are provided to you in the future #Famorie #CryptoMories
