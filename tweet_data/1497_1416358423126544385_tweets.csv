1,"@Mnewbis @the_x2y2 Feel ya, I have triple the amount of $X2Y2 that I started, but now it’s worth a third lol"
2,@d3layd Never be bearish on good vibes my friend! Find the real ones in the community and everyday in this space will be fun 🙏🏽
3,"@Mnewbis @the_x2y2 Oh no, did you buy?"
4,"@thelgndryizzy @Fangnamstyle @FangGangNFT That’s the joys of NFTs, you don’t get sentimental over stocks or $coins the same way.

FYI I also love FangGang, here’s my guy https://t.co/oMdip9hbAC"
5,"@thelgndryizzy @Fangnamstyle Absolutely, also inexperienced investors investing hefty sums of $ in a illiquid asset that generates more emotional connection than most investment options

I think we see a lot of sweeping in-factual statements by people that are both emotionally and financially over-invested"
6,"@Fangnamstyle You’re a wise man, I knew we were friends for a reason!"
7,"@Fangnamstyle Not every project is going to immediately be a blue chip, but does not mean they’re not a solid project. We getting far too loose with terms such as BlueChip, Rug etc sometimes things can be successful or not successful without falling into either category!"

12,"@coldpizza_eth @alloutofeth Agree, like we should feel honoured for them to have our eth and wait blindly to get what was promised in return.

If anything, I think we need to hold founders more accountable so we don’t get more bull like Pixelmon"
13,@d3layd You’ll be the first person I call
14,"@coldpizza_eth @alloutofeth I somewhat agree, if founders/creators were a little more patient to begin with, and laid the foundations of their roadmap before trying to get as much $ as quick as possible, these situations would be less frequent"

36,"@ottothepoolboy @FudderVerse You could be right, I also think there is a mixture between people trying to stop bad actors in the space which I am here for (Pixelmon drama). 

But also think there is self proclaimed OGs that have let their ‘status’ get to their head and now give the space a terrible look"

81,@r_rainss @opensea You know what to do @opensea 👀
82,"@terps_eth @the_x2y2 Bro they’re not being excluded, they just aren’t criteria for the airdrop.. if you wanted to use the platform long term you can list whatever you want just like OpenSea.."
83,"@terps_eth @the_x2y2 That’s normal when the claim been closed for this long, been no supply.. don’t get me wrong I don’t necessarily disagree with all your points. However, I think their rationale for claimers is fair, because it’s blatant that 80% of people crying wouldn’t use X2Y2 after claim"
84,"@terps_eth @the_x2y2 I think what they’re trying to do, is weed out the people that have no intention of using the platform and just want to claim the airdrop. And tbh, I don’t blame them cos all I’m seeing on twitter is people acting spoilt that they don’t get their free shit 🤷🏽‍♂️"
85,"@terps_eth @the_x2y2 Then if that’s the case, why do you think they should receive the airdrop if they have no intention of benefiting the platform? 

At least this way, the platform benefits from people attempting to hit the criteria."
86,"@terps_eth @the_x2y2 Also a fair point, but there are several reasons to use the platform that don’t include the hand out.

- low fees
- bulk listing
- free listing cancellations 

If you give people free airdrop without benefiting the platform and they dump it and continue anyway, what good is it?"
87,"@terps_eth @the_x2y2 I hear your point, but they need projects (not blue chips) that do volume to generate fees to reward holders of the airdrop. We are in week one and they need to generate volume numbers. You may not like it, but surely you understand the rationale?"
88,"@terps_eth @the_x2y2 Once again, it’s not 10s of thousands a day. It’s 1eth trading in 24 hours, in a bull market. Most projects that aren’t dead are doing that right now.

Yeah they moved goal posts, but it’s cos people that had no intention of trying to help the platform trying to get free cash"
89,"@terps_eth @the_x2y2 It’s not ‘valuable’ NFTs, it’s NFTs that are actively trading so that they can get real volume on their platform. That is what they need, they definitely don’t need the people just listing their hidden folder because that benefits no one"
90,"@terps_eth @the_x2y2 Maybe so, but it’s a free drop and you’re out in their mentions acting wild entitled. No one owes anyone anything just chill and see how it plays out"
91,@terps_eth @the_x2y2 Bro chill
92,@nftyoungboy @Mladek_eth @the_x2y2 Plenty of ways to accrue tokens without claiming
93,"@Mladek_eth @the_x2y2 So did I, won’t be making that mistake this time"
