7,@iotaboteth @NFTpfpPurchaser Imagine having a 10k mint for each city project. It's limitless!
8,@iotaboteth Yes. Same for places in America. There are real world problems to be solved that are profitable and tangible in this space.
9,@Rickochino Regular is subjective LOL. You mighta had taco bell or white castle before you showed up. Neck like mike tyson
10,"Everyone wants the NFT riches and no one wants the work. @BAYC2745 summed it up when he basically said, if you don't want to work then you shouldn't start an NFT project. WHERE IS THE REAL WORLD APPLICATION FROM THE NFT FUNDS RAISED?"
11,@Rickochino Nope. Because Ima ask you outloud #1 or #2. Then give you the rules of treating my shit like your crush was going to walk in the shitter right after you.
12,"I want an NFT proj to buy a block of bad houses in an ok place. Use those proceeds from Mint to fix up those houses then rent them out, creating value 4 the owners (NFT holders) and area. The NFT is the deed in parts. YKHMICDW $70M!!! I can rebuild a shit ton of neighborhoods."

16,"This is why I'm not tweeting about this war, because despite it being a war it still puts a color on humanity. It seems the humanity of war only matters to people when there is no melanin involved. Even in fear of death, there is still time to be racist. https://t.co/uTUqsTiFjo"

28,"WHEN TO IGNORE THE FLOOR: When your project has a staking mechanism, and nearly all the NFTs are staked, ignore the floor. For example @CBCreepz has 1.7% of there genesis for sale and @FreaksNGuilds has 3.9% of its collection for sale. INSANE. This is time to get in! 
#NFTAdvice https://t.co/5ATzbTnNob"
29,"@brian_armstrong Typical white male ape privilege: Zero acknowledge of wrong doing, Zero accountability, Zero credit to those that did the actual work, oh and ""constraints build creativity"" so much to unpack here on so many levels professionally and personally."
30,"When your project has 67K Discord members, 10K Followers and they panic on mint day and open public mint early and cut your total 8K supply in half in order to sell out day one. RUNNNNN!
#NFTAdvice"
31,"Don't rush to mint or get on WL. We are settling down into a groove in this space and from what I see. The actual value of a project in its first weeks is half mint price. So if you believe in it, mint 1, then after the dip buy several.

36,@TheNTM2430 @psychedelic_nft Don't fall for false security. Rule number one is still click nothing!!! Congrats
37,@Matchainzz @faderjoes @psychedelic_nft We should be able to auction rares like these things off through an auction house that's affiliated with @psychedelic_nft or have the project do it for us for a fee since they have a larger reach.
38,"Stop trying to make it rich by begging for shit, WL, drops, etc. You are programming yourself to do zero work and to always click and react for riches. This is how you get scammed. Keep going around sticking your dick in every hole and you're going to get burned!

40,"@ElectionDayMad1 So your bank was robbed and your money is in the vault, so you put your money in a car and slowly drive it to a new bank...ok."
41,"Users are always getting scammed because they are given something for free WL, airdrop, eth. etc. They don't pay for it with their own 💲. Therefore, they're fast and loose with it and eventually lose it. We are the problem! We are causing them to trust in this system!

42,@klymacks That's called self hype lol.
43,@WasgudNFT But how can we blame Open Sea when the victims clicked something?
44,"If I bought you a coat, that coat ends up on the floor, bed, dirty, LOST, not where it belongs; on a hanger. But if you bought that coat yourself. You would take care of it, keep it clean, make it last. How is it that your NFTs keep getting lost? Who bought it for you?
#NFTAdvice"
45,"NFT word of the day: ACCOUNTABILITY. Stop blaming everyone else when YOU get scammed, YOU had to play a part in it, the biggest part. YOU clicked something, YOU approved something. Stop blaming the tool that facilitated the lie. OS, xyz, discord, email. IT WAS YOU!

69,"To say you'll never be scammed in the NFT space is to say you lack emotions. All scams are emotional plays that feeds your need to belong to a community and to profit. Its an urgency and hype play. We all want to be associated with a winner. U R already a winner!

84,"If you mint any project mint 3 or 4. Sell one during hype to cover initial investment, sell another to fund future mint on another project and hold the rest. With this strategy you never have to add capital ever again (unless you picked a dud)

Ape derivative. 5k WL/7k mint.
Ancemnts wording ""dont be dumb""
Mint was .25 Then change to .15

First AMA Orangie stated he just grad HS.
Mint day only 2500 minted then WL given 2x mint (PANICK)
AMPLE WARNING SIGNS"

94,"@YeZeViL_ @JackedApeClub Then in the first 24 hours your WLers don't mint and you double their mint ability....run. I don't believe it was meant to be a rug, they were in over there heads. They created a huge fitness community and shot themselves with over WLing and mint greed. Shit coulda been awesome"
95,"@YeZeViL_ @JackedApeClub I minted just to sell for profit 5 min later. It was doomed from first AMA when Orangie said he just graduated from HS and bought his teacher PS5 lol.  When 90% reserve for WL, announc start with ""don't be dumb"" and mint price is .25 then .15 and the team pic they were kids. Doom"
