6,"@joshhart @jenkinsthevalet Josh I’ll trade you a bag of cool ranch Doritos, 60mg of edibles, and my ps4 controller for an NFT

If you’re unsure I promise the controller works (r2 is just a little sticky) and the edibles taste like mango. Cool ranch speaks for itself"

42,@nulleth_ I do understand the lack of trust in general hahaha gotta be skeptical in this space
43,@nulleth_ Yes. I’m confused why people were hesitant to begin with. You don’t pay gas or give any token approvals. People worry about Discord too and I don’t get it
