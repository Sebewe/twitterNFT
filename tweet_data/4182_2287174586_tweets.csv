1,"@ablondoodoo I’m honestly fed up of the capitalism vs socialism and whatever talk. They’re the same fucking thing. They always turn into greed and lack of choice. My issue isn’t with a capitalist philosophy, it’s with people with insane power. That exists in all systems"
2,"@ablondoodoo I like capitalism. I don’t like a system where so much money is fed to one person who can then make decisions for entire nations, and is actually encouraged to do so. That’s not capitalism, that’s verging on the complete opposite."

18,"In 2016, Mark Zuckerberg held an experiment. He was replaced by a deep fake of himself. He wanted to test the capabilities of VR and be the first to merge himself with AI. 5 years later, he concluded the experiment a success and decided to roll it out globally. This is Meta."

37,"@TooSmart15 Ah, just read your bio, you're a troll lol"
38,"@TooSmart15 no, but the 'creation' of bitcoin didn't create the coins, it created the ability to create the coins. Satoshi had to mine it too"
39,"@TheJackForge I think I agree about Bitcoin though. I want a decentralized currency so bad, but I think it's gone in a different direction than Satoshi's whitepaper. I also don't believe inflation is always a bad thing (if controlled) so maybe a capped coin isn't a good idea for a currency"
40,"@TheJackForge I also think if the only crypto that is currency is a stablecoin it defeats two of the entire purposes of crypto - inflation avoidance and decentralization. Fiat backed coins are centralized, and they just follow the inflation of whatever it's pegged to"
41,"@TheJackForge I mean, sure, but the only reason altcoins are going to make any money through yield farming is if someone else views it as a utility, and most of those utilities fit into either a currency or store of value"
42,@TooSmart15 no one can generate bitcoin from nothing
43,"@javalist An ‘asset’ can mean anything. Cars are depreciating assets, houses are appreciating assets, gold is a store of value asset. I also think that ofc it’s both, but generally currencies aren’t advised to be used as a store of value, so btc will most likely fall into one main category"
44,Do you think Bitcoin is a currency or a store of value?

51,"@riyaz_ishere yes, blockchain is designed to be censorship resistant. I think it won't only help, but will actually be one of the reasons web3 takes off"
52,social media and centralized regulation has created a world where 'censorship is bad' is a controversial thing to say

55,"Russia just announced their plan to treat cryptocurrencies the same as fiat!

This means:

I have mixed feelings about regulation but I think this is good 🤔

What do you think?"
56,@introvert_rajat A movie about Belfast
57,"@edatweets_ It's probably that people think metaverse = evolution of the web = web3. But even tech news sites talk about Sandbox / Decentraland and Oculus as if they're the same technology, that's what I don't understand"
58,Am I missing something? Is it all of these things? Then why are we saying it's web3? If Meta is the metaverse then is Meta web3? Am I just clueless? Or overthinking? Someone MUST BE ABLE TO TELL ME I am going crazy over here
59,"@riyaz_ishere I wish I could help you but honestly I have no idea what to even give you. This article is probably the best explainer, but it talks about both crypto metaverse projects and big tech as if they're the same thing. I'm SO CONFUSED https://t.co/Ao6LT5wwdX"
60,"I can understand the metaverse being VR/AR, and I can understand it being decentralized ownership &amp; interoperability of tokens. But it just cannot be both. Meta will win the VR scene and if web3 is synonymous to the metaverse then web3 will die. Someone please help me understand"
61,I don't want to argue. I just want someone to explain it to me. How is Nike's purchase of RTFKT (NFT sneakers) similar to Meta's focus on VR? What tf are y'all defining as the metaverse? It isn't crypto or VR because there are metaverse projects doing neither or only 1 of these
62,"I don't understand why people keep talking about the metaverse and web3 as if they're the same thing

Developing a 'metaverse' (the usual definition) is incredibly costly and requires big teams, most likely centralized

It just isn't web3 to me (without NFTs etc) I don't get it"
63,@LuxInABottle it's SO GOOD! although I may be biased seeing as I'm from Belfast haha. highly recommend
64,have you guys seen Belfast yet?
65,@levelsio this is such stupid advice
66,"@Ravjot_ @Brad_Nelson14 Yep, but cost is only a lot because of gas fees. Before gas ENS is like $5 for 5 years"

72,"@uwwgo Yeah it totally is, it's funny because ever since I've started being critical about anything in web3 my twitter growth has slowed down dramatically lol. But this is just the start, it's like anything where people find solace in community/exclusivity, it'll improve imo"
73,"Something I always preach about web3 is the reduction of echo chambers

Internet echo chambers are facilitated by web2 algorithms. Web3 removes this incentive and merges all sorts of people together

This process was never going to be fun, and we're starting to see that 😅"

77,@MickBLang I won't share what he said (find it here) but a big dude at ENS tweeted something offensive in 2016 and doubled down on it. Lots of ppl jumped on cancel culture (I dont agree) but mainly ppl asked what they can do to utilize decentralization which is cool https://t.co/Pkpo31QthG
78,This whole Brantly ordeal has convinced me that no-one on any side of this issue knows what free speech is
79,"@DAppaDanDev yeah! honestly was not expecting that, super interesting poll"
80,"If Brantly’s firing from TNL was put up to a DAO vote, do you think he still would have been fired?"
81,"@Brad_Nelson14 Their project makes web3 more accessible imo, and they’re a good example of a very big DAO. But I’m not sure how decentralized its structure is (ie how much power TNL has). Guess we’ll just have to wait and see"
82,@EricYager3 What is? Web3 or ENS?
83,@GlennLaw_ Excited for this!
84,"@MikeIppolito_ AMAZING thread, this is what I’ve been saying for years. Thank you for putting this together"
85,"@VittoStack @BrantlyMillegan Don’t cancel him or censor him. Let him say what he wants to say, feel the repercussions from the community, and lose a lot of delegations he had for ENS. That’s free speech. That’s decentralisation. That’s motherfucking web3"

88,RT @0xAllen_: Watching many of you behave like a bunch of Web2 lemmings trying to cancel ENS because of the terrible opinions and comments…
89,"Guys, don't boycott ENS

The entire purpose of web3 is that we do not have to trust, rely on, or like any specific person. Let's actually utilize this philosophy and take control of this situation.

Web3 is OURS, not THEIRS"
90,"@agrit_tiwari @dabit3 @VittoStack It drives me up the bloody wall to see this happen. But I have hope. Web3 was born out of a hatred of Big Tech, Big Banks, Big Whatever, and the fight will continue. Regulation won't cut it, we need the people and the people's technology, and I believe we will succeed"
91,@agrit_tiwari @dabit3 @VittoStack Yeah this makes me mad. But it's to be expected. FAANG is directly against web3 and they are currently in control of distribution. Wouldn't even surprise me if Google stopped indexing dapps. For web3 to truly succeed we also need web3 methods of distribution

98,"P2E has been a thing for ages (selling earned items/skins etc for irl money), and it hasn't hugely taken off. Web3 does improve trust and makes it an easier process, but these aren't the reasons that people don't P2E rn. The main reason is: people play games for fun, not money"
