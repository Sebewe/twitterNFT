0,I don’t know why people choose my feed to argue over politics &amp; whose fault things are? We take $ &amp; aid from all parties….being a suffering human being transcends any political party. #bstrong
1,I’m very scared. These poor people not knowing their fate. That’s an unfathomable fear &amp; anxiety…
2,How many homes can @Airbnb donate to #bstrong relocation program? We have 100 case workers dedicated to matching refugees with homes… #bstrong https://t.co/c5z4NdQSmI @GEMmissions
3,Hi
4,CLEAR MANDATE: REFUGEES OUT…AID IN… 🇺🇦 xo #refugeesoutaidin
5,"The first part is the burst &amp; assessing &amp; exhaustion from the hustle… Now the real problem solving, execution &amp; clear logistics happens.  Simply put:  people out….aid in.  The camps are a very temporary damaging solution. People need out. https://t.co/FyHnVGPzEm"
6,Thank our partner @GEMmissions for their endless work on this crusade. https://t.co/1QT6V1QsAY
7,Bstrong has raised 5m dollars in cash for Ukraine. We’ve secured a travel partner &amp; are committing 2m so far to refugee relocation. The 10m in aid will go back into Ukraine. One step at a time. #bstrong @GEMmissions keep donating https://t.co/c5z4NdQSmI
8,"I’m quieter now w updates bc now we’re waist deep in logistics, trucking.shipping &amp; mapping out exactly where in Poland &amp; in Ukraine our aid can be most effective. The refugee camps aren’t sustainable or good for those countries…"
9,YES. https://t.co/Vmjl7IL3yg

11,Special thanks to @LauraVogel You know why xo
12,"Your voice has been heard… bc of your tweets, we have a connection to @ZelenskyyUa to get our aid into the country. Thank You… the fight &amp; solution continues. Keep donating. Xo bethenny.con/bstrong"

14,"WHOA, I was CORRECT!!! We are close to 4 MILLION DOLLARS in DONATIONS to support 🇺🇦 not including the 10m in aid previously discussed. #bstrong @GEMmissions bethenny.con/bstrong"
15,"Pride, fighting for what is yours &amp; what you believe in, never giving up….there are so many messages embedded in this war, to teach our children. It’s David &amp; Goliath. They need the world’s support so this can be the bedtime story for future generations."
16,Bstrong update-one of our expenditures will be on medical supplies. We will have medical &amp; food inside Ukraine by Monday. Keep donating as news turns to Hollywood &amp; fashion. War doesn’t stop for front row seats or red carpets.  😉 https://t.co/c5z4NdQSmI
17,It also feels like people win wars when their heart is in it or when motivated by desire for revenge. Only one side’s heart has been in their cause.
18,"It certainly feels like @KremlinRussia_E has overplayed his hand.  If you’re gonna take your shot, you better not miss."

28,We are going to be donating hundreds of thousands of units of warm clothing to the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 Thanks to my partners at OJG for helping me with one of many critical needs. Xo #bstrong
29,People are beautiful….offering up apartments &amp; many people truly want to help…
30,Please everyone tweet @ZelenskyyUa to make him aware of #bstrong as we are now working w mayor &amp; military in 🇺🇦 but may need more support getting our aid INTO the country.
31,Our newest issues are hunger &amp; medical aid IN 🇺🇦 Ukraine. Now we’re working on logistics back into the country. Everyone is talking about the exodus but keep in mind the millions who stayed. Xo keep donating https://t.co/c5z4NdQSmI @ZelenskyyUa

34,Thanks to @GoyaFoods Europe who is committing to 100k lbs of food donated to #bstrong. Ukraine 🇺🇦 markets have no food so we are coordinating with Ukraine Military to transport aid back into the country for those who’ve stayed. It’s a multi prong effort. Xo We are at $3m donated
35,YES. It’s hard to discuss via limited characters. https://t.co/9N9AxgCO8m
36,One of the biggest issues is that these base camps people r being shuttled to are NOT good for Europe-thousands sleeping in tents. Your $ is helping relocate them &amp; get them out…. It’s a massive influx.
37,BSTRONG UPDATE-we are securing a Poland warehouse to receive &amp; distribute our $10m + containers of aid. Xo https://t.co/c5z4NdQSmI
38,"MJOR UPDATE-NEW INFO-we will be setting up 10 categorized tents, ie:baby, hygiene, travel bc needs r different.Partnering w travel co for relocation.also many want to stay in Poland so we need @Airbnb solutions. KEEP DONATING. Way more refugees today. Xo #bstrong"
39,People waiting 40 hours in a 10 mile line to cross the border. This is a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions. We’re activated &amp; fully organized but not w/o detailed minute to minute strategy &amp; logistics. We’ll continue to need $ to support this crisis seamlessly. Xo

45,The “package” is a survival kit made from donated aid from our warehouse. The $ donated is used to relocate families. Your donations are NOT for survival kits. Those come from our warehouse filled w 16 m in relief supplies. Make sense? https://t.co/dMvtHhsJ6X

86,Waking up to these horrible images from Ukraine is so unsettling. The world has been in a state of unrest for so long &amp; has faced so much struggle these past few years from natural disasters to a pandemic to war…it’s truly defeating.  This is a crisis where I feel helpless.

94,@gayle_cocoa @kanyewest Good one Kennedy. I’ve been there. I’m not supporting him. I’m stating an actual fact.
95,"So the tweeps have spoken &amp; your verdict is marketing + mania.  It seems like a strong &amp; dangerous  combination. For those of you who can hear an opinion other than your own, thanks for the dialogue. For those of you up your own ass, enjoy the view."
96,@AngieJo63181310 @kanyewest It’s a conversation Angie. You can handle it.
97,@MikeyTBH No praise. It all just seems very calculated. I talk all about his bad decisions on my podcast.
98,@DMW9699 I went through hell privately. No one knew what I endured until years later. The two are not related. I don’t own his albums or Yeezys but he has the audience in his palm.
99,So riddle me this…everyone says it’s mental illness bc it’s scary &amp; erratic &amp; abusive…how is it all so intentional &amp; strategic w no aberration when an album drops? Honest not loaded question. Is this not marketing?
