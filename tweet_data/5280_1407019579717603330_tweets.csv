1,@influenceth I love the orbital mechanics. It’s one of the defining features of the game.
2,"@kimmithe1st @strwrsfrk @ProfessorSabre @First_Influence @influenceth I mean, it’s only five seasons, right?"
3,"@strwrsfrk @ProfessorSabre @First_Influence @influenceth Are you picking up a little of the same “different sympathetic factions with different but irreconcilable motivations” style of conflict in my Influence CAs, rather than “good versus evil” style?"
4,"@kimmithe1st @strwrsfrk @ProfessorSabre @First_Influence @influenceth Personally, it’s my all time favourite sci-fi TV series. So yeah, I think it’s good."

12,"@kimmithe1st @strwrsfrk @kingofruos @influenceth @Computerskole @opensea @ProfessorSabre Yeah, scroll all the way back to the beginning of the #coastin-cs channel on the Discord. It mostly happened in there."
13,"@strwrsfrk @kingofruos @kimmithe1st @influenceth @Computerskole @opensea @ProfessorSabre Yeah, I was like, “humans name stuff; this Planet A, B, and C stuff won’t cut it”. Good times.

There was an absolute frenzy of activity in those first few days. That’s how I confirmed my hunch that @influenceth was something special."
14,"@kimmithe1st @influenceth @CHUGGERS14 @StarkWareLtd @ukolodny That’s one of @strwrsfrk’s, actually!"
15,"@kimmithe1st @influenceth @CHUGGERS14 @StarkWareLtd @ukolodny There are five, actually. An airless rocky one like a hot Mercury, one that’s like Venus but actually worse, a big gas giant that creates the Trojan groups, and two ice giants further out. Aion, Bia, Chronos, Dysis, and Eos, respectively."

23,"@influenceth Homeworld 1, probably. Portal 1 &amp; 2, also. I’ve also spent literal decades playing the almost board-game-simple mobile game Slay because it’s one of the most mechanical solid simple quick games I’ve ever played."
24,"@ProfessorSabre @influenceth Haha, and which team did you play as in old school NHL?"

43,"@Razuki_J @influenceth A rarer Cis is less rare than the same rarity of other types. But Cis rocks collectively are more valuable, too. Rarity and utility, both having opposite effects on the value."
44,"@Razuki_J @influenceth Fun fact, almost 40% of Cis types will have guaranteed rarity rolls of Uncommon or better due to the scan bonuses on the first 11,100 rocks, making them automatically the type with the best bonuses for the rest of the game."
45,"A bit of analysis of the big changes in Adalia after just under five frantic hours of the second @influenceth sale. People love the rare mix types, it seems! https://t.co/JlQS1eWWCL"
