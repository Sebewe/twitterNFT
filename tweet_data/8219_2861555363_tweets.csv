1,@jimmieverse Very curious to see a volume chart from the time they posted the donation addresses through the snapshot. Pretty sure there already are some on @DuneAnalytics. I imagine this move will help them raise few thousand more ETH
2,Its a win-win but definitely very odd and unexpected 🤣
3,"This feels weird at first but I think its actually pretty smart. Will undoubtedly help then raise more ETH, and they can just airdrop a “worthless” token - that is, until people provide liquidity and it (maybe) becomes worth something https://t.co/J03W68Ngwa"
4,@BrennerSpear @The_Metagame Very cool!
5,@pugson @rainbowdotme congrats!! excited to see what you do there :)
6,Just deployed my first smart contract on a test network :)
7,@flipdrago You’ve been thinking months ahead this whole time 🧠
8,@xyz @dwr Oh no I wasnt doubting xyz! Love what you guys are doing! The question was specifically about the .xyz TLD’s impact on email deliverability :)
9,"@nicksdjohnson Is there a reason to vote ""abstain"" rather than just not voting?"
10,@dwr @xyz any thoughts on the last part?
11,@NFTann3r Love to see it 👏 congrats!
12,This works too https://t.co/K6TvsvmFYZ

14,Good time to donate some ETH to @Ukraine (address below) https://t.co/vFJXfxnp93
15,"@ValidatorEth good point. the better question would be how does it make you feel in the context of web3 to require an email address. immediately a bit off-putting, or understandable for some use cases (for example, enter a raffle and get notified later if you won)?"
16,you connect your wallet to a website and it asks for your email. the site gives you free access to experiences IRL valued up to $150. what do you do?
17,@mulligan definitely a time saver!
18,@mubootes thanks!

23,@ethleaderboard @ensdomains @PUMA Nice @PUMA 🔥
24,"RT @ethleaderboard: PUMA.eth entered the top 100 most followed Twitter accounts with a @ensdomains name at number 13! 

Welcome @PUMA 🎉"
25,@DawsonBotsford @RoscoKalis @RevokeCash by @ActuallyMentor * :)
26,"@richerd @rtfshl maybe dumb question, but can a malicious signature do harm even if token access has been revoked?"
27,"at the bottom of one of these web3 security threads where the #1 tip is ""don't click links from strangers"", somebody should put a phishing link to mess with the people who still click it. really drive the point home 🤣"
28,@iamDCinvestor thats the plan 🤝

32,"nfts down bad

33,"@intocryptoast IMO (as a current uni student) its more about credentials than education. So as long as crypto jobs dont require the same credentials (which many don’t!!), i think we’re heading in the right direction"
34,"@intocryptoast for people interested in a career in crypto, no. for most, nothing changes (yet)"
35,@damedoteth Do you find it to track NFT sales accurately or are you reviewing each txn 1 by 1? I’ve tried it once and it seemed to be somewhat inaccurate (marked a sold NFT as new ETH deposit instead of profit gain for example)
36,@Crypto__Chicks or just wait to claim until @ETHGasAlerts tweets
37,@Crypto__Chicks tip for anyone claiming: manually set your gas to 40-50 gwei and it will go through when gas drops (may take a few hours). no need to rush. will save you ~$20
38,"@garga888 @Crypto_chickz @NFTs_girl thats a scam account ser. they have 50 followers, be careful. official account just tweeted link to claim https://t.co/XzdomzVsj3"
39,"@the_x2y2 How was OpenSea volume calculated? Is it ETH spent on OpenSea, inclusive of buys and sells, or something else?"
40,@ensdesigner Looks great!
41,"@taytemss Will MM try to connect on each page load in future versions? I always find that kinda annoying vs only prompting connection when necessary or pressing ""Connect"""
42,"RT @taytemss: cool ens update!!!
you can search and view ENS profiles now in an alpha preview of the new manager! 

https://t.co/PwGUX7GRHr…"
43,@taytemss Niiiiceeeeee!!
44,"@phase2pointzero @iamDCinvestor @ensdomains @ethleaderboard If you set gas limit to 40 gwei, renewal for 2 years will cost $25 (cheaper than a .com domain) and should go through within ~12 hours I'm guessing (using @ethgasalerts as reference)"
45,"@iamDCinvestor @ensdomains @ethleaderboard ~2.5k profiles that were previously on https://t.co/rUf67a1zQX have removed .eth from their Twitter name since the drama. There are likely a handful of new accounts that I’m missing right now (will get more data soon), but interesting numbers regardless"
46,"kinda like this from @rpnickson but actually move forward with it (gas would only cost ~3$ per refund if its an ETH transfer, which many fake mint sites are, rather than an actual NFT mint) https://t.co/OJ59OfkKJP"
47,what if someone scammed people via a fake minting website but then unscammed/refunded the ETH with a message that explains how to avoid this in the future
48,"@frolic have seen many of these recently on my tweets too

@DezMeawn 
@Michaelgettys3"
49,Bruno Mars and Coldplay still the best halftime shows
50,@CPGclub Check @ETHGasAlerts for the real gas discounts 😉 been much lower than that over the last few days!
51,@ETHGasAlerts Finally got gasalerts.eth after seeing this alert! Gotta love @ensdomains at just $50 for 2 years
52,@ethleaderboard add @ETHGasAlerts
53,"@tombakker_co @ETHGasAlerts Awesome to hear that, thanks for the feedback :)"
54,@JovianNodes @ETHGasAlerts Happy to hear that :)
55,"WOW 75 poll votes in 5 mins is crazy, must mean a lot of you have notifs on for this account. So glad people find @ETHGasAlerts helpful 😊"
56,@AshwiniDodani @ETHGasAlerts Amazing :) thanks for the feedback!
57,"Currently it tweets when gas is cheap (I update this threshold often) and it hasn’t tweeted in the past 3 hours. “Slow it down” means either only tweet when its VERY cheap, or tweet at more every 4-5 hours"
58,Has @ETHGasAlerts has been tweeting too much?
59,"@davecraige How would you actually get the funds to donate? I assume you'd have to sell a chunk of the supply, which would in turn crash the price of the token. In that case wouldn't a normal ETH fundraiser on @viamirror be more effective than a tradeable token?"
60,For context https://t.co/dcj1w8pqwK
61,Just saw my banner at 29 gwei gas! Feels like we're back in August. Love to see it https://t.co/KzlZtw87Tb

66,"@ValidatorEth @DawsonBotsford @ensdomains Looks somebody registered 888 8's and another did 1100 8's

That's nowhere near #1 at 38894 characters though 😳"
67,"Learned how to use @DuneAnalytics last week and it's amazing for getting data like this super quickly. Essentially made a leaderboard of the longest @ensdomains names in just a few mins!

Findings:
- 150 names have over 50 characters
- Longest .eth name is 38,894 characters 😅 https://t.co/iSxxaroNCu"
68,@DawsonBotsford @ensdomains The one in your tweet is rank 29 :)
69,@DawsonBotsford @ensdomains There are 150 names with over 50 characters! https://t.co/zCClS5yR4M
70,@sat_eth @Uniswap trying to wrap my head around this but i really appreciate the info 🙌
71,@WGMInterfaces Made a mini website where people can check if they made pre-sale while you guys are on much deserved break :) https://t.co/QonNqoaKz1
72,"Can someone explain impermanent loss when providing liquidity to a @Uniswap pool? 

Assuming high volume in x/ETH pair, what happens if x moons? What happens if x crashes? What are my risks beyond price fluctuation?"

74,if you like saving money and cheap gas you should follow @ETHGasAlerts https://t.co/0fxxGe4oFK
75,"@MackPhotoNZ @markdtoth @ElectionDayMad1 @BoredApeYC You can make as many offers as you want as long as you have enough WETH to cover each NFT individually. If one is accepted and the wallet no longer has enough WETH to cover each offer, the outstanding offers will get invalidated"

84,@elonmusk Throwback to when I made a bot that traded doge based on your tweets 😪 pls start tweeting about doge again ser https://t.co/xqS0bN0Iq2
85,@habibiroy Really appreciate that 🙌
86,"@habibiroy ah whoops I forgot about the MM bots, ignore the scam replies"
87,@habibiroy Gas would cost the same as if you were to just send ETH to an address in Metamask btw https://t.co/kk1bsxfirF
88,"@habibiroy No specific goal tbh - mostly done as a personal exercise. But I think it is very convenient and I like that it shows the history of donations made using the website. Also in terms of gas, it supports MATIC on Polygon which has almost 0 gas fees"
89,@PointPaul @WGMInterfaces hahah sadly can't help you out on that one 😅
90,@PointPaul @WGMInterfaces Thanks Paul 🙌
