Y = a car

you can start to think of all the things you need to ""learn"" but really you just need an MVP for a moving vehicle that takes you from point A→B"

70,"@tigeroid noo no doesn't have to be hardware wallet, i just ran out of characters so i just stuck with cold storage wallets

even better with hot wallets, you can have multiple accounts"
71,"17/ want to learn more?

i highly recommend watching this video on the future of youtube NFTs by colin &amp; samir
https://t.co/RgYEfpZILM"
72,"16/ epiphany

you should have ownership of what you create &amp; you sell what you own

these are the ingredients for ecosystems to emerge online, this is what the metaverse is supposed to be

i could be wrong but, doesn’t that sound amazing?"
73,"15/ other options

you should be financially rewarded for the value you bring to social platforms

sure, there’s Patreon for the super fans &amp; a tip-jar on some people’s Twitter profiles, but the social network advertising model is wearing out"
74,"14/ how do we get there?

well, let’s be honest, you’re reading this on Twitter

unless social platforms like @twitter @youtube @tiktok @instagram change their business model, we’ll be stuck here in web2

&amp; there’s a high probability that social networks stay in the realm of web2"
75,"13.1/ what’s a hardware wallet?

”a hardware wallet is a small device that isolates your private keys (your credentials) from the internet, mitigating the risks of your assets being compromised in an online attack.”

https://t.co/wyhp3NwirW"
76,"13/ true ownership

social accounts + hardware wallets = true ownership

the key difference is how we’re authenticating transactions on the server

- web2 is centralized (your credentials exist on a server)
- web3 is decentralized (your credentials can exist on a hardware wallet)"
77,"11/ and the crazy thing is...

you don’t have to own the content to view it!

anybody in the world is free to see it but only 1 person can own it – &amp; the traffic can help increase the value of the content as more people see it"
78,"10/ gamification

if a creator posts good content &amp; you think they’ll continue to do so for X amount of time, you can invest in them by buying a piece of content

the creator gets financial comp from the initial purchase, as well as a small % of secondary sales (typically 2-5%)"
79,"9/ “why would anybody want to buy a video/image/text?”

well - why would anybody buy anything?

our motives to buy commodities include necessity, convenience, fomo, identity, belonging, price, obligation, fear, and happiness"
80,"8/ the commodification of content

what once looked like collecting &amp; trading pfps might look like collecting &amp; trading content

- publishing a video
- posting a photo
- sending a tweet

all 3 should allow you to be financially rewarded for the value you bring to each platform"
81,"7/ “how can i get paid?”

for the web3 people out there, change your view on ""ERC721"" tokens

we’re focused on seeing NFTs as store of financial value — but what about the metadata stored on it? what if you could get paid for posting content?"
82,"6/ a first principles perspective

the underlying issue is the business model

- PLATFORM owns your CONTENT
- PLATFORM can sell your CONTENT

- PLATFORM owns your DATA
- PLATFORM can sell your DATA

you get no financial benefit for putting your time &amp; energy into the system"
83,"5/ but don’t we already have that?

nope!

right now, our attention is the commodity"
84,"4/ a new hope

i’ve been thinking for the past 90 minutes, and i’ve come to the conclusion that we’re entering a new era

ladies &amp; gentlemen i’d like to introduce to you... the commodification of content!

yes! you heard it right folks!

the commodification of content!"
85,"3.1/ watch this video

i would like to explain “surveillance capitalism” to you but i won’t, so definitely watch this video to fully understand what is at risk

https://t.co/Qb5VCWAhch"
86,"3/ financial incentive

every social network is in business of advertising, even twitter! 😯

twitter auctions your data off to the highest bidder, in return for an ad on your feed

you are a commodity"
87,"2/ the web2 social network problem

1. content censorship
2. surveillance capitalism

”surveillance capitalism is an economic system centered around the commodification of personal data with the core purpose of profit-making.” 

- from google"
