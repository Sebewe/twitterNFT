Not only that, but the data suggests it’s nearly impossible to achieve outsized returns on minting purchases without being whitelisted.

More on this here, very good read:

https://t.co/xqlfV9KOv1"
69,"10/12

In fact, OpenSea data shows that users who make the whitelist and later sell their newly-minted NFT gain a profit 75.7% of the time, versus just 20.8% for users who do so without being whitelisted."
70,"9/12

Whitelist.

This is pretty sad, but it’s nearly impossible for an average user to get a good ROI without having a presale spot rn.

These aren’t just my thoughts, but rather statistically proven data."
71,"8/12

@icy_tools 
@nansen_ai 
@Coniunio 

All of these are great for tracking volume, activity, wallets and so on.
Get to know which indicators are bullish and don’t be greedy on spending a buck with these."
72,"7/12

Next to on my list is the valuable skill of getting familiar with various tools.

Don’t forget that even though we are dealing with JPEGS and meme communities, any form of NFT is an investment.
You have to learn how to perceive charts and data."

 Twitter 

The NUMBER 1 tool there is for NFTs.
No rarity tools, no nothing can even compare to the benefits this social media actually provides.

Whether it’s getting into hyped projects early or just general knowledge- twitter is the place to be."
77,"2/12 

First of all, I am not really sure why 99% of youtubers don’t mention this, whether it is lack of actual experience, just creating a video for view farming etc… idk.

I am truly grateful to the 1% credible creators who actually cover this."
78,"1/12
