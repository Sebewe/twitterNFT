2,"I always hear people saying “this will be the next BAYC.” No. That is hopium. There will not be another BAYC or Cool Cats or Doodles etc. 

These projects all set their own respective precedents. This is a red flag if communities/projects use this as a selling point."
3,@seanthebear_eth Happy and broke
4,For the love of god… please do not be left holding the Kevin bag. The attention span of people in this space is less than a goldfish.

12,@TookbyJonathan Literally 🥴
13,@TookbyJonathan IDK what to do 😭🏃🏻‍♀️💨
14,@Zedzies @bears_deluxe Honesty… this may be the most deluxe thing I’ve ever seen.
15,@thaum15nft SHUT UP! How did it go??
16,@TookbyJonathan Not it at all
17,@V1Islandboy Yes... literally that is the point being made here.
18,@V1Islandboy x100 less engagement? Where are you getting your numbers from?
19,@hazer_NFT This is 100% the truth. We are nowhere near ready for mass adoption yet.

21,@Degentraland We’re numb.

This is my frens upcoming project 💙

Can't wait!"

24,@dragaan_v1 Ill take it
25,"@NFTLlama When the developers continue to find ways to keep the community engaged and excited for what’s next. That is such a rare thing for me to see nowadays. Nobody thinks past 3 months with projects anymore. 

@bears_deluxe thinks years ahead."
26,"@Zeneca_33 Why was the calendar sad? 

Because his days are numbered 😆

27,"@Loopifyyy I wholeheartedly agree with this 100%. That being said, how obtainable is a ""fresh reset?"" What does that look like?

28,@DiscoverXnft Cmon you knew it would...
29,@curiousjosh @cocksuckasNFTs @wickedwillysnft Wtf did I just read. And this is literally a copy paste it’s not even like they took some of the info.
30,@PuffYatty @bears_deluxe
31,@yellowcakeinve Literally me 😭😂
32,@PrimalJay15 Yeah absolutely
33,"@Helloimmorgan A true testament on how ""Don't push this bright red blinking button"" turns to I must push the button."
34,@0xZuwu @LUVVVIT From the start I never believed they truly cut ties. It was just to save face and get the communities trust back. We make it too easy as a collective for people to escape accountability.
35,@0xZuwu Don't call me out like that damn
36,This space is not ready for mass adoption yet. I said what I said. Y'all gotta get your act together and then MAYBE we can talk about mass adoption.
37,"If you come into this space and try to apply any sort of logical thinking, you will get rekt. I wish this was not the reality but it is. Developers that are building a sustainable ecosystem for their investors are doing poorly meanwhile copy paste projects hit 5 ETH."
38,@kirkdesoto We are https://t.co/L3l0Km1o00
39,@lovennft This would be amazing 😄♥️
40,@kirkdesoto Indeed. I like you. Wanna be frens?
41,"@kirkdesoto ""Consipracy theorist"" is just a term created to discredit anybody that is a free thinker."
42,@DiscoverXnft Same same
43,@kirkdesoto This New World Order stuff though....
44,@BitBoyJay @bears_deluxe We love the den
45,@CryptoSamurai12 @bears_deluxe Not even a question 😮‍💨
46,@zscuffed Gm
47,Gn frens 💙
48,@PunkieEth Where do I sign up?
49,@0xZuwu 😍😮‍💨
50,@ReggzieD @farokh So true. We have to laugh at ourselves sometimes. People make being offended a personality trait.
51,@PloverStables @farokh WR and DF are the same art though…
52,@anonligator @farokh Right? Everybody has to get all dramatic. It's embarassing.
53,@farokh Did it really offend people though? Damn people can't take a joke anymore...
54,@farokh Chilllll leave Quirkies out of this 😂

57,@kubakurczakII @tokyopunksnft @sabet @CryptoMories @iwwon_official Love this move! Good stuff
58,@metastash @CryptoMories #famorie together stronk https://t.co/0lsfGBqfjy
59,@kirkdesoto This.
60,@0xZuwu @0xQuit Totally agree. Don't even get me started on these mint prices lately.
61,@0xZuwu @0xQuit Totally. IF are cool and all. Not hating on them at all. I just hate seeing people buying in for 10+ ETH and getting rekt.
62,@DiscoverXnft I was telling everyone to sell at 12+ ETH 😭
63,@0xZuwu @0xQuit Same argument can be made for doodles I guess. Doodles are more PFP friendly though 🤷🏻‍♀️
64,@0xZuwu The copium is so sad
65,@rcpreme @bears_deluxe 🖖
66,@TookbyJonathan But like who does this?
67,@kirkdesoto Purple one is my favorite I think 😍
68,@zscuffed Agreed
69,@PaiMei_NFT .22 right now
70,@paddyathia @pxfrens Yours are so sick what the heck
71,@pxfrens Ok.... what the heck mine are so sick! Im in love 😍 https://t.co/7OvvrAWhUq
72,@TookbyJonathan I literally always forget until somebody points them out and both of my arms are covered 😂
73,@NiFTyNate1006 Nooo come hangout im in the den now. We're vibing ♥️
74,@trevor_luckman @bears_deluxe are at 1.14 right now but I promise you they are everything you just mentioned. Come hangout with us for a bit and you'll see that for yourself. We have the hardest working devs in the space.
75,@NiFTyNate1006 Come hangout in the den
76,@b_lewGMI @Dentinmyhead What are you talking about? Nothing that I just said has to do with an NDA. I’m talking about the very obvious play to capitalize on the press that he was getting which is why he rushed out a project within one week.
77,@TookbyJonathan ❤️ we out here. Have a good one!
78,"@Dentinmyhead You went about this in the weirdest way. You left WR and within what? 6 days launched your own project? 

Stuff like that doesn’t fare well in this space. You very clearly wanted to capitalize on the chatter about you before it died out so you would sell out."
79,@PunkieEth https://t.co/xqUEv3bVKO
80,@TookbyJonathan Gm
81,@Nile_Crocodile_ @tmagled Immediately what I thought of
82,"@OGDfarmer I 100% agree with you. That being said, there are newcomers to this space that have not honed their ""rug sense"" yet. And the more this exploitative crap goes on, the more polluted this ecosystem becomes making newbies a target. That doesn't leave a good first impression of web3."

86,@usleepwalker @baronjpg Im so sorry to hear this ♥️ Let us know how we can best support you. Im glad you have crypto in this time of need.
87,"@888XeR0 I mean... here is a perfect example. They made 70 MILLION DOLLARS off of ripping off pre-existing models to give people just enough to mint their crap low-effort project.

https://t.co/QT94CtmAaH"
88,@nftgoodguy Yikes.
89,"Also I want to clarify the ""guarantee of value"" part. There is never a guarantee. We all signed up for that uncertainty when we entered this space. But there are things that can be done on behalf of these ""teams"" to place the project in a beneficial position for it's holders."
90,"It is an insult to our intelligence and our community. I do not care if you think it can make you a little bit of ETH. If we do not do something about it now, it'll never end. This space is already riddled with greedy people who have our worst, yet their best intentions in mind."
91,"And since when do we ever pay loads of ETH up front for a product we have barely even seen and has no guarantee of value? These lazy, rushed, expensive mints from teams with no track record or reputation need to stop. You need to be willing to sacrifice for this anon."
92,"Every single time we buy a project that has MAJOR glaring red flags just for the ""chance it does well"" we are perpetuating the notion that we are an easy target and we are willing to be bent over so some 19 year old kid can make off with millions of our hard-earned money."
93,We need to stop allowing ourselves to be exploited for millions of dollars by teams who are anonymous and therefore cannot be held accountable. This is not to say anon teams are inherently bad but it is a step to ensure that somebody's reputation is on the line if they rugged.
94,RT @zachxbt: So @Pixelmon raised over $70m at 3 ETH per mint just for them to reveal like this. I think it’s fair to say all the buyers wer…
95,@SpeculatorArt This is 90% of NFT projects nowadays. And we allow this to happen by continuing to support irrationally high mint prices and rug pulls with MAJOR red flags.
96,@888XeR0 @bears_deluxe Such a vibe tonight
97,"52 bears just hanging out in alpha VC on a Friday night. The vibes are ✨immaculate✨ over at @bears_deluxe.

Why haven't you joined us yet anon? 🐻🍯🐝"
98,"@zscuffed Cool should I move my bears, mories and gutter rats over too?"
99,@ImliterallyETH I love that for you tbh
