42,"RT @alexia: Web 2: If you build it they will come. 

Web3: If they come, then you build it."
43,"32/ And as much negative publicity as there’s been I have to wonder if the young, unhinged Gigers or O’Bannons or Moebius’ of today, hearing about @TheSpiceDAO might similarly think “huh this is almost certain to fail, but it’s interesting - let’s see if I can help these people”."
44,31/ BUT an attempt to build a Web3 decentralized entity building great art in a decentralized way. That’s inspiring.
45,"30/ The fates are certainly stacked against @TheSpiceDAO’s success - inexperienced management team, no visionary writer-director from day one, messy beginnings with the auction, incredible pressure from publicity"
46,"29/ The earnest chaos, improvisation and hope of @TheSpiceDAO feels like it has a tiny shot at creating something equally bizarre and special as the original unproduced work (although, to be fair - Jodorowsky DID actually get the rights to Dune!)."
47,"28/ Now it’s like “eh, it’ll probably be kinda bland and samey. I’d like to see what a DAO, actually run in a messy bottom up way (as opposed to essentially a well-run corporation just called a DAO), can do."
48,"27/ and I’d venture to say, the competence and clarity might lead to some of the bland corporate sci fi we’ve seen in recent years (or likely worse). Do you feel like I do ? I used to get so excited hearing a sci fi book or comic was going to get adapted by a huge corporation."
49,"25/ Would it really be better if a group of highly competent HBO executives had formed a DAO raised money but essentially just produced things in the normal way? 

It would be a more polished process - but the end result wouldn’t have taught us anything about decentralization…"
50,"24/ But when I stack that against the earnest attempt by people who are not as native to film/TV to try a completely different, decentralized way to create a masterpiece then I personally want to applaud it."
51,"23/ SPICE DAO on the other hand is starting and proceeding in a decentralized way (yes messily and with a lot of direction from the core team). Obvs I’ve seen the very negative reactions making fair points about Dune IP, payment for artists, miscommunication."
52,"22/ In Web3 so much of the brilliant creative work we’ve seen (BAYC, Larva, RTFKT, Sandbox) are built by centralized teams and THEN progressively decentralized. Those teams start in a centralized way with insanely competent core teams running LLCs and progressively decentralize."
53,"21/ There have been few recent examples of bottom up decentralized masterpieces:

Meow Wolf which uses local artists to build each piece of their installations? 

Or the modder Kyle Sommer building DOTA? 

Even those were led by creative visionaries. 

Folks are rightly skeptical"
54,"20/ Any artist hearing that @TheSpiceDAO are going to do a writing competition to create original IP, which will be turned into something by a writer and artists, will be rightly suspicious. Voting on scripts - doesn’t sound promising!

Kubrick didn’t take a poll on his next film"
55,"19/ Or put another way: seeking to answer what to an artist entering Web3 is a huge question. 

“How do you actually MAKE a masterpiece in a decentralized way (rather than simply decentralizing the markets/ownership)”

There are so few examples of art made in a decentralized way."
56,18/ More importantly to the future of Hollywood is that @TheSpiceDAO is doing something that we at @theculturedao are working on too - figuring out how a Web3 Disney/HBO/Pixar might work etc.
57,17/ Making something original that captures the feelings we had watching sci fi or reading Moebius comics as kids seems like a reasonable (very hard!) goal. It doesn’t require IP. As  @thedextriarchy’s article said “Spice DAO doesn’t own Dune —but it doesn’t necessarily need to”
58,16/ The idea of @TheSpiceDAO creating something original inspired by Jodorowsky’s Dune without IP seems valid to me - George Lucas was tremendously inspired by the 50s Serials he grew up with. In Indiana Jones he recaptured how they made him feel - he didn’t directly adapt them.
59,"15/ 3. Laying out a plan to hire professional concept artists, writer, exec producer to help turn that core writing into a series that can be shopped to streamers who would take on the core cost:

https://t.co/boaMQHYGXs"
60,"14/ 2.Starting a writing competition to provide core IP for the DAO:

https://t.co/4zqVejegAo"
61,"13/ Here are the active proposals in Snapshot for votes by DAO members :

1. Compensating a creative team, Roble Ridge, for the work they did very early on creatively but which may be tangential now that the DAO is creating its own core IP:

https://t.co/rr7VuB58Fd"
62,"12/ The core narrative IP will be (if proposal passes) written by members, then taken by professionals and turned into a series package that can be sold to a streamer (in other words streamer takes the production cost, as $3-5m is not enough to create a whole animated series)."
63,"11/ Speaking personally, the way that the DAO is proposing to members (on Snapshot) an original animated series created in a decentralized way is very interesting, and I think would be to anyone who has run a studio and wondered “is there a different way to create good work”."
64,"10/ Members also point out that the running of the DAO is often chaotic and confusing. That seems like a reasonable criticism compared to many more professionally run (often older) DAOs. 

BUT - I also think what is happening points to something truly strange and new."
65,9/ Many point out that the DAO cannot adapt Jodorowsky’s Dune. That’s true. They’ve also pointed out that diving ahead on a TV show without first working out how the physical book will be cared for feels like a bait and switch. Seems like fair criticism. https://t.co/tXrNvyZX3y
66,8/ The core team decided to use Discourse to field proposals as well as to make their own. You can see some proposals here  https://t.co/g7PY86Jk3W
67,7/ The DAO committed itself to: https://t.co/YPJP6bTiaN
68,"6/ $SPICE holders could discuss, debate and vote on what do next in a token gated Discord, and a core team - partly made up of the folks who made the original bids alongside @Sobylife - took over and started the MESSY process of building proposals. 

https://t.co/G35VnDZOJl"
69,"5/  https://t.co/jfzKHyMgK0

After winning the Christie’s auction a DAO was formed to decide what to do next with several million in the treasury (around $7m USD then around $3m now bc of ETH’s drop). 

People who contributed received $SPICE in proportion to their donation."
70,"4/ The auction bid up the price from a guide price of $25,000 to $3m and won. Perhaps there’s gross overpaying, but at the same time perhaps the guide price was low considering the prices of collectibles in 2021 and the $300m movie in theaters at the time."
71,"3/ First, how we got here, as I understand (happy to be corrected). A group including @sobylife and @remiliacorp hosted a @juiceboxETH fundraiser to purchase one of the few copies of the ‘Jodorowsky’s Dune’ book. The Juicebox fundraise brought in $11m worth of ETH (at the time)"
72,"2/ (And yes, I am hesitant to put myself in the firing line as I know so many have legitimate concerns.

I dont think I’ve ever posted a controversial tweet so I’m a bit nervous - just trying to share my own earnest thoughts on why it seems something worthwhile may come of this!)"
