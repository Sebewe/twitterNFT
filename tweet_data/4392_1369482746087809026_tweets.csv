76,"@HVALT00 This has always helped me, from Eleanor Roosevelt:

“You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along. '"
77,@WomenTribe_nfts Good news--thanks.
78,@HVALT00 @psychedelic_nft One day--one moment--at a time. You got this.❤️👊🥰
79,"@HVALT00 You are NOT worthless❤️. The journey to find our true worthiness may just be what we're ALL here for. We all feel this way at times, but when you peek your head above the clouds, even for a moment, and catch a glimpse of your true worthiness, you will see your core, the good.🙏"
