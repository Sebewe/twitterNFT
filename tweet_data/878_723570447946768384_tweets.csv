31,"A lot of people try convincing me that the art of an NFT project isn’t important, rather that the only thing that matters is the team behind/roadmap etc. But to me, saying that is like saying appearance doesn’t matter. Through the art, we define who we are. #nftart #NFTs"

33,"If you are reading this, you are still very early."
34,"The last decade, having a following on social media platforms were equivalent to social status. The will completely change during this decade. NFTs will be your social status. I.e. owning a #BAYC will be equivalent to having +1M followers on IG in 2015, in terms of social status."
35,"@LinkofHyrule89 @getpeid I would also want to encourage you to read up on the blockchain-technology like @getpeid said. Also take a look into different NFT projects and get a feel for what they are about, what they plan to achieve and follow them closely. Wish you all the best ser!"
36,"@LinkofHyrule89 @getpeid That is why the saying ""DYOR"" was born and always should be used. This goes for anything that you put your assets into. I believe that the blockchain-technology is revolutionary and will be something that is used by everyday people for everyday-things in a couple of years."
37,"@LinkofHyrule89 @getpeid That is the dark-side of this space. However, I would want to state that there certainly are projects that doesn't have that. Projects, that want to do good and actually deliver a valuable product."
38,"@LinkofHyrule89 @getpeid I would say that you are correct in a sense since there are alot of NFT projects that are ""scams"" or ""rug-pulls"" as they are called in the space. I believe this is what you are referring to. These projects are definately affecting this spaces' repuation."
39,"@TheOneNFT yup, and the blockchain-neighborhood is a dangerous place😅"
40,"5/ You could simply order a new Ledger and access your tokens with your unique 24-word recovery phrase.

God bless all of you in this space. You are all super early, and therefore all of us need to be showing each other the way. Please don't let a ~$100 cost you your assets."
41,"4/ Key takeaways: By using i.e. a Ledger, you can keep your tokens safe. Even if you were to use the ledger, you could remain in control of the tokens, as long as you have the seed phrase - which you NEVER should share with anyone."
42,"3/ When you own crypto/nfts, what you really own is a private key that gives you access to your coins/token. You should be the only one in control of this key – and you need to keep it secure. With a hot wallet, you are constantly under threat."
43,"2/ Now if the answer to that question is, ""No, I wouldn't really feel safe doing that"" you should look into getting a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger)."
44,"Security Thread/1 to all of my fellow NFT collectors.
I still meet people in this space that doesn't use cold-wallets for their extremely valuable NFTs. This is absolutely insane. Ask yourself this question: Would I be ok with walking around with $100-400k in my ""backpocket""?"
