22,"5/ Infinity Pools open the gates many Liquidity Providers have been waiting for so long, potentially causing the great TVL migration from other DEXs over to Bancor.📈 https://t.co/XCajLhPjfS"
23,"4/ Now, throw Instant Impermanent Loss Protection into the mix and you’ve got a perfect environment for liquidity providers no other DEX has to offer. 

All those juicy pools like $LINK or $USDC I’ve mentioned earlier will see unstoppable capital inflows."
24,"3/ Infinity Pools remove the requirement for the pools to hold the corresponding amount of $BNT tokens.

In other words, Bancor pools will be limitless allowing huge amounts of capital to be deployed that’s been waiting on the sidelines for a pretty long time now. 📈"
25,"2/ Whoops, there is no more space left for your $USDC

The only way to participate in the pool is to free some space with $BNT, which can be costly. This issue plagues other big pools like $DAI, $USDT or $LINK

It’s a tradeoff that came with Bancor’s v2.1 Impermanent Loss design. https://t.co/VNT8Fsxnjk"
26,"1/ To better understand the magnitude of this feature, let’s take a look at some of the biggest pools like LINK/BNT or USDC/BNT.

Who wouldn’t want that sweet 29% APR on USDC?

Say you want to provide liquidity to that pool, and guess what happens next… https://t.co/90tMsJSuva"
