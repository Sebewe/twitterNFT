0,@monstera_sc Then say you scooped a ton of smfers? Be like I scooped a ton of these mfer derivatives check them out. I’m in agreement on your second point but obfuscation is not the way.
1,@monstera_sc Correction: you scooped a ton of smfers. If you wanna be copy / paste guy it’s cool but don’t flex like you swept the og floor.
2,RT @se_q_uence: The blockchain holds the original mfers.
3,"@pinedegen If you put time, effort, and have something that I like l will buy it. I’m a mfer and I’m gonna act like one. Zero effort money grabs are pretty obvious. The cco is a great experiment in blockchain origination from a creative perspective. As in crypto - there is only one OG (BTC)"

9,@PaulSonne Fear mongering right here. Please add context as opposed to maxims.
10,"@callieabost There is a disconnect here- there will be pockets of risk that are over allocated. However, a better distributed money system assumes less risk - ie risk spread across more market participants."
11,@gggparty I don’t think coalesce is the right way to think about it. traditional nation states will be replaced with sub cultures existing through shared values and ideas. Bitcoin and the relevant technologies remove an obstacle to achieving this goal. Programable structures.
12,@gggparty They don’t have to. History will do the work for them.

68,@APompliano Governments will be competing for individuals in the same way that companies compete for talent. I am convinced that governments can be more efficient utilizing some aspects of blockchains. Sure governments are annoying and we hate authority but blockchains may help.
