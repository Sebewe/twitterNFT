11,@keybeats89 @Blockworks_ @ApeInProd Assuming you were first from your reply? I’d love to know who the first was. I just found it laughable they are using snoop and saying it’s the first

21,@just1n_eth I saw the entire post… there was no attack. People call everything an attack as long as you don’t agree. You were questioning his post which I thought was a legit question and he got defensive. Oh well🤷🏽‍♂️. Guess I’d be bummed not owning an ape anymore either.
22,@just1n_eth 🤣reminds me of the guys at the shop who want to shit talk until they can’t keep up then go tell hr
23,@just1n_eth Is this bc you called him out of his bullshit tops post the other day!?🤣
24,@RamonGovea Whoa shit! There’s always 2 sides to a story
25,@RamonGovea @WaifuWarriors_ Damn dude!! You never sleep.
26,@negithenagi @WaifuWarriors_ @MythDivision Preach!🙌🏽
27,@RamonGovea You’re right I shouldn’t have generalized like that. But those season ones yeah they do deserve it🤣
28,@RamonGovea It’s fuckin crazy and here you are legit grinding providing a true product and people are sleeping on it🤦🏽‍♂️. I guess those people deserve what they got🤷🏽‍♂️
29,@SOLMiningPunks Absolutely! 🙌🏽
30,@nft_lovely @BoredApeYC Welcome to the club!
31,@wiseconnector Yup just stay in your little echo chamber so you think the entire world thinks just like you🙄
32,@NizzyNFT I hear that! Even when things dipped my portfolio is/ was way more money than I’ve ever had in my life! Nfts are wild!
33,@FettyWop_ Yup! Had over a thousand transactions between my wallets and made it super easy. I need to provide info for about 5 which were air drops/ free mints but that’s about it. I was blown away to be honest
34,@Ledger Does this work with metamask mobile?
35,@draxtoshi Brainwashed
36,@ZssBecker @shanicucic96 @neotokyonewstv Alex trying to justify his project being down. What about when you were saying how it was more than bayc? That didn’t last long
37,@Koma_Bopa @Ghxsts Freaking incredible! 🙌🏽
38,@holderofbags Going to do that tonight. Thanks my dude!👊🏽 hope you have been well!
39,@tmagled Same here. I have to constantly take a step back and remind myself how good everything is. Keep your head up! We woke up on this side of the dirt- let’s make it count!👊🏽
40,@KingBlackBored Fuck yeah so well said and laid out. Thank you for speaking up on behalf of us who don’t have the proper words!
41,@Gee__Gazza Whoa!? Do you think it has anything to do with the migration thing?
42,@_miketriumph_ @WaifuWarriors_ Super pumped for @WaifuWarriors_ !!! https://t.co/xxXnhI8aY7
43,@Gfunkera86 Love you @Gfunkera86 and wishing you the best. Stay positive and anything is possible!
44,@BigM33sh Incredible. It basically focused on the kids from Palestine and Israel and their takes on each other and it’s was pretty eye opening. I love you dude
45,@BigM33sh Fucking heart breaking. I remember watching an hbo doc in college and at the end of the movie the Israeli soldiers literally murdered the journalist reporter who had his media vest on and all. That was a rude awakening. The doc was under oboe
46,@boredgentleman They have literally played us against each other like a fucking video game.. it’s sad
47,@17ikoola @beijingdou @SaintBayview @seeapefollowape @PrestigeWW19 @VegabondETH @dadjudicator Shouldn’t*
48,@17ikoola @beijingdou @SaintBayview @seeapefollowape @PrestigeWW19 @VegabondETH @dadjudicator Damnit! Knew I should have sold my only other ape which had the orange beanie with zombie eyes. Those are sick!
49,@BigM33sh Have one for me Meesh… I’m a few months sober but sounds so good today but i will resist!
50,@CRYPTOALBATROSS Lol and most these calls are coming from non apes or ex-apes
51,@WaifuWarriors_ @TheSandboxGame @MythDivision So pumped!!!
52,@WaifuWarriors_ @TheSandboxGame LFG!!!!🚀🚀🚀
53,@DocMundi Always had a weird feeling about binnance
54,@AstonDreamz Sorry to hear that and I have usually seen it from mutant apes or newer users. We are not all the same I promise there are some really solid people in bayc/ mayc.
55,@Stoniphantom Yeah stoni!!! That’s awesome my man!!
56,@reylarsdam Holy shit Rey!! Incredible!
57,@BigM33sh It’s fucking wild. I remember when I leaned this and my whole brain had to get reworked.
58,@KierasDave @RoenschCapital 🤣🤣🤣
59,@RoenschCapital 🤣what a laughing stock our current president is. Dude shouldn’t even be able to drive yet is president🤦🏽‍♂️
60,@nastasyah_art prayer and love for you and your entire family. God speed
61,@ShimmyTurner Nice job taking all of them! Pos scumbags
62,@VGFreakXBL @MalrothN So strange how people are afraid to say that.. I respect people who tell me they don’t know
63,@NizzyNFT I used @CoinTracker which made all the difference
64,@friesframe Congrats!!!🎉🎉
65,@lifestylearb I say it to people on here all the time bc I truly do appreciate their insight or take on certain things.
66,@BigM33sh @SmileFckrs I completely understand and your courage speaks volumes. You are a leader and I’ll gladly follow you!

70,https://t.co/ZhuaEC1QzH
71,@kashviETH Not that it changes much but appreciate your day!
72,I knew the @BoredApeYC mutants had some detail but one was staring me right in the face the whole time. Did anyone notice the collar on the M1 mutants has an ape face on the right side? https://t.co/ocrkN1wwBg
73,@RamonGovea If only they had weapons to fight back
74,I have this merch mutant and would be willing to trade for an m2 mutant if anyone is interested. Hit my dms https://t.co/mYj6w06ROA
75,Been accumulating @DeRaceNFT items. Feel it’s gonna be massive once it releases. @ZedrunN better watch out. https://t.co/tP08HEXHKl
76,@cortez_crypto @DeRaceNFT gonna take over
77,@iamboredbecky @BoredApeYC @decentraland Yup! Up to 3 now but for me the captains hat is the sleeper most forgot about! https://t.co/HeZ5axdik0
78,@NateAlexNFT Same here! Just have 2k to pay off which I should have with my $Strong node by end of the week and boom done! Thanks Web3
79,@tmagled @jenkinsthevalet Do people not realize the scarcity of the key compared to the ticket? So wild seeing keys priced the same as tickets.
80,@NFTWifeLife @RDM_41 My dress up gear nowadays is my bayc hat and shirt. Only time those see the light of day🤣. No more suits considering the hat and shirt cost as much as a suit!
81,@Mysteri66599626 @BoredApeYC I scrub toilets clean diaper wash dishes whatever! I’m not above shit!
82,@RamonGovea Move along nothing to see🙄
83,What a great interview! Makes me excited for the future! https://t.co/hIhXMsicH1
84,@TenaciousEth @yugalabs @BoredApeYC @VStrangeYUGA Thanks for posting. Great interview!
85,@just1n_eth @TheSmarmyBum @fatjoe @doodles Isn’t it the standard celebrity play🤣🤷🏽‍♂️
86,@just1n_eth @TheSmarmyBum @fatjoe @doodles He’s probably dropping an nft this next week
87,@DiscoverXnft I feel naked anytime I swapped my ape. Just didn’t feel right. It’s like when I leave my phone at home… @BoredApeYC make the sickest pfp.. there’s a reason they draw so many eyes. It’s like tasting a beautiful plate of food with your eyes
88,@hex_nft Yup! Works great!
89,@ArtHouseGarbage @coolcatsnft That plus farokh stopped tweeting that he loved the cats
90,@KnukkleDragger Take care of yourself. Luckily you have liquidity with nfts. Stay positive even though I know it is tough at times. Positive vibes and wish you the best!👊🏽
91,@CapetainTrippy I was wondering the same thing!
92,@painter_crypto So cool to see! Thanks for posting!
93,@the_desert_ape @RamonGovea @BoredApeYC It’s like a bow and arrow that the bow has been pulled back and arrow just needs to be released🚀🚀🚀
94,@Knuckl3z__ @CoinTracker 🙌🏽
95,@Knuckl3z__ @CoinTracker I know what you mean. I was expecting to spend a couple of weeks manually doing it but @CoinTracker helped a bunch. Good luck and hope your taxes aren’t too bad👊🏽
96,@Knuckl3z__ Used @CoinTracker and made life way too easy. Yeah I’m gonna pay more than I ever have but I’ve also made more than I ever have an am ready
97,@ZssBecker Facts!🙌🏽
98,@ZssBecker Have to agree I found out the hard way after the fact
99,@JohnJoseph11271 @danielgothits Wow! That second part … your value should never be a reflection…🤯that’s deep!
