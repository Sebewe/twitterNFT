17,@RTFKTstudios LootPod is gunna be the Grand Central of the Metaverse. Taking you wherever you need to go.
18,@ShikamaruNFT @garyvee @LoganPaul @PrimeApePlanet Ya def wouldn’t but sucks that somebody will get tricked. Messed up that you can promote a fake project on @instagram that has full connect wallet and minting functionality.
19,Watch the counter when you refresh that page. This sucks. And it’s actively being advertised on Instagram. https://t.co/HE4Z833KQF
20,Wtf is this BS. I’ve clicked on this insta promo 3 times today. The deadline date keeps changing by a couple hours and the counter of how many have been sold is always around ~6k. And it’s sponsored by @garyvee and @LoganPaul ? This scammy shit needs to get purged. https://t.co/uwHQPVqUFr

27,It seems like NFT prices are more closely tied to USD than ETH. Makes me think I’m a bit too deep because I always am thinking in terms of ETH.
28,@rich_degen Sending ETH is a good idea but receiving a ledger from somebody is a security risk.

43,@0x99ed @opensea @opensea_support This really fucking sucks. Went down a rabbit hole reading about stolen art and it seems it’s illegal to re-sell known stolen art. @opensea should def be on the hook as the dealer and mayb even KJ1 if they knew what they it was stolen before selling to u. Good luck 😕

49,@zz_Locks I hope this theory is right. If not I’m gunna feel like a conspiracy theorist.
50,Do you think @RTFKTstudios knew it would spark the 3D art tsunami by its community like it has? If they pitched me on this vision as a startup there is no way I would have believed them.
51,@Maximonee_ @RTFKTstudios The authorized contract is hard coded to 0x1ae6A4d3078b951438d1aa64DE6C1E4e033913D6 which is rtfkts CTO. It can be toggled though
