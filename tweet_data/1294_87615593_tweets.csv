52,Ps. A hardware wallet is another layer of security. A hacker literally needs to have the hardware connected in order to transfer nfts
53,"I also recommend building another wallet to use as a hot wallet. 

This wallet will be used for mints or other interactions you’ll need in NFTs. 

Only keep minimal funds in there and transfer any valuable NFTs immediately to your cold wallet!"
54,@lisweet33 @RTFKTstudios @clegfx @Zaptio @benitopagotto @oncyber_io @beb_eth Of course! Always looking for those to join the team if the project grows! Best wishes!
55,"NFT SECURITY PSA:
Buy a hardware wallet and dedicate it purely for cold storage. Dont mint or connect this wallet to any webpages unless it they are reputable and trustworthy.

Ohayo Bros use Ledger as our hardware wallet. 

More info on security👇"
