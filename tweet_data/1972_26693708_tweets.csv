0,@TheStalwart @jon_ftx  not perfect but new relationships are developing for BTC and ETH. ETH = cashing tech. BTC = more value like https://t.co/FobmSSDcMD https://t.co/m0KJHuaUZT
1,@NEARWEEK love your work! I'm writing a piece for messari which should help drive some awareness of the protocol. Could you help me understand how you are pulling your developer stats? Want to highlight growth
2,@OwnTheMomentNFT LOVE this. Exactly what i have been looking for

6,@ericgoldenx @EarlyAdopterNFT @NFLALLDAY @EvaluateMarket Yeah think that's def a good call. I just see how people are not realizing how  cheap series one moments are selling for all on day. I expect AD to be 2x-3x more popular than topshot and their series one (even for bad players) is quite high
7,@EarlyAdopterNFT @ericgoldenx @NFLALLDAY @EvaluateMarket Love it. Full rotation from topshot into all day fir me. Takes forever to sell 300+ moments one by one though
8,"@heisenbergrpt H- re your recent interest in crypto I think you would enjoy this looking at correlations for crypto vs traditional asset classes. Also takes a look at diff market regimes

10,Correlation between BTC/ETH remains high but I bet this continues to deteriorate as their different use cases cement themselves. We see shades of that already https://t.co/wqmx7uNbQ8
11,On bear markets--&gt; As expected for price action but notably builders keep building and downturns seem to be getting less severe and less protracted https://t.co/LnQ5mKqUUK
12,"On Inflation--&gt; While BTC and ETH haven’t experienced a high correlation to inflationary pressures in the past, both tokens have popped the minute strong CPI numbers have been released the last few months. They also have tracked inflation expectations very closely https://t.co/HVf4qfjqcY"
13,"On Interest Rate Changes--&gt; No surprises during rising or falling IR environments, they perform as expected but notably BTC/ETH are still inversely correlated to real yields https://t.co/qSGVrHnS4X"
14,"What about BTC? Strangely enough it’s been tracking closer and closer to the large cap value index over time. The top names in the Russell 1000 value index are Berkshire Hathaway, J&amp;J, JP Morgan, United Healthcare, P&amp;G, Bank of America, and Exxon. https://t.co/t2nli7otMx"
15,"As cash flow has increased for ETH the last two years, correlation to the S&amp;P and NASDAQ has increased. As most are aware the top 4 names in both are tech giants $aapl $msft $amzn $goog https://t.co/QA66fpWDKC"
16,"To the riskiest growth stocks BTC averages about a 35% correlation over the last four years while ETH averages about a 30% correlation over the same time period. Notably, Ethereum has been exhibiting a much lower correlation to low/no revenue technology stocks more recently. https://t.co/iB0WyTT8lZ"
17,"BTC and ETH are less risky than you think

32,"8/8 Along with directly sanctioning banks and the bank accounts of the Russian elite the US could financially cripple Russia and either escalate or end this thing fairly quickly. In the meantime Oil likely up, Ruble down, Dollar up, markets/crypto down"
33,"7/8  #crypto may come into play too. Unfortunately. Russia could use it to evade sanctions painting our industry again in the wrong light, BUT it remains to be seen if this could really be done at any scale."
34,6/8 80% of Russian transactions are done over SWIFT. Cutting them off from SWIFT would cripple their commerce for a period. The Europeans would feel some level of pain too as they rely on Russia for oil / nat gas. This could be the mechanism to end this thing quickly.
35,5/8 So can Russia get around a SWIFT sanction? Possibly. Russia has a very small but largely unused back up system (&lt;20% transactions). There are NO alternatives to SWIFT for doing financial transactions internationally in any scale.
36,"4/8 The US has threatened to sanction the platform itself if the US doesn't get its demands, such as when the US wanted to disconnect Iran from SWIFT in 2018 and other SWIFT members disagreed. The US won this battle. Again the US essentially indirectly controls SWIFT"
37,"3/8 SWIFT is an international agency overseen by the FED, BOE, ECB,BOJ and other major banks. The US doesn't control SWIFT but as the world's reserve currency almost all payments are dominated in dollars so the US essentially makes the rules for SWIFT."
38,"2/8 SWIFT helps facilitate messages, which include payments/trades/exchanges, btw banks worldwide. They do ~42 million a day and serve as the backbone of the global payments network."
39,"The US could cripple Russia with one move.

The harshest move the US could make today is banning #Russia from the #SWIFT international payments system
