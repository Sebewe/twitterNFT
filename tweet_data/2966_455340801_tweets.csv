55,"@KurtMage @rayeo_tnj @DGBismyfriend @Snowden I’ll use a new word moving forward.  Concept remains same.  Chase Bank. Google. Facebook. All analytical tools now for retargeting and data.  These customer visits to Coinbase were a massive win, and not about immediate conversion."
56,"@KurtMage @rayeo_tnj @DGBismyfriend @Snowden There are so many pixels usually hidden behind a screen now.  I’m using a “laymen’s term” to keep it simple for you.  

My point is, this is a young man’s game now and you should continue to research more."
57,"@KurtMage @rayeo_tnj @DGBismyfriend @Snowden No. Facebook and Google pixels allow us to drop cookie that will track visitors on the website so we can reach out to them later, also known as retargeting."
58,"@rayeo_tnj @DGBismyfriend @Snowden False. You visited, and thus gave them your metadata. They have pixels set up on the website to collect this and will retarget you with ads later.  Welcome to new customer acquisition."
