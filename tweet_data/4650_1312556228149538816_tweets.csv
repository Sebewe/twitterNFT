6,@loserclubreborn Hello @loserclubreborn - I sent @CaveGuy420 my wallet address as he asked for WL but I can’t get in the discord. Can you please help? Thanks!

8,@ReeseW @nftnow Hi @ReeseW ! Please check out @NotYourBroNFT - women led and giving back to women and LGBTQIA communities! A couple genuine ladies trying to affect change. Pew-sale mint going on now.
9,"@niknakalliewak @NotYourBroNFT Ya - you have to open up MetaMask and put the link to the mint page under browser. Also, please don’t interact or respond with the spam engagement farming replies. Happens when you tweet the word MM."
10,"@KingBlackBored @danielgothits ""3/4 singles would be more interested in you if you paid the bill in Bitcoin.""

""33% of singles are more likely to go on a date if one mentions crypto in their online dating profile."""
11,"@KingBlackBored @danielgothits ""Nearly 20% of singles would be more interested in you if you have an NFT PFP."" Maybe more for the ape fuckers?"
12,@KingBlackBored @danielgothits I saw this one right before Valentine's Day. CNBC even: https://t.co/Y2bONpv6G1

25,@eligh @melba_marat I was just talking about how I am a hip-hop girl for life and I see you in the NFT realm. Happy to see those whose music I listened to (and still do) doing well and venturing into the NFT space. Congrats on the NFT drops and keep up the good work!

38,@JeffbitZA @ndo3_0 @TheShamdoo @MonkeDAO It also depends on the location.
39,"@JeffbitZA @ndo3_0 @TheShamdoo @MonkeDAO I’ll disagree that an LLC is required. Other DAOs have become entities differently. For example, Maker DAO has multiple layers of protection, including outside the US., according to the last time I read their documents."
40,"@ndo3_0 @TheShamdoo Most projects that create a DAO do not do so as a recognized legal entity and therefore may fall under the rules of the SEC, which, among other things, may require registering with the SEC."
41,@spriteclubNFT Medium article says to reach out if one wants to get involved. I’m reaching out and would love to be a part of the community with a discord invite. Cheers.
42,@loserclubreborn @badcardsclub If it weren’t for the loser club I would be alone  in my solitude and boredom. But loser club slows me to be part of a community of other losers like me.
43,@Lobes604 Hello! I’ve requested to speak in spaces and would love to talk about my first rugged project that went on to rug more projects. I have tried to call them multiple times and they blocked me on Twitter and I’m discords.
44,@imdannydope @loserclubreborn I think they may mean the ones we hide because we may be ashamed?? Lol.

49,@williamthemself @Panchorizos @chikn_nft Check out @NiftyKitApp for no code smart contract ownership and drop tools. If you have a front end dev for website they can use niftykit’s API and you can have the mint button on your website.
50,@0xSketchers Check out @NiftyKitApp (backend dev) for a no code smart contract and drop tools. Website is a front end dev though.
51,@babushka99 @NiftyKitApp has great tools in addition to no code smart contract ownership
52,"@judeaz_ Check out @NotYourBroNFT - Nonprofit donating, artist fund, and more. :)"
53,@babie_wtf Love you! You got this. Proud of you.
54,@aitzal18 @0xBiZzy The medium article is great. And I believe derivatives are their own projects. I appreciate giving the respect to the inspiration.
55,@Vegasjason @LasVegasNFT Did not exist? A rug?
56,@theartplugsays Check out @NotYourBroNFT for a great female leg project giving back to women. And @EtherealApes for great team and great art!!
57,"@theartplugsays @MeyhemLauren @finclubnft You mention NFTs today are all about utility. What about under promising and over delivering? I don’t particularly trust most projects that make a roadmap of promises that “check all the boxes.”  Merch, metaverse, game, etc. I look at teams regardless of roadmap."

81,@BackwoodMessiah @Dad_And_KidsNFT @the_x2y2 Have to earn the community’s trust. Don’t think that was done today.
82,@CyberBourbaki @vladtoni That’s why a corporation that La purpose is to empower creators to own their own smart contracts and manage their drops is important. That would go out if biz if the screwed anyone. Check out @NiftyKitApp
83,@bonnett_alex Hey! Check out @NiftyKitApp. No code smart contract ownership and drop tools with dropkit (beta). Looks like dropkit would be perfect for you. @Hashlipsnft  can help generate and layer the art and then create json files. Discord is a great place to ask questions. Cheers.
84,@CryptoJooj Hey! Check out @NiftyKitApp for the backend dev. No code smart contract ownership and drop tools with dropkit (beta). Trust a business that lives smart contracts. Discord is a great place to ask questions. Cheers.

86,@Dad_And_KidsNFT @the_x2y2 Me too - they decided to change  the the original agreement we agreed to and now want collections with &gt;1 eth in sales in the last 24 hours. Misrepresentation.
87,@the_x2y2 I was almost done with the original requirements when you closed the airdrop. Now you want me to pay even more when I already met the requirements both you and I agreed upon on. your website.
88,@the_x2y2 You need to earn the trust of the community for this. You did the opposite today.
89,@StanceFi @the_x2y2 I am one of these people. I was almost done with the requirements before the site was originakly shut down.
