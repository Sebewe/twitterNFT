in an increasingly remote world, being able to meet with and jam with your team is a huge competitive advantage

everything just flows better once you’ve shared real world experiences

so bullish on this team 🚀 https://t.co/rylRXImXzb"
1,Kevin’s having almost a 3 ETH floor is the most degenerative thing i’ve seen so far 😂 https://t.co/4xF0oJfyva
2,"Pre mint, the value of an NFT is 90% art, 10% utility 

Post mint it’s 90% utility, 10% art 

There’s still a huge feeling of ‘now what’ whenever a project reveals- projects which add consistent value to the token are the only ones which will hold their price"
3,"We’re in a dangerous time with FOMO at an all time high 

People are playing with money they can’t afford to lose in the hope of the next big win

Rug pulls drain the space of liquidity and tarnish the whole industry

It sucks and the tech is the best way to solve this"
4,"Creators should have to commit to the artwork they’re selling and provide a significant sample of the artwork before it’s minted 

At @thirdweb_ we’ve implemented tech which requires creators to ‘lock in’ artwork at mint - a strong first step https://t.co/i0hQKFujHR"
5,"We use language like “DYOR” and “Rugged” to make light of these situations but this places responsibility on buyers as opposed to creators

Instead we should be doing more to make shit like this impossible to pull off - otherwise we’re going nowhere"
6,"Pixelmon is funny but reversed  progress in the NFT space

It’s difficult to argue against the ‘NFTs are a scam’ argument when there are so many public scams disguised as NFT drops

False advertising is illegal and creators should be held accountable 

Not everyone has 8k to lose https://t.co/19f4XTmpSb"

10,"Nike quietly launched a collection outside of RTFKT this week

A small PFP collection by designer Tinker Hatfield which can be redeemed for a physical shoe - now at 7 eth floor.

Small, considered collections with no hype is how you prove the viability of NFTs as a revenue stream https://t.co/Q3fDmcwMPG"

15,"@imbadatlife I mean linkedin is pretty standard 

we’re trying to find candidates who really want it so it should be hard, and if sending an email is too hard then it’s probably not for you anyway"
16,"@imbadatlife hmm maybe, I think if you really wanted the position you’d do both - it’s an extra 2 minutes"
17,"spotify has conditioned us to believe that there shouldn’t be a middle class in music 

you’re either beyonce or broke 

if starting that conversation means paying $200 for a kanye album then so be it https://t.co/8IrCFKWd0N"
18,"@imbadatlife how could somebody make that mistake? like I accidentally typed the sentence?

with internships people mass apply without reading JD’s - which is fine because it’s a numbers game but it’s good to find people who really want the job"
19,"I put out postings for internships on a few recruiting sites recently

At the bottom of every listing I put “I will only be reviewing applicants who email their resume to…” 

Had over 200 applications, and 5 emails. 

It’s so easy to stand out sometimes"

21,"we're in the wild west of crypto advertising era

seeing 'you're still early' subway ads and 'we're going to the moon' superbowl spots made me very uncomfortable

before there's regulation it's a responsibility of the space not to prey on FOMO"
22,"RT @thirdweb_: Has anyone seen web3? 

Since thirdweb launched in December, over 60,000 custom smart contracts have been deployed.

All on…"
23,"it’s amazing to me that instagram watched the NFT avatar space explode with people expressing themselves as apes, aliens, mutants, anime characters and everything inbetween 

and then launched the most sterile avatar builder you can imagine https://t.co/dg3d32p3dA"
24,"on that note - if you're an agency who can execute or market NFT drops please drop me a DM

have some of the biggest brands in the world to throw your way 👀 https://t.co/E36G3UE57k"

26,"if your agency hasn't built a team dedicated to learning how to market or execute web3/NFT projects then you're missing out on millions in revenue

the demand is insane right now"
27,"in 2020 there were 300k connected wallets trading NFTs

100 Thieves just gave away over 300k NFTs with one drop - a huge portion claiming their first NFT

One well executed drop can literally move the needle for the whole industry

incredible execution and an important moment for the web3 gaming space 👏 https://t.co/GslmnHEy2f"
33,"I don't think we fully appreciated how groundbreaking the mutant drop from @BoredApeYC was

Expanded the collection by 20k whilst rewarding original holders w/ a 20eth airdrop

The serum mechanic means mutants will still be revealed years after the drop - they're always relevant"
34,excited to explore @thecosmos @9th https://t.co/erdkPQHKon
35,"to be clear - I have no idea whether Moonpay covers the costs of the NFTs for celebrities they buy Apes for, just speculating that it would be a smart move if they did"
36,"Leveraging the power of communities is the new influencer marketing

Brands or personalities buying NFTs rallies the community in support and earns free distribution

I spoke to @inputmag abt how Moonpay are doing this with celebrities &amp; Bored Apes👇

41,"the best strategists i’ve ever worked with are intensely curious and open to new ideas

they understand the nuance behind new technology and put in the research before deciding their opinion

if web3 has done one thing, it’s exposed all of the bad strategists"

44,"@michaelheavenjr no doubt it's a masterstroke - I just don't like the outcome

it's artificial culture and the song is terrible 🤷‍♂️"
45,"having reflected on this i’ve decided that I hate it

when tiktok started getting popular I was excited by what it meant for independent artists - better discovery, more money and more music

we’ve gone the other way - there’s more industry plants than ever b/c of tiktok https://t.co/63yLHn5Otv"
46,"I don’t like this side of web3

brands using NFT projects as a marketing vehicle to generate artificial buzz and capture attention

we dont mind because it’s pumping our bags - but it feels disingenuous and trivialises the tech https://t.co/PLInG3Yqfs"

it depends how you interpreted fail"

turning down high paying, fancy sounding titles in favour of risky opportunities with immense upside is a career choice i’m yet to see fail"

I believed it did until apes flipped punks and it was clear utility mattered most"
54,"little hexagons all over your timeline constantly reminding you of the influence of the space

twitter have created a war on the timeline and it’s hilarious"
55,"when technology comes along which people aren’t interested in, most people just ignore it and live their lives

with web3, people actively *hate* it 

I think it’s because it’s unavoidable, which must be annoying 

the twitter pfp verification is the best example of this so far"

never been a wealth building opportunity with a lower barrier to entry"
63,"people love to say crypto/web3 is just ‘the rich getting richer’

the people who get rich are those curious enough to put in the countless hours of research required to spot opportunity 

it’s true that a pool of those people were also already rich - but it isn’t a requirement"

66,"@DougAtLast I got the impression IreneDAO blew up as a meme more than anything 

Similar to @Ghozali_Ghozalu - memes sit outside of any marketing playbook and just happen for no reason ha"
67,"focus is going to be a superpower in this space

an NFT is as broad a concept as a web page - you don’t need to know the intricacies of every available model

choose a lane, go deep and learn the nuance https://t.co/EnOpDBnXwI"
68,"there’s also a heightened understanding of marketing in this space

the technical barrier to entry means a more technical audience on average

very difficult to mask a bad product with good marketing in this space"
69,"many web2 marketing tactics can actually have the reverse desired effect with NFT/Web3 projects 

paid ads and influencers for example are a red flag when weighing up a project 

a community built organically is much more valuable and likely to last than one built through paid"

Partnering with NFT projects to use their IP in creative endeavours is going to be a huge trend in the traditional media space

75,"artistic movements are determined by the tastes of those wealthy enough to buy and collect art

the newly crypto-rich like their art to be made by computers (PFP projects, generative art) and to be about memes

algorithms are the new paintbrushes and memes are the new lilypads"
76,"@mrblairbowman huge opportunity, why dismiss it?"
77,"the $LOOKS airdrop is a fascinating growth hack

rewarding people based on their usage of the platform they're trying to displace

crypto native platforms can now steal their competitors audience's attention using rewards based on publicly available information 

wild times"

I just don't see how making the world a more open and accessible place through technology can be viewed as a bad thing because it gives privileged people headaches"
86,"@joehudsonsmall yes they can - and you'd agree that's a good thing right?

so why not make that experience more immersive - where they feel closer to people they work with, can add more value and gain more from the experience 

you lose a lot of nuance on zoom"
87,"I do believe this is a good thing though

people are way more transparent about money than ever before and this has helped people understand the financial system better than they ever could

may as well tap into a community which over-indexes on Twitter and boost engagement 

it’ll likely also die down when (if) the pfp changes back"

when an artist tries to single handedly run a project it tends to overwhelm. 

they have an experienced builder in @evankeast heading the project, leaving the artist to focus on art direction.

95,"doodles might just be the next blue chip

96,"@mitkopitko7 yeah I agree - I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing at all

i’ve definitely learnt a tonne more about finance/investing due to the transparency in the space"
