59,What a crazy night last night! I know I’m involved in some awesome NFT communities when they are talking about how to stay safe with the “hack”. We didn’t know for sure what was going on except NFTs we’re going away. Thank you to all of them. Seems to have been a phishing scam.
60,@ryan2d970 @ColinLieb @opensea I knew I was doing something right!
61,"@NudeYogaGirl Wait a second! You don’t give any $hits what random people on Twitter think? Great for you! Although, you probably don’t care about that either. Have an amazing day!"
