24,"Tech has changed the world, but crypto is broader.  It not only spans hardware and software, but culture, governance, identity, art, security, monetary policy, gaming, and much more.  Will be fascinating the watch the continued splintering and specialization that unfolds."
25,"As you go deeper into crypto you realize the breadth of the space.  Saying ""I'm into crypto"" is akin to saying ""I'm into tech"" in 1999.  20 years later, ""tech funds"" or ""tech companies"" -- there are dozens or hundreds of multi-billion $ sub-sectors within tech."
