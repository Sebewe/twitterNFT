63,@missevaphoto @jaimedelpizz0 It’s waaaay more common than it should be…especially in SoCal. When you are so distracted that you drive away from the pump with the hose still in your gas tank…you might need to unplug and meditate. Often.
64,"@cathsimard_ My perspective is that of an artist and someone who has not been able to purchase/invest in a pfp project. 
I think people buy photography NFT for the sake of the art and the artist. People buy a pfp because it might be a winning lottery ticket. Am I wrong?"
