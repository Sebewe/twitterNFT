A huge thank you to the 2783 unique @ballmanproject holders (out of 5555 tokens), the community, especially our OGs/VIPs, our collab partners, the MOD team, the project team and last but not least, our leader @stanwawrinka 

The hard(er) work starts now🚀

Lets Go!🎾🎾 https://t.co/lfXwsnnOw2"
59,"12/13...

We sold out 5555 tokens at an average of over 0.1 ETH in under three months of failing to sell more than 200 NFTs in V1

HOW? 

Well it's been a long winded way of saying;

WE VALUED, LISTENED AND TOOK ACTION BASED ON THE COMMUNITY!

Very simple to say, very hard to do! https://t.co/R0oMHBXMc9"
60,"11/13...

We rewarded the V1 loyal NFT holders with VIP status👑

We compensated them with extra tokens to align the original high mint price with the new lower V2 price🎾🎾🎾

They had direct line of comms to the team and continued to influence decision making!

We grew, a lot👀 https://t.co/8NCcGmYiOS"
61,"10/13...

The biggest community informed change was the price. We created a tiered system from 0.08 up to 0.125 ETH. Again, listening to the community and a big change from the 0.5/0.3 ETH price in V1

This allowed for the @ballmanproject to be within reach of more Tennis fans👍 https://t.co/70By2TAgkV"
62,"9/13...

...we rebuilt the community reaching 3k Discord by end of Jan and over 10k by mint on 16th Feb💪

We stuck to our roadmap and remained open and transparent with the community✅

The team engaged in the discord and continued to take on feedback, actioning where possible✅ https://t.co/GaiibehnVL"
63,"8/13...

The Whitepaper quickly followed and we had our project. We'd taken ~6 weeks to do things right, trusting our loyal community would help us when we launched V2🤝

And helps us they did🚀

Organically, and with targetted collabs with projects that shared similar values... https://t.co/duXr2S121j"
64,"7/13...

The roadmap contained some big project changes, including the launch of a Metaverse Tennis Tour game.

Ripping up V1 and going with V2 was brave.

Many of the V2 ideas were put forward by the community. Again, the project LISTENED and valued those who had stuck loyal🤝 https://t.co/z1C00n8XON"
65,"6/13...

We commited to organic growth✅

We committed to being transparent and honest with the community, ALWAYS ✅

Armed with a new foundation/strategy, renewed community confidence (still at 1k discord) and engagement, a roadmap was born. https://t.co/edfImEvJPE"
66,"5/13...

... wasn't enough to sell a NFT project!!💡

We onboarded a new Mod team made entirely from Community members✅

We asked the community to feedback ideas, and actually listened✅

We communicated a longer timeline and went to work re-imagining the project✅ https://t.co/NtQvAZYOap"
67,"4/13...

The most important aspect of the rebuild was the reflective piece of work which took around 2 weeks!
