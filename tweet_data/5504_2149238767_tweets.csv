Let's support Ukrainian artists and Russian activists. Let's spread their word &amp; art.
Let's stay united.

🙏🕊️✨🇺🇦"

How much I wish that the positive wave that is being raised in Web3 would rival and surpass the physical reality.🕊️

13,Keep this in mind: the beauty of Web3 is to be open to learning and willing to change the world. 💗
14,A space filled with inspiring stories and lives that were changed forever. A space that is made of communities for common support and so so many incredible people who are ready to lift and guide you.
15,"I’ve worked diligently to understand the web3 world, a space where an artist’s potential can flourish both individually and collectively outside the confines of the industry. A space that is made of positivity and encouraging people."
16,"Oh yes, I have made my own mistakes and I am sure many learnings are still ahead. But one thing I know for sure is that DYOR &amp; Emotional Intelligence represent some of the biggest assets you can have when entering the NFTs world."
17,"As @jillrgunter tweeted last week: ""you won’t learn crypto/Web3 from a curriculum. You will learn it by installing Metamask, buying some ETH, moving some to a Ledger, paying gas fees, minting an NFT, joining a discord community, asking things on Twitter, etc."""
