16,"@nateschmold it’s not about solving piracy, more about introducing a new model of monetising sample packs that has different incentives behind buying them &amp; makes piracy pointless"
17,"@IAMYOUOFFICIAL by samples I exclusively mean instrumental compositions, loops. so kinda like Looperman or Wavsupply loop kits but NFTs. if/when a sample gets placed on a song that makes $ on Spotify, half of every check the producer receives, gets manually sent to the NFT holder in stablecoins"
18,@nik_carpentieri Right? It’s a flex to all other music nerds. Imagine owning and hearing a sample before Drake used it in a radio hit
19,@nik_carpentieri how long until that’s the norm? 🤔
20,"@filu84 I’m not talking about samples as in kicks, snares or hi hats. I mean samples as instrumental loops"
21,"Each sample NFT would basically represent a ticket to the producer’s personal “sample lottery” - the process of sending out samples to their network of drummers who might get the sample placed on a big record and get everyone, including the NFT holder, paid."
22,"@MdCL true. until streaming is paid out on chain, we'd need a trust system set up between producers &amp; collectors that payments will be sent. but similar to other NFTs, it'd ultimately be collectors' responsibility to make sure they're buying from reputable producers &amp; not scammers."
23,@hedsDAO @arpeggi_labs big fan of arpeggi
24,Would you use it? 🤔
25,"So. what if there was a platform where producers can easily upload &amp; sell 1/1 sample NFTs to:

1. Fans who love to collect&amp;support their art

2. Speculators who want to A&amp;R and invest at the same

3. Drummers who use the samples and want to own the NFT in case they place the beat"
26,"But sample NFTs would allow producers to monetize their work before the traditional music industry even gets to touch it.

All profits of primary sales and royalties on secondary market go to the producer’s wallet without any expensive legal help or questionable deals."
27,"Why is this important?

Every working music producer in the world knows the struggles of getting paid in traditional music industry.

https://t.co/yYt3H7obT0"
28,"Anyone can still 'pirate' the wav files but only 1 person gets to undeniably own the NFT associated with all its owner’s benefits.

https://t.co/hw4GWQJo3T"
29,"Samples that don't get placed stay digital collectibles fans can own and trade.

But if a sample gets placed with a major label, the producer takes every dollar the song earns him, turns 50% into USDC and sends it to whatever wallet owns the NFT at that moment."
30,A vibrant market like that would allow producers to monetise every sample they create while their fans collect samples they love with the potential upside of splitting a lifetime check with the producer they supported.
31,But the speculative nature of samples &amp; placements allows us to create a more interesting market by associating each NFT with 50% copyright ownership of the sample.
32,"Instead of wav files &amp; leasing rights, producers could sell samples as digital art collectibles.

Similar to how people collect song NFTs on @catalogworks or @soundxyz_, music enthusiasts could collect samples made by their favorite producers.

https://t.co/g4fBpaPhFN"
33,"The most popular way of monetizing overflow of samples is selling sample packs to drum producers on web2 platforms like Wavsupply.

Buyers acquire the rights to use the samples in beats and sell them as leases or exclusives to rappers online.

https://t.co/bbLLQfsvbi"
34,"Many producers focus their careers on creating &amp; sending out samples to drum producers hoping to catch a placement through their network.

Since it’s impossible to place everything, producers have 100s of samples collecting dust on hard drives or Dropbox.

https://t.co/Rwczs5UBFW"
35,"Samples (sometimes called loops) are musical compositions made by producers for producers.

It’s the most common form of collaboration, where one producer makes the melodies and the other one adds drums to create a full beat.

Example of a sample:

36,I've been thinking a lot about how music producers could tokenize their samples and here's my take on it (repost).
