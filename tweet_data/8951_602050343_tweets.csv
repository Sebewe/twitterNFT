6,@Feeetje2 You can but like I said by the time I posted it was hours old and not guaranteed.
7,@Feeetje2 I re-checked yesterday. When I checked yesterday what was still left I didn’t take new pictures. Everything I posted was still available last night when I checked.

58,@AGreatDomain I don’t think you can if it’s not on the drop down. You can always email service at Afternic  dot com for clarification
59,@AGreatDomain Bottom line though is what you can see in the drop down for search is what you can list. https://t.co/0EJxZPmomU
60,@AGreatDomain If it’s in the results of search that is different than a filter. Afternic has a relationship with some registries to sell their inventory. Not sure about these tlds specifically. There are other ways to get listed like an event or grandfathered terms etc.
61,@AGreatDomain I don’t see those tlds on the search drop down. If they aren’t there you can’t list them as a customer. Afternic isn’t my product so maybe im missing it but where are you seeing it in search?
