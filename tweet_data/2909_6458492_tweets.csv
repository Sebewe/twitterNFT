17,"To my beloved son Ralphael, who loves art, who is a 2nd-generation NFT artist, whose work I have held to the loving standard I held and hold you, Happy Birthday and congratulations!🎂
I love and admire you. I am honored to be holding your torch up for our world to know.🔥⚡️🌞🤟"
18,"This is the debut NFT art of 11-year old Ralphael Weitzman Mongo.
The Original is Ralphael's signature piece, representative of the visionary work he has been producing for a tenth of his life.
Like the artist, it is full of love, wonder, mystery, and joy. https://t.co/1O1SJDukDT https://t.co/fr09arvdlx"
19,Now without further ado…
20,"The art reveal is next. Before it, I get to thank Ralphael's teachers and mentors Michel Delgado and Ali @Sabet. Ralphael is the young man he is because of my influence. He is the artist he is because of theirs. You are magic and he is blessed. https://t.co/p0dHq9UMwX"
21,That's quite a build up.
22,"As a boy having men in our lives who are credible, inspiring, and trustworthy is crucial. For myself, I got to learn it is never too late for this to happen. For Ralphael, he has received loving models of how he may be by virtue of myself and others."
23,The Original is titled in recognition to who he is and what he is and who has made a difference on him and who he is becoming.
24,"Which brings me to the piece, his first minted NFT artwork. The piece is titled The Original."
25,He and I talk about magic daily. Magic is a word to describe what is real and cannot be described by a word. It is tao.
26,"How our relations seems to me is if I am a number, he will always be a number greater. If I am a seven, Ralphael gets to be an eight. By virtue of the importance of his place in my life, Ralphael has bathed, basked, steeped, and swam with me in the currents of that life."
27,"Unlike me, Ralphael has a dad who has his son around him as a matter of course. Ralphael is me, and I get to be him, too. It is wonder unlimited."
28,I have been unrelenting and fair in my encouragement of Ralphael–as a human being and as an artist–and that fair encouragement extends to his work.
29,"Like me his dad, Ralphael is an artist. Ralphael's work is sophisticated. It is filled with passion, inspiration, mystery, and joy."
30,"Gm gm, world. My son Ralphael yesterday turned 11.

73,@fiaanaut @celestelabedz @DrSianProctor @gwareham_organ Web 2.0 gave us no opportunities. We were given the “privilege” [sic] of building corporations.

75,"@fiaanaut @celestelabedz @DrSianProctor @gwareham_organ Marcia, for who, though? White Americans? Over what period of time? Because the transfer of wealth happening in Web 3.0 is cross cultural, international, multi-generational, and happening now. https://t.co/FwmIlBguxF"

And it is getting more efficient, moving from proof of work to proof of stake. @DrSianProctor and my collaboration @MongoMugs were built on @0xPolygon which is less carbon impacting than a phone charge. Here’s the breakdown, problems and solutions. https://t.co/NCfolnbz5L"
77,"@fiaanaut @celestelabedz @DrSianProctor @gwareham_organ Marcia, re economics, this is incorrect. NFTs and Web 3.0 are responsible for the largest wealth shift in human history. And everyday more folks who haven’t had means are discovering new means because of art and NFTs."
