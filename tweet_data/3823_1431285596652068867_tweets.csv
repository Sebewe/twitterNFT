13,@CryptoCocktail_ Yea the main reason I got it was to test out the different metaverse's. I wear glasses and it is incredibly uncomfortable with the glasses I have which is disappointing but hopefully I can get used to it...
14,"@CryptoCocktail_ So far I feel very much out of my element. The ping pong game is a lot of fun, but on Population: One I was starting to feel sick. I heard that gets better the more you get used to it though. I am excited to try some metaverse gaming on this."
15,"@zxckblxck Let me know if you pick one up. So far I have Population: One, Eleven and Beat Saber, although I am terrible at each one."

It is not really OS fault (subjective to implementing plain text sigs). What we need more is better education to make sure people don’t sign for things they have no idea about.
