1,@TDisco7 @PUMA Totally understand that perspective! Definitely cool to be in talks with a big brand name. I just have a different view on what type of marketing I vibe with :p
2,"NGL, I feel when a company like @PUMA unveils so many partnerships at the same time and rapidly showcases them with no depth, it devalues each of those relationships in the public eye. LL collab seems a lot less special when all they had to do was be a cat to earn it apparently."
3,@Helloimmorgan Literally did a spit take with my Dr Pepper when I saw this. Totally worth the mess.
