It is inspiring how much more impact we the people have today, compared to ever before

#cryptocurrency #Bitcoin"
5,"It's a turning point in history.. This is possible in part thanks to cryptocurrency. 

Have you tried donating to Ukraine through your normal bank? It would take a few days, if not week+

$20 million USD was donated to Ukraine in crypto the past few days. 🙏 borderless currency"

This is incredible.. that through action and support of a global community we are able to buy out soldiers fighting in a dictator war

Goal is to raise $500k now versus $1M 🙏 Can always release another set if we fully mint this one.

52,"@RealSupDucks Forgot to add a note about $VOLT, the SupDucks token. Thanks @Drizzle5036 for calling it out.

Every Duck earns 10 VOLT daily. Passive income for holding a Duck.

It's used inside the SupDuck world to buy more NFTs and enhance the exp. It's also given out to members who help out"
53,@redsoftdrink @doodles @RealSupDucks It def has its own style and subject to opinions. The quality of the art is high though.
54,@Drizzle5036 @doodles @RealSupDucks @frankynines Great call out! Didn't cover VOLT token. That's definitely another value add.

59,"All in all, I'm bullish on @RealSupDucks and see them becoming another blue chip of the future. I plan to accumulate even more 🚀😎"
60,"Finally, the art is pretty dank. Created by @frankynines back in 2016, it's a style he has developed over many years. 

From trippy to quirky, these ducks quack and are ready to party 🤪"
61,"They're also innovating with new ideas and tech for NFTs. Borderline #onchain gaming, the SupDucks experience is refreshing and I'm excited to see how they build it out further.

You'll soon be able to lick another NFT (megatoadz) to change and evolve your SupDucks 👀"
62,"Which leads me to the next point - the team is investing into the project. They didn't make revenue in initial mint and bounce. 

They're treating it like a real business, with a physical studio, legal incorporation, paid employees, and more... This ain't no squiggles."
63,"The quality behind everything they produce is top notch. Just take a look at the YouTube series they run for community updates 🎥

I used to run backstage Zoom during 2020 and it takes a dedicated team to get the quality SupDucks is putting out."
64,"First off, the team are Web3 veterans. The creator of SupDucks, @frankynines, worked for @dapperlabs before launching the ducks. 

Dapper Labs is the studio behind @CryptoKitties, one of the OG and first major NFT collections."

67,"@AdamSinger @joemacktrustee true... everyone's gauge of worth it depends on how much they value what comes after... whether that be investment opportunities, having access to a border-less currency, or just the belief in a transparent monetary system"
68,@AdamSinger @joemacktrustee Don't think this is comparable. Setting up a web host takes research and some learning. Downloading an app and buying some crypto takes a few minutes and is pretty straightforward. It's the part after that gets cumbersome.
69,@AdamSinger It's true.. Simpler onboarding is something the space needs. It's a balance between taking away user control of their wallets for easier use or giving the user total ownership but more complicated to use
