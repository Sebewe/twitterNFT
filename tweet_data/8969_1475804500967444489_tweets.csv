9,"A lot of the team was invested in bored apes and the things we afford we can afford because of BAYC, not because of trippies. We're not hiding anything.

I'm helping out my friend @JoeRuizArt with @TOTACollection, that doesn't mean I can't focus on trippies."
10,"We're still here and we wont go anywhere. This is not a rug. Jon and Robin quit is job to work on this. We are putting the time and money back into the project. The mint money is being put to good use.

Judge us on the timeframe, we're putting the work in every week and it shows."

17,"I bought many tokens, sheeps and wolves when the price dipped because everyone panicked. When the game returned i profited big, making $1k a day.

✅ This is where I learned we need to do things to reward our @trippies community for sticking through bad times and good times."

Topic switches to OpenSea and it's issues. Skipping this part, no alpha for trippies.

❓[1:27:40] Questions from Discord: What are some ideas you've thrown at the team from your exp with @wolfdotgame ?"
20,"@ShaneCultra talking about how this space is super new. Anybody with a ""lot"" of experience was in it only for a year. To say we don't make mistakes would be a lie. But we try very hard to make it good and repair our mistakes. We're business men and we learn from mistakes."
21,"@VitoDotTV outs himself as an Android User. Sorry bud :P

@ShaneCultra is taking over.
""Cosmics are Trippies too"""
24,"❓[1:03:14] One last question for @ShamanTrippies, it's the middle of the night in his timezone: Is there any plan to have revenue share for the Cosmic Trippies too (maybe less than the OG Trippies)?

25,"Okay I'm back, more Alpha coming in:

✅ The slots are intended to be a community rev share...."
48,"✅ The team is looking to keep us interested without revealing too much too soon.

❓[36:37] Is the revenue share rumors real?

✅ That is true. When the team partnered with @Bitcasinoio the negotiated a ~20% revenue share of slots (Jon is not involved in the finance side much)"
49,"✅ The Team is looking more into a storyline reveal. Talking about the background of the island, the PTs and why the Cosmics are there – what are they up to?
