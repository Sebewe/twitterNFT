46,Honestly I can't wait for @psychedelic_nft C1 to EXPLODE. I want to be able to collect some profit from my extras and put that into other promising projects. I have a few in mind.
47,@vohlii @wabdoteth @BAYC2745 @HyphyAUS I see a SpacePals in my future.... 👀
48,@wabdoteth @BAYC2745 @HyphyAUS @vohlii Yessir definitely! Also I forgot AngryApeArmy. Love them as well.

58,@wabdoteth 1 UNHATCHED = 1 GOD
59,@kloss_eth @KamilNosal6 @psychedelic_nft Yeah most collections are in a supply shock. It looks pretty crazy seeing some 10k collections only have like 200 listed haha
60,@kloss_eth @KamilNosal6 @psychedelic_nft That already happened so whatever it's at now is accurate. We'll see which goes mooning first.
61,Everything with the @psychedelic_nft collection is THIN THIN THIN holy smokes.

68,@wabdoteth That's exciting for the 8k or so who haven't hatched yet. How many Deity's in total? 4?
69,"@wabdoteth So if I'm looking at the collection info correctly, only 1 Deity has been hatched out of all hatched eggs?"
70,@KEEMSTAR Yeah I'm guessing Russia is also watching these trying to get intel on locations. My guess.
71,@DuxNutz @WalkersCrypto @fragcolor Tell me how big please. I need underlying details.
72,@wabdoteth thanks for the follow father. 🙏💪
73,@MitcheIl @0xDavisBlake https://t.co/zWpeMTf25P
74,@wabdoteth Why you keep getting me to hatch fam? It ain't happening. You can buy my 2 unhatched eggs for 5 eth/e in 2 months.
75,@thy_crypto @picoyoda Yeah yeah that's it. Perfect thanks for the response fam.
76,Yo eth you alright? You kind of doing a little thing right now?
77,@picoyoda Aight so I'm kind of out of the loop here but....is it possible to get DE through just holding the Genesis? Or are you going to have to burn the comps/passes to get it? I can't remember. Honestly hoping for the later so I can sell the comps for nice profit haha
