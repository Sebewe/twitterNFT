coincidence or fate that my @brkfstworldnft OG package arrived while I was making myself a brkfst sandy?

23,"was really stoked to open my @nbatopshot all-star elite pack until I saw what $50 got me. not mad about my wagner serial #, but for the pack's price tag, I would expect a little more value in return. would have been a nice touch to include a guaranteed s2 moment at the least https://t.co/aYL0P6UzPo"

31,"@betty_nft Mekaverse was far from a perfect project, however I think they nailed the raffle system to ensure fairness for everyone. a new avenue may be to allocate a portion &lt;50% to WL and raffle the rest. we need to stop exploiting “community members” for their talent and devotion."

36,@Zeneca_33 his storytelling ability is really amplified by him narrating the audiobook. not sure i would have enjoyed the book as much as I did hearing these stories told by the man himself. definitely some great nuggets in there too
37,@dingalingts @neemanaztv @garyvee @neemanaztv doesn’t miss. all of his characters/impersonations are on point. I was watching a Gary vid this morning that sounded more like neema than Gary 😂

41,@BeardedQueer @Pickillionaire @NickyBeaster absolutely a win win for both teams
42,@Pickillionaire @NickyBeaster Embiid and harden is going to be a crazy duo. Also sick that Philly was able to hang onto maxey and thybulle.
43,"@Pickillionaire @NickyBeaster 100%. Curry and Drummond add some crazy length to the bench too. I just find it interesting how bkn assembled a superteam that doesn’t necessarily gel on paper, and installed a 1st year head coach thinking he would make it work."
44,@Pickillionaire @NickyBeaster bruh I was about to post on your other thread about harden. good thing the nets have a proven and competent coach with a track record of getting the most out of his players…. 🥴🥴🥴

60,@coinbilly_ @creatureNFT @robotosNFT Welcome billy! Creature/roboto hodler here too. smart play scooping up both!
61,"also worth mentioning this has to do with my discontent towards project founders/leaders. for most people, myself included, securing WL is the best chance we have at accessing a project at an affordable price. weve all played this game to varying degrees. no shame in the grind"
62,@Libruary_NFT ts: quave
63,"@m0mburn definitely a fair way of looking at things!  a lot of the projects ive seen tend to limit a significant majority of supply for WL. i wouldn’t say i have an excess of time or money, so maybe im just salty🤷‍♂️"
64,@blindmarksman1 @ColdAngus why allocate funds to marketing initiatives when you have a dedicated hive of followers desperately trying to land WL &amp; will do all of the work for you? to no fault of their own though- also guilty of the grind. im concerned that this is now accepted as the norm for new entrants
65,@cur_ray @andrwwang can’t be beat!
66,"@staystacced it’s easy to lose sight of how far topshot has come in the past 12 months. OGs remember the constant delays, impossible to win ‘stress tests’, and regular website crashes. of all the lessons learned, patience was the most important 😂 these packs are hopefully worth the delay 🤞"
67,"the engagement farming for WL meta is really exhausting. new projects demand that you promote relentlessly, invite your entire social network to discord, and create a fan-art portfolio for the project, all for a shot at a WL role.

I miss the days of crank gwei ⛽️ and pray 🙏"
68,"@Benjamin23ts i would think most OG collectors would be willing to risk an extra couple bones for a  chance at a rare/legendary moment than purchase a pack full /60k moments worth $2. NFL AllDay structured their packs like that and I have to say, the premium is a cost im comfortable w/"
