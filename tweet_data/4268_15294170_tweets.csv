9,"@bbatsov Well, yes and no. It means that if you have nukes then we can only try non-kinetic stuff like basically everything we're doing to Russia."
10,This is weird. Twitter is showing me replies to a tweet from someone who has blocked me. We have a lot of the follows in common so maybe that's why the algo is doing this? Is this A Thing now?
11,"I respect Kasparov immensely, but this is a plea for the start of WW3. I have to object. Please, let's not do this. But maybe Kasparov is telling us that it has already started, so we should try to stop it before it spreads? If so, that is really grim."

15,"I hope this is all wrong, because if it's right then that's pretty grim and the main hope for the world now is that Putin is toppled by his own people and oligarchs."
16,"From Putin's POV per the speech, Ukraine is a NATO puppet regime &amp; NATO's plan is to encircle Russia &amp; give it the Iraq treatment. So by attacking Kyiv, he's already attacking NATO. The Rubicon is already crossed. Russia &amp; NATO are already at war."
17,"I think about the thread also in the context of this Putin speech, which you should read. Everything in the thread tracks w/ this speech. Also, it's clear Putin thinks that by going into Ukraine he's /already/ directly at war w/ NATO.  https://t.co/Sgu9NqxZGt"
18,"That said, it is very possible that his thread is correct about the Russian POV, &amp; that Russians are interpreting NATO reluctance to get directly, kinetically involved (no-fly, attacking convoys, etc.) as weakness that encourages them to push even harder. That would be maxium bad"
19,"Alternate take here from a Russian POV. I encourage you to read it. But I gotta point out that the fear expressed by myself, Judah, others, is not about ""not getting hurt."" It's about not getting nuked. Two different categories of things. https://t.co/NwcxJrIHkp"

39,"The ones who push this anti-civil-defense line -- that it's somehow pro-nuclear-war -- are the same innumerates who make kids do active shooter drills in schools. I should start telling them, ""active shooter drills are basically pro-mass shooting &amp; promote mass shooting culture."""

41,"Seriously man, nothing cheeses me off like the idea that if we take resilience and civil defense seriously, that will automatically mean we are chill with nuclear war &amp; therefore it'll be more likely. It's like saying if you buckle up you're more likely to get in a wreck. Morons."

45,"Ultimately, anything we've already done to them we've placed on the table as something they can do back as a proportional response (not an escalation). SWIFT has been hacked before. Could they shut it down? Could they freeze American or EU assets w/ cyber? Shut down our ATMs?"
46,"Of course, I don't want to oversell this because it's probably very unlikely. It would be EXTREMELY risky b/c we may be able to attribute it to them -- they may screw up the fake attribution to Ru -- &amp; then we'd attack them."
47,"A smaller, much weaker cyber adversary may reason that a nuclear exchange between Ru &amp; NATO would be dangerous but not catastrophic for it, &amp; would sort of level the global playing field (literally). So they could decide it's to their advantage to try &amp; spark one."
48,"Hoisting this from the thread b/c it's something I've been thinking about. As Ru &amp; NATO escalate, an opportunity opens for smaller enemies to use cyber + fake attribution + fog of war to try &amp; push both parties over the line into open war. https://t.co/m4JDM0ZuEX"
49,"Basically think of things that are disruptive &amp; economically damaging, but short of an open attack on the grid, &amp; that's what we could be in for as this escalates. Again, look at scenes of bank lines &amp; domestic chaos in Ru, &amp; expect them to try to replicate that here via cyber."
50,"To upshot of all this, is that the US's largest logistics company going offline last week due to ransomware is probably a preview of what Ru cyberattacks will look if/when they start in earnest. We could have problems w/ banking, commerce, travel, telecom. https://t.co/Uu13XdpECL"
51,"This attribution issue is even more critical if the attack is wider. Say the power goes out in the whole Northeast &amp; it's a regional catastrophe. This is an act of war &amp; we really really really gotta be sure that DPRK isn't playing a game of ""let's you &amp; him fight"" with us &amp; Ru."
52,"So imagine a cyberattack that cuts power to all of NYC. Is this an act of war? Like, do we risk nuclear escalation over this? Not only do we have to answer that, but we also have to ask: do we know the Russians really did this, &amp; not, say, North Korea or Iran?"
53,"Complicating all this is the issue of attribution. It's often quite difficult to firmly attribute a particular attack to an attacker. For instance, there was a recent story about the wiper malware used by Ru having a Chinese language conditional in it. 🤔"
54,"I imagine there will be other attacks on commerce, &amp; generally the idea will be to sow the kind of chaos over her that we've sown over there with our financial moves. We did it to them w/ SWIFT &amp; asset freezes, so they will approximate that w/ cyberattacks."
55,"Take the sanctions we're using against Ru. This is devastating but it's not turning off their grid. So they'll seek to respond proportionally, probably by attacking our banking &amp; payments system. It's tit-for-tat, but they're using the tools they have (= cyber)."
56,"If Ru takes down our power grid, or we take down theirs, our response will be the same as if they had taken out our grid w/ bombs. Likewise if we take out theirs. So when you're trying to game out what might happen, you look at things that fall short of the line of full-on war."
57,"On the calibration front, the attacker wants to cause maximum damage &amp; chaos without tipping over into the line of destroying critical infra &amp; killing a bunch of people, because that line is a clear casus belli &amp; then we're in MAD territory. So for instance, taking down the grid."
58,"I don't have a good explainer link, so seconding the request. That said, here's the way I've been thinking about this:

There are two issues with a cyberattack: calibration &amp; attribution. (Maybe more but these are the 2 I think about. Happy to hear others.) https://t.co/8UlB5afGAa"
