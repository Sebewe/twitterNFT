Gm, wagmi,
-RightClickSaveDAO"
28,"We’ve added many more great NFTs to our collection since then, but the work is far from over. 

We’re still improving our strategy, internal tools, processes, and learning from our mistakes. 

There is much left to be built in the world of DAOs."
29,"Of course! Why not jump in with both feet and buy a #CRYPTOPUNK 

Ever try minting directly from the Cryptopunk smart contract itself? By hand?

10 heart attacks later, #Punk2224 was ours. 

One day later, we bought a bored ape. #BAYC number 2701."
30,"Many meetings and many months later, we were ready. 

We had a dedicated group of admins, a reasonable but serious enough entry fee, a rough voting mechanism and many excited people. 

It was time for our first purchase."
31,"A handful of us got together, spun up a multisig smart contract wallet, drew up some documents, and called up as many lawyer friends as we could find. 

We had to do this right. 

Way more people wanted to join than we anticipated, we had to keep up with the demand!"
32,"There was something awe inspiring about these blue chip tier projects circulating in the market. 

At the time, most of the folks in our circle couldn’t afford to get in on the big fish like Cryptopunks or #BAYC by themselves. 

This was the perfect goal for us."
33,"Then one day, one of our founders got airdropped a #MAYC M3 mutant serum from @BoredApeYC 

What an excellent turn of events! Our group was really jazzed up. 

It was time to form the DAO, and NFTs seemed like the perfect thing to rally around."
34,"After much discussion about how we would either crash, build, or doge wrap a Lamborghini (somehow for charity), we ultimately decided that it wasn’t good for us or the community. 

But we liked the idea of giving/sharing something big!"
35,"A bit about us:

We were a group of friends casually chatting in discord about NFTs. 

We knew we wanted to start a DAO but had no idea what for. 

Our original idea was to crash a Lamborghini for charity.

..but maybe that wasn’t a great idea"
