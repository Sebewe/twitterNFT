57,@ninjasquadnft @NathanHeadPhoto @Loopifyyy
58,here we go 🚀 @ninjasquadnft
59,So a PoS NFT marketplace @LooksRareNFT is really brilliant. The power of blockchain and web3 industry is amazing.
60,@Loopifyyy @LooksRareNFT waiting for an exposure like $SOS. its gonna be rare
61,another airdrop for the nft space. $LOOKS great
62,Holding a mutant ape while you can hold a doodle? ngmi
63,@NathanHeadPhoto gas fees are going zero immediately when opensea is down lol
64,@NathanHeadPhoto we really need @Coinbase_NFT asap. opensea sucks
65,OpenSea is down again. They are struggling with this high demand. we need you ASAP! @Coinbase_NFT
66,"I am very welcomed by the @ninjasquadnft. Really nice community. You can earn passive income by holding Ninja with $NST token which is 1m mcap already. Can see this project climbing to 1 eth floor soon in this crazy NFT bull run. Going to swipe floor soon again🧹🧹

#NFTCommunity"
67,@IndifferentDuck is next @coolcatsnft 💎🙌
68,@Loopifyyy @greatmando_nft Taking profits after the $APE airdrop will be better option imo. I think the team will airdrop the coin based on how many Apes you hold and i don't think the floor will go to below 60eth till the airdrop.
