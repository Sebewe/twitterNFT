First, don't click any links from NFT twitter, especially DMs.

Second, be aware of what others are falling for.

Third, be overly cautious. Always. Free isn't free &amp; comes w a price

However, with the V1 drama, they shot themselves in the foot as V1 is more historically significant.  Since V2 has no other reason for upward momentum to exist, it's likely a zero over a longer time horizon.
