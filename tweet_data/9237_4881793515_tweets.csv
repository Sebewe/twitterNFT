Other marketplaces like @opensea w/ email notifications should learn from that. https://t.co/49C4UaFHIq"
62,"HD wallets only sign msg/txns. That isolates access of seedPhrases/pvtKeys from DApps or connected devices hence to protect wallet accounts.

64,"Still, if you can grab the airdrops safely. Go for it, it's free money anyway. But I think most ppl will revoke their approval of valuable NFTs to x2y2 after the claim. not a  smart move for x2y2."
65,"Wherever this goes, always good for new competitors to rise. Hope LooksRare and x2y2 keep evolving and bring new features to this long-no-innovation NFT market."
66,"So LooksRare was focused on their tokenomics at launch was a good decision for the timing. They gained market when OpenSea was unable to use and then improve their product.

However, x2y2 launch was nothing like LooksRare."
67,"x2y2 is too much focused on their token right now rather than the product itself.
LooksRare was not a ready product when it was launched but the timing was right, OpenSea constantly went down and many complaints from the users."
68,"Now they want you to list valuable NFTs to claim $x2y2 airdrop, and their official audit is not published.

I have no problem with Chinese team. Many projects are great. But also a lot of Chinese projects become scam and made bad reputations. So be careful."
69,"About x2y2, seems a project from Asia, likely Chinese team.
Domain registrant country is Japan, but that can be any country as the real owner wants it to be.

Discord:
many team members speak Chinese,
most OG members speak Chinese,
most whitelist role members speak Chinese."
