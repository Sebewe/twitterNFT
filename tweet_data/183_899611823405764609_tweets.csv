26,"@YuserXyz Hi hi, stars invited?"
27,@LarpKiller @StarcatchersNFT @Beutrec @ethmaurice @Kamedez @RovyETH Just my take 🙌
28,@ssssizumu @StarcatchersNFT I am a huge fan of under promise and over deliver. I have trust in the team to build this brand and make a name for them selves. Honestly prefer this over the copy pasta roadmaps that 85% of projects have these days.
29,@casperdefi @StarcatchersNFT The only space star 🌟💫 https://t.co/PxSjD5mN1X
30,@ThePossessedNFT Congrats to everyone 🤩
31,"11/ TLDR: We 🌟 Love 🌟 The 🌟 Starcatchers 🌟
Note: I own two Starcatchers as of right now.
Remember to DYOR and this is not financial advice.
Post your stars below saying what you like about the Starcatchers.
🌟💫"
32,"10/ Why buy a Starcatcher?
Art is simply one of the best in the space and founders locked up a big portion of the minting revenue. Who doesn't love a team that is comitted to building something long term? https://t.co/Xo1eiXDyok"
33,"9/ Starhopper &amp; Starfetcher
These cuties round up the post perfectally. What more needs to be said, just take a look for yourself. https://t.co/sGGHefW8N1"
34,"8/ Head &amp; Accessory
So if this wasn't enough to build your Starcatcher there are a variations Accessories to pick from &amp; a bunch of different ""Heads"". Some not being stars 👀
Here are some of my favorites. https://t.co/q6lARCZUsa"
35,"7/ Hat
The hats are no exception, looking at floor there are already a big variation to pick from and no specific trait that people dont like.(important imo) They all fit so well with the base character &amp; same goes with animated traits here. https://t.co/GIxoYmmjB1"
36,6/ Here are just a few I found by browsing the collection. This makes for a really fun experience when looking for a starcatcher. (twitter wont let me post a bunch of gifs so look for these traits if you want to see what it looks like) https://t.co/KP6AIqjitd
37,"5/ Body
Lost for words looking at the different traits for the body. There is really something for everyone. Fun, good looking &amp; clean art all the way. On top of everything to choose from, there are animated ones too. https://t.co/qZlQd5mBdM"
38,"4/ This makes for a very nice variations of the same animated trait. 
What about the backgrounds without ""bling""?
Theres a big selection to pick from and really makes your starcatcher pop. Here are a few just looking at floor. https://t.co/q5Lq3svbDE"
39,"3/ Backgrounds. 
Scrolling through the collection you will notice that the background game is nothing that should be overlooked, and @Beutrec definitely didn't. On top of the amazing backgrounds there is also ""Bling"" which are animated traits added on top of the background. https://t.co/TEnBb9MS91"
40,"2/ Starcatcher is a collection of 10,000 generative stars (mostly👀). At first glance its clear that the project is unique and art is original. But lets dive a little deeper into what it is built up by."
41,"1/ Why @StarcatchersNFT is a blue chip in the making 🧵

Starcatchers is a art based NFT by @Beutrec and ran with @ethmaurice, @Kamedez &amp; @RovyETH.
They are community-driven project with the intensions to develop a brand that represents the values of their community."

70,@OG_HADDOCK @MetaRaccoon @0xCase_eth @AngelClarkSays @DottiTopShot @MShitstain @MERICAN_RADASS @TheMoroccanApe Don't mind the way they do it. Better way of paying for some of the marketing rather than huge influencer pumps being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars
