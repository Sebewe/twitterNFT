12,"There will be winners and losers within Treasure, but I’m committed to educating + onboarding as many people I can to the ecosystem not only to share in its success, but also partake in building and fleshing out its expansive universe."
13,"All this to say and as mentioned before, I am super bullish on the @Treasure_DAO ecosystem. The team and community have been top notch and are extremely passionate about building a decentralized, interconnected, multi-metaverse that weaves together."
14,"All of this may be super confusing to newcomers so if anyone wants further insight or have questions, my DMs are always open🙂 I also recommend reading this great thread by @branavann regarding his outlook on the relationship between $MAGIC and NFTs.
https://t.co/mR72wKAb8l"
15,"...but they can also permanently break during crafting which adds a deflationary mechanism. Treasures will also be incorporated in many upcoming projects including SoL, giving them additional utility."
16,"D) Treasures
By far the cheapest entry into the ecosystem in terms of NFTs. Treasures allow for a staking boost for $MAGIC, and is also used in crafting in BW. All treasures except Honeycomb and Grin can increase in supply as Legions receive them as Quest rewards..."
17,"SoL will receive 50% of all $MAGIC emissions for the first 2 weeks. It's also led by @jumpmanft and @notrealend, both who are highly respected in the community. Will share more of my thoughts after reading the WP tomorrow but the early teasers for SoL have looked promising."
18,"C) SoL
Seed of Life is still shrouded in a lot of mystery, but has its Whitepaper dropping tomorrow which should explain a lot its gameplay and how it plans to incorporate $MAGIC/Treasures. Many have compared it to an on-chain WoW game that follows your seed throughout its life."
19,"but with constantly evolving game theory and supply dynamics, I expect this to be fluid. Being the flagship game of Treasure, I expect Bridgeworld to continue to do well given the demand/# of players sees healthy growth, which should help the ROI on all aspects of gameplay."
20,"The gameplay mechanic is extensive, but basically the different actions listed above will earn you various rewards (extra legion, treasure, harvester parts, etc) but will require varying amounts of time and $MAGIC. Currently, the ROI for summoning has been extremely high -"
21,"B) Bridgeworld 
This is the flagship game of Treasure that includes a ton of game theory. Below is a photo of the different paths you can take to be involved in the game. Buying a Genesis or Aux Legion (with varying rarities) allows you to Quest, Summon, Craft in Bridgeworld. https://t.co/RYbihcWQ9F"
22,"Smol Brains especially have become a culture play for the Treasure community, which arguably has one of the strongest communities. Brains/Bodies also receive WL spots for many future projects on Treasure and will receive boosted $MAGIC emissions in Q2, adding to their utility."
23,"A) Smolverse - Brains + Bodies
Both of these are great entries into the Treasure ecosystem with Smol Brains being the genesis project. The team is building out an expansive universe with lore and much utility for both projects that includes smolcoin, breeding, land, gameplay, etc"
24,"It is important to note that there are plenty of upcoming projects on Treasure including but not limited to: @BattleFlyGame, @PeekABooGameNFT, @toadstoolzNFT, @ShogunWarNFT and many more. Many of these are still offering WL spots for a free mint so I recommend looking into them."
25,"2) NFTs
For those who would like to be more involved in gameplay or want direct exposure to specific projects, buying an NFT may be the better choice. I'll be breaking this down into 4 projects that are currently on the Marketplace: Smolverse, Bridgeworld, SoL, and Treasures."
26,"By staking, you are also earning an APR, allowing you to earn more $MAGIC. This is also a great option for those who simply want to stack up on $MAGIC to jump into future Treasure projects that may look much more appealing to them than the current ones."
27,"This route likely has the most downside protection while still offering much upside. Think about it as investing in an in-game $NINTENDO currency that can be used across all games rather than characters from individual games like Mario, Zelda, or Pokemon."
28,"1) MAGIC
For many newcomers to Treasure with smaller budgets, my (non-financial) advice is to usually just buy and stake $MAGIC. This is the best option for those who don't have the time/energy to research individual NFT projects, but still want exposure to Treasure as a whole."
29,One of the biggest dilemmas for many people is whether to simply buy + hold/stake $MAGIC or buy Treasure NFTs. I want to delve into the pros/cons of each option and also breakdown the different NFTs to help people choose how they want to be exposed to the ecosystem.
30,"Since my last post on $MAGIC and @Treasure_DAO, I've been getting a lot of questions on the best way to get exposure to the ecosystem. Below is a 🧵 of my own insights on how to jump in. All of these thoughts are simply my opinions so please DYOR and NFA 🙂"
31,"Another great video as usual. We def need to smarten up collectively and make a push to educate the newcomers to the space. @GiancarloChaux is prob one of the few leaders in this space I can fully trust.

35,@ArcanicNFT You too! Thank you for all you're doing for the treasure community you buildoooor 🙏
36,"@ArcanicNFT Sorry Arcanic, here is a late GM"
37,"@DiscoverXnft Possible good short term play, bad long term play imo"
38,Obviously LooksRare needed seed funding to hit the ground running and compete against OS but I'm sure this leaves a sour taste in many people's mouths esp in a space preaching decentralization and 'WAGMI'. This is why I'm extra bullish on @Treasure_DAO and what they're building. https://t.co/EPN8I5x9MN

73,"They are always first to congratulate other teams' successes, and always respond to accusations/FUD with humility. As true pioneers, they have worked incessantly to bring value to holders and at the same time, also given a lot back to charity."
74,"A short appreciation 🧵 on the @BoredApeYC founders in light of the recent dox situation.
