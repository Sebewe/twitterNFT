3,"TradFi Vent:
It’s crazy how I can buy a 3 month Treasury Bill yielding 0.39% but bank savings programs are still only yielding 0.01% (and Bank CDs are only yielding 0.2%).  
These spreads are outrageous, hopefully it narrows overtime. Risk averse savers deserve some yield lol"
4,@TheShipIsMoving I played so much NCAA Basketball video games growing up I know 98% of D1 school mascots lol
5,Tiers 3 &amp;4 are needed to produce any of three items while crafting (and outstanding supply is way less than T5). Best to buy the cheapest item of a tier because crafting recipe is currently indifferent to the specific item used. https://t.co/cCu2UYyblt
6,"My thoughts on MAGIC’s treasure and consumables market since crafting has gone live:

Consumables: am I missing something or are small prisms super undervalued?  The cost of crafting one far exceeds the current market price
 
Treasures: load up on the cheapest tier 3 &amp; 4 items"

12,"@6Foot4Honda Hodl, the market is flooded with treasures right now. I think treasure values will go up when crafting goes live"

Are you locking some of your MAGIC in the mine too?"
17,"Gonna start liquidating my L1 NFT portfolio (minus Doodles, Capsule House and Stapleverse). Next decision is figuring out how to keep liquid vs how much to roll into the MAGIC ecosystem.  Love the potential for NFTs on Arbitrum"

25,6) hopefully we can look back at this prediction a year from now and lol at it.
26,5) if more trusted global payment networks begins to achieve widespread adoption it will cause major anxiety for the US and threaten the dollars status as the reserve currency of the world. This situation could unfold rather quickly (approx 3 years) if Russia does invade Ukraine
27,4) maybe this will spur crypto adoption and utilization on a national level. This could happen long term. Short term I think the global payment network will start to fragment and there will be more than 5 or more trusted options to transfer money outside of the SWIFT network.
28,3) I think that a majority of the world will look negatively on the US excluding Russia from the SWIFT payment network. Nations and foreign banks will start to seriously consider using alternative methods for transferring money around the globe.
29,2) I don’t think that the US will “ban” crypto or fiat on ramps. I do think the US will try to “ban” Centralized Exchanges from allowing users to transfer their assets “on chain”.  I think this could happen regardless of the Russia situation. Now back to geopolitics…
30,1) Prediction time: if Russia does invade Ukraine and the U.S. unilaterally decides to exclude Russia from the SWIFT payment network it will be the catalyst for heavy handed crypto regulation coming out of Washington in the name of “national security”.
31,"Got my mom on mainnet, she was not stoked to learn about gas fees. 
Can’t wait for easy L2 on ramps directly from CEXs"
