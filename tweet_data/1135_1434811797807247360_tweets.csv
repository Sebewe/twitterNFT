13,"One nft project even demanded that I'd shill their nft to my followers because they felt I was responsible for a mistake someone else on their team made. It was very uncomfortable

I refused to do it because I value my followers"

32,@brycent_ @Syberer @Pixelmon Ask him about refunding people. People want their money back.
33,"@Nate_Rivers Would've been cheaper for you to buy the Unity asset stock model for $60. Deploy a contract, upload them to IPFS and sell a Kevin collection. That way you'd at least own them instead you paid a few grand for a digital receipt. But yeah ..."
34,@NFTLlama Wen refund?

67,"Thank you for reading 🧡 Researching &amp; writing these threads take a lot of time

Share &amp; retweet this thread to spread awareness"
68,".. if you're crying because you're 1 of the ppl who bought at 3E and are now sitting on a $7366 loss per #nft

Maybe this video of @Syberer crying irl eases the pain a lil. May want to save it before he deletes it ...
https://t.co/Tn8V9Ujd3u"
69,"3d) So @syberer earned $70m by

- buying cheap stock Unity models
- converting them to voxel assets
- making a one-page site
- got @deltadevelopers onboard for % share
- and selling them for 3E per nft

He has no team, there's no game, this kid has no idea what he's doing. But..."
70,"3f) Syberer has no trackrecord in blockchain, nfts or game dev. Yet promised an amazing Pokémon-clone game &amp; somehow convinced solidity devs @deltadevelopers to get onboard

I assume they didn't do their DD however some ppl say the devs knew 👇👇 https://t.co/orelMRBcq8"
71,"3e) Btw that cool banner used on Syberer's Minecraft page was was created by artist @MathieuBeaulieu for youtuber MogiTheGreat

Seems like he simply removed Mogi's name and didn't give credit to the artist/owner

Which also sounds familiar ... https://t.co/nY1jbrjun6"
72,"3d) Coincidentally @PixelmonMod is a very popular Minecraft mod that lets you capture, breed and evolve Pokémon. Sound familiar? https://t.co/pyFcstefpI"
73,3c) When you follow the trail of failed Kickstarters you find his full name and address. Not really any detective work since he willingly doxxed himself to become a Minecraft streamer. Where he routinely streamed for donations: https://t.co/6GkbPOQnyq
74,"3b) The worst being Slap the Deck, where he got it 100% funded but after receiving the funds rugged because the funds he calculated weren't enough to begin with. Like what the actual f*ck 🤷 https://t.co/sqVRn6OCaj"
75,"3a) So who is @Syberer? Taking a closer look we find that he has a history of Kickstarters that've not delivered on their promises

He kickstarted Altar Watches, Psycho Chickens &amp; Slap the Deck. All flooded with complains of never receiving the products 👇 https://t.co/A8n296TtYR"
76,"2d) That's cause Pixelmon are fully centralized nfts. The ""art"" and data is stored on their own site

At least its less bad than their OG collection which was created using OpenSea's storefront .. https://t.co/1Ls0WyfxwY"
77,"2c) Also not sure why the original Pixelmon wallet was sending out 42 free Pixelmon nfts to random wallets. Could be nothing, could be something. But afaik this wasn't announced

Not that it really matters since you don't own your Pixelmon nfts anyway ... https://t.co/fsd1a8CRiK"
78,2b) But again don't take my word (or the blockchain) for it. He proudly admits this 🤦‍♂️🤦 https://t.co/fCV90OTPLd
79,"2a) But its all good! After apologizing he promised to spend $2mil of investors money to ""fix"" the stock art he bought! 

However the blockchain shows the 1st thing he did was spend 280E on BAYC, Azuki &amp; CloneX nfts. Swapped out $1.3M &amp; sent another 13E to an exchange 👇👇 https://t.co/r7MYOhySD3"
80,1g) Some ppl even claim that Syberer copied the game from this indie game dev and used it as the base for his Pixelmon demo:https://t.co/mFY6ipJifd
81,"1f) He then hired artist @MalberShart (who does NOT endorse nfts btw) to work on them for LESS than the price of a single Pixelmon mint. And Syberer never told the artists it was for nfts

If he'd known he probably wouldn't have done the work. Absolute scum behavior ... https://t.co/EezjIjky3f"
82,"1e) Turns out he bought stock models (by MeshTint Studio) for 159usd and converted them to voxel assets
 
But don't take my word for it. Here's @syberer actually admitting it 👇 https://t.co/VKXhpPPklV"
83,"1d) Here is a side by side comparison of what was promised vs what was delivered. Some models even were straight up broken

Anyone asking $8500 per #nft knowing this is straight up scamming ppl. So what's going on? https://t.co/z873eXyPda"
84,"1c) Eventually on the 25th Pixelmon revealed their true designs and Oh Lordi, I wish they didn't😱

I didn't even mint any and I want my money back! 

Here's what buyers got 👇👇 https://t.co/xVOSo8fuvy"
85,"1b) The reveal was Feb 16th. Which they pushed to the 23rd cause they needed ""additional time integrating metadata into OpenSea"". However, you don't integrate metadata into OS. That's not how it works

More likely they needed time to make REAL assets"
86,"1a) Pixelmon was created by @Syberer who made big promises about amazing looking 3D art for his upcoming game. This made Pixelmon sell out their 3E per nft Dutch Auction &amp; generated $70M in sales

No roadmap, trackrecord or reputation. Ofc it sold out! 

What happened next? https://t.co/EvftdZMVJZ"
87,"Before we start know that this thread has limited space so I'm only covering main issues. My analysis covers:

1) The whole ""art"" reveal
2) What was done with the funds
3) Who is Syberer?
