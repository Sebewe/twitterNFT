70,"It starts by formalizing the @OlympusDAO protocol, making a few simplifications.

It then proceeds to formally describe: staking and bonding."
71,It seems that providing multiple locking periods (for the bonders) helps with price stability.
72,The paper mostly focuses on how to adjust the parameters for these actions such that it optimizes for different metrics.
73,"A user can also provide liquidity by depositing another asset (USD, ETH) and $OHM to a market maker (such as @Uniswap or @SushiSwap).

The difference is the LP tokens representing the liquidity share they own, are locked for different periods of time.

Such a user is a ""bonder""."
74,"A user that stakes $OHM earns a pro-rata portion of the inflation.

Staking means that the tokens are less liquid, thus the protocol can adjust for how much staking it desires by inflating the non-staked tokens more/less."
75,". @OlympusDAO was the first to marry these aspects related to liquidity provisioning:

- buy
- lease
- rent"
76,"More info about the @feiprotocol PCV
https://t.co/aVMCSuoq0O"
77,"This brings us to the 2021 concept of Protocol Owned Liquidity.

@feiprotocol made this idea popular with their concept of Protocol Controlled Value (PCV). 

The PCV:
- provided more FEI on buy when price &lt; $1
- burned some FEI on sell when price &lt; $1"
78,An additional incentive was they also provided Convex tokens on top of the Curve rewards. Forcing the users to deposit through Convex since it offered more gains.
79,"Because the Curve tokens were used to vote on how the reward distribution is executed, the Convex protocol had a big share of the voting power.

This allowed the Convex users to earn more rewards compared to the Curve users since it could vote on the pools it was staking on."
80,"Having a way to vote on rewards made it possible for @ConvexFinance  to play a new game.

They created a protocol that was able to earn by staking Curve tokens."
81,"However, these additional incentivization boosts were configurable by the protocol token owners, not by a more ""pure"" method.

The values were being voted on, instead of being a function of market activity and volume."
82,The AMM platforms @CurveFinance and @SushiSwap provided incentives for liquidity providers that stayed for longer periods in the protocol.
83,"However, this attracts mercenary capital that farms your token, and when another more profitable yield opportunity presents itself, it goes away.

Because this capital is not a user in your system, it will also push the price down.

https://t.co/pM9jMAYzPv"
84,"The 👩🏼‍🌾 farmer is also incentivized to provide the LP tokens obtained by depositing the token and another asset (USD, ETH) as stake for even more staking rewards.

This way, new users have an available pool to use in order to enter or exit the system.

https://t.co/RSgWe0JPwE"
85,"As opposed to the 3 methods linked above, the 👨‍🌾 yield farming is a different way to distribute tokens to the community.

When farming one does not buy the tokens, but farms them by temporarily staking some asset for a while and receiving the token in exchange."
