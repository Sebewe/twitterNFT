1,@cobie @Upwork Upworks entire business model is locking undervalued slaves into contracts. You best believe their legal team is close to half of their entire work force.

3,"@gainzxbt I feel like gainzy is super active on the PUA forums, specifically under the “peacocking” threads."
4,"@HelenaJaczek The legal protest didn’t force anyone to close anything, they were sent a letter by the federal government to close their doors and this was to try and starve the protestors of resources."
5,@MaximusLennox @mrharrycanary @JustinTrudeau The businesses were shut down by the city officials not the protestors. The businesses that stayed open have done very well.

13,@hamrockOG @clif_high You read well over 100 studies and you think that the reason the therapy is effective is because it’s a “laser” lmfao.. https://t.co/HX0liW7nil https://t.co/kkLFUZEJWq
14,"@hamrockOG @clif_high This is way over your head eh.. this guy thinks the regular leds used as a placebo in studies are the same used in the joovv devices.. Ye buddy all LEDs are the exact same, same amount of power used, same wavelengths/frequencies and photons emitted .. all the same..tard."
15,@hamrockOG @clif_high What is a laser??? It's a light.. are you dense?
16,"@hamrockOG @clif_high Ya it’s not really about the type of light, it’s about the wavelength and photon intensity."
17,"@hamrockOG @clif_high LLLT uses either coherent light sources (lasers) or non-coherent light sources consisting of filtered lamps or light-emitting diodes (LED) or, on occasion, a combination of both."
18,@clif_high thx homie
19,@clif_high Is there any portable lights that you can buy that would simulate this? It’s too fkn cold here to sun them.

78,@lindyape It's incredible to think how mind-blowingly different your night will be based on this decision. It could literally mean the difference between you pulling a 9 or a soft 6. The universe will take into account how you choose and adjust your reality accordingly. Choose wisely
