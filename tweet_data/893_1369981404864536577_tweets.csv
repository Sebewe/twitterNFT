30,@ISombres I'd also add the are elements of exceptionalism in the russian culture that have long history that affect this approval and are used quite effectively by Putin.
31,@ISombres there's always an element of collabration between the autocrat and the society. During communism in our case the regime was composed of true believers and patriots and the party had millions of members some opportunists of course but still.
32,@ISombres you guys do realize that his current approval rate is 71% right? granted that is partly due to the lack of information and propaganda but since 1999 it doesn't drop below 60%. Blanket methods are not the answer but he wasn't imposed form the outside.
