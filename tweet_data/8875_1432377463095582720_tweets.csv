4,@gagewinthrop Maybe we need to FUD the timeline to get out the weak hands and accumulate
5,@kevimlee Whatcha talking about mfer?
6,"@ElDolce_ This is awesome. If you need any writing help, lemme know ;) I’ve got some experience with conversion writing and landing pages"
7,@ElDolce_ Oh cool. Is this Shopify style plug and play?
8,@ElDolce_ Why nft gated?
9,@cryptobiatch @sartoshi_nft It’s amazing to see what these mfers are building
10,"@gagewinthrop @GlatchByGage These are sick, can’t wait to get my print :)"
11,"Love to derivatives, but I’m curious what else you’re building 🤔

What non-derivative projects have mfers made?"
12,@ElDolce_ @fame_ladies @fortuna_dao @YearoftheWoman_ @nft_shiny are looking amazing. Plus no WL grind
13,Snagged one of these dope @GlatchByGage generative pieces. Can’t wait to get my free print 👀 https://t.co/y7O2D5ND4C
14,@gagewinthrop @kevimlee @GlatchByGage Snagged one mfer. These are sick and I’ve been needing some new wall art https://t.co/l847unxvZ1
15,@gagewinthrop @kevimlee @GlatchByGage Only .01 eth and a free print? good looking out
16,Mfer derivative game is too strong 😂 https://t.co/DekwT12EiC
17,@kevimlee @gagewinthrop The color. The structure. Damn
18,@Sepp064 This might be the best fit tbh
19,@iBuyFUD Name checks out
20,@currymfer Either of them would be fire. Or Frank Ocean!
21,@nft_bonedaddy @Cryptorules2017 @mcuban He really is a true mfer

26,@mferbots Rolling a blunt lmao
27,@BobbyBananasNFT Bobby Cabanas
28,@FoleyConor What are the top two? Those are fun
29,I like to think that even the mfers with hoodies aren’t wearing pants https://t.co/ZU0hUdfB62
30,@mc_travor @sartoshi_nft Congrats on the new mfer ❤️
31,@strangersolemn LFG! https://t.co/aHRAHIHmUS
32,@kevimlee Live action mfer movie is inevitable
33,@kevimlee Too few blunts imo
34,"@artbyblizzy These are dope, I’d cop if you made a collection"
35,@stitchnft Thanks for the update! Looking forward to showing off the new swag
36,"@stitchnft yo I ordered last Wednesday and haven’t heard anything about shipping, any updates? 

My order # is 3649"
37,@0xCato Will you take .3 WETH?

51,"@dantezinpherno These the knockoffs bro, check out @azukimfers"
52,"Coinbase commercial was iconic, can’t believe they threw it together last minute https://t.co/0MYTLRfLXr"
53,"We’re all mfers at heart. So when mfers use CC0 to make a cool new project, they’re not making a knockoff. They’re allowing more people to become mfers.

As more and more people use *any* mfer as their PFP, the OG collection will increase in historical value. https://t.co/5zZfW6eWVW"
54,"“Derivatives” doesn’t sound quite right for mfer projects. They’re not knockoffs, they’re pure expressions of creativity.

What could we call mfer projects that’s not so loaded?"
55,Mfers will be the first project to meme their way to blue chip status
56,"RT @adarigin: @sartoshi_nft Jump in people, asap. Mr @sartoshi_nft so whats our plan this christmas ? Should we all #mfers meet ? I wonder…"
57,"For us, derivatives aren’t a knockoff — they’re the whole point.

Each derivative project we create shares our community with others and brings people together. 

Let’s fucking build, mfers."
58,"Mfers aren’t an exclusive yacht club.

We’re something different.

We know there’s 8 billion mfers on this planet. Sartoshi only made 10,000. 

We’ve got a lot of work to do."
59,"Browsing web3 sites is actually…fun.

It’s crazy how cool the internet is without adhd-inducing ads 🤯"

76,"Mfers chilling with the blue chips in volumes

We’re seeing a lot of resistance at 3eth but steady volume. Breakout soon or are we chilling here for a bit? 

Either way, cozy. https://t.co/FLkvm8l1xf"
77,"@mfer8761 If it’s anything like the journey from 2 eth to 3 eth, we may touch 4 (hopefully 4.2) before consolidating around 3 or 3.5"

89,@gweigamer Working on it now mfer 📖
90,"@CloutedMind Could hard code in royalties for incubated projects. 

Mfers get value + help support creators, creators get the resources needed to launch at scale"
91,"We can grow the mfer treasury to incubate new community projects. This drives value to all mfers.

This is how we could: https://t.co/SULbxMu8LX"
92,"@CloutedMind Maybe the DAO could be *official* and approve projects *officially* if the DAO is formed democratically, with 5,001+ mfers having to vote for its creation."
93,"@CloutedMind Agreed, I think it's important to grow the mfer treasury for the project to thrive. DAO seems necessary.

But there's an issue of mfers already being in public domain. How do we approve derivatives if it's open season?"

Could become a DAO that offers better terms than labels traditionally do"
