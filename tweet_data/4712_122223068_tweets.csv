1,Web 3 isn’t a bubble. It’s a rush
2,@cryptycoon 💯
3,@JackSitt Lolllll J
4,@RachelNathanCA Yes. but also the ethos of web3/crypto (to me) is to have systems that are transparent (blockchain) and encourage inclusion/ working towards a common goal... This whitelist stuff creates exclusivity + uses predatory marketing tactics in many cases
5,"The people learning about crypto from ""grinding on to a whitelist"" of an nft project are really getting the wrong first impression of what we're trying to build with Web 3"
6,@KPMG_Canada @worldofwomennft epic
7,Web 3 Landscape growing by the minute. So many projects being built wow... Research by @ArcaneResearch https://t.co/mbb6wTC9eD

12,"@joshbobrowsky Shoot me a dm and we can scehdule a zoom to discuss. It's a bit complex, but basically it all comes down to a formula 1 mfer= 1mfer. There are people much smarter than me in the discord that can explain. Some lectures and dissertations etc on this topic."

14,"@Goltra this is absurd, wow"
15,Happy to have met an iconic young artist  @fewocious at Sotheby's this week. Even happier to confirm that Fewo is one of the nicest people I've met in the nft space. Winning in life and still spreading positive  + humble vibes to every single person he meets 😃😃 https://t.co/FfKIYoAmzq

35,"@NFTethics This account is usually good, but this feels like irritable cancel culture directed at someone who is doing so much good in the space. its pretty clear that he had an art gallery selling collectible bongs LOL u make it seem like the guy was selling organs on the black market.."

48,"The VC investors that invested in whatsapp, instagram, Zoom, and Youtube just launched a $500-600M fund for liquid tokens + digital assets..... Regardless of how you feel abut VC money in the Web 3 space, I think this is a reminder that we are still early fam #wagmi https://t.co/ZeAL5h5Nyx"

56,I love this! I'll add:3 ways to learn in web3 without losing money 1) Download coinbase and take their quiz's. Make a few $100 a month for watching vids. 2) Mint NFT's that cost zero dollars+make friends in the discord (can do this on @arbitrum) 3) Watch ALL of @coinbureau videos https://t.co/zWQSUdYWfI

60,"@punk9059 @worldofwomennft @YaristotleGMI @lisaplcp123 @itsorawan @leslieGMI @crypto_steves @raphfac @CryptoFungii @WoWPixiesNFT @socialdiva No idea. They easily could have done it for a while now, and they announced Galaxy of women when the floor was 2! So my guess is they are waiting for the perfect time."
61,"Lots of people dont realize this. @worldofwomennft  announced an extension of Wow, called Galaxy of Women, similar to Mutants for BAYC. The goal? 1) remain inclusive 2)bring in more awesome ppl to the community 3)Bring value to WoW holders...IMO I do not think this is “priced in” https://t.co/q1feapflUa"

66,@jacksettleman Yellow cabs are the answer! Uber is really the worst.
67,@iamDCinvestor Are there any governance tokens you think have created good tokenomics to incentivize community building + price appreciation?
68,"For every transaction on the Ethereum network we pay a “gas fee”. A portion of the fees are taken out of circulation or “burned”.  314,669 Ethereum coins were burned in the past 30 days (~1bil USD) 🦇🔊 https://t.co/dWlkHdIy5M"

99,"DeFi offers ppl 5+% on their USD vs. banks &lt;1%.NFT’s allow creators to more effectively monetize their creations with smart contracts.Blockchain gaming+social graphs turn the “users” into “owners”... Yes ""Web3"" has MANY hypocrisies, but the developments are so exciting :) :) :)"
