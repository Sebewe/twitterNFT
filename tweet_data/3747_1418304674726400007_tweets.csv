70,Remember that passion is what drives my best work and I can accomplish anything. People will believe in me because I have won and I have lost. ❤️
71,"I'm close to moving up again in my day job. I'm really good at what I do. And all I can think about is this project. Thank you for reading to the end. My plans will come together and it will be truly innovative. This time, from experience, I will... 👇"
72,"I've been through celeb rugs, I've been through NFT drouts, I've spent over 50ETH in volume. And I believe now I have a plan that isn't just a opportunistic money grab. But a real shot. 👇"
73,"I just built cool shit and the money came later. Now I'm a realtor, I'm a manager of IT security at a major company (making bank), I'm a father and provider. And all I can fucking think about is NFTs and building cool shit. 👇"
74,"I've been chasing money ever since. After 10+ years I learned what got me there was where I started. Chasing a vision, a dream of building cool shit so relentlessly that I didn't care if people wanted to hang out. Didn't care if I had other plans. I stay up all night building. 👇"
75,But I didn't keep innovating. I was young and had more money than I could imagine spending. And about a year after I started my well started to dry up. Facebook took over and devs were everywhere. 👇
76,It was life changing money and pulling in 1k to 3k a week after was nuts to my ego. I built an elaborate way to make sure my apps hit the Top apps and had 30k+ installs in a week... 👇
77,Not long after I started following his advice and built app over app making 7k in first week. My parents thought it was bullshit. But I had it in a PayPal account before I even told them and that shit was real. They got me a bank account... 👇
78,One day another dev reached out to asked me to add something I made in one of my apps to their app with 1000s of users. I got $50 to add a script I built and it was an amazing day. Then I asked him how he got ads on his app and how he got so many users...👇
79,When apps came out I realized this is even cooler than my custom profiles. Flash games were cool back then and I built my first apps around being a gaming type app. 👇
80,I learned to code because I wanted to make an original MySpace profile template. All the famous people had cool customized skins showcasing their music. I learned HTML and JavaScript by making my profile coolest of my friends. 👇
81,"I was 15 when I made my first 100k USD. I was one of first to join MySpace devs and made over 50 apps. One over 200k installs. Got caught up in money instead of my original dream and passion of building cool shit...
