27,"Now the thing is, the values used in this off-chain check can be spoofed. And maybe in fact they should, with values that look more in line with regular transactions.

30,Why do we care? Because that makes it possible to have contract code display some data to a frontend (like a rate/price/royalties %) but actually bait-and-switch with different data when the transaction lands on-chain.
31,"Ever wondered what values like msg.sender and tx.gasprice are when you're in a view function?

34,"@isiain @ourZORA But that means it's up to the marketplace to interpret that payout ""request"" and cap it to something that's at least legal (like 100% in Zora's case), or even lower to something more ""usual"".

46,"@zak_krevitt Hey Zak! It's kind of hard to explain in a tweet but I'll give it a try 😅

61,"Quick reminder: as a user, always double check the suggested gas price before sending a transaction.
