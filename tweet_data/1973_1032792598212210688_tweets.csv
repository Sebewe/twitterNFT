46,There is a ton that happens in this space so I may have forgotten some important parts but I’ve just wanted to establish myself to the Twitter community more formally than I have in the past and say thank you. I’m excited for the things to come.
47,I’m excited for native L2 projects like @Zip_swap @vestafinance @Treasure_DAO to grow in the future. Already solns have shown promise and pushed innovation beyond what we’ve seen to date. Seeing how nft platforms establish themselves on L2 will be something special @tofuNFT  👀
48,"Of course @optimismPBC. Having multiple solns to scalability is important and while optimism has shown that gas fees may be slightly higher, the team is unmatched and the people are amazing. Their contributions over the years have made Ethereum into what it is today."
49,"To wrap this up, I only will be minting on Ethereum and Ethereum roll ups as I value security, decentralization and the community. I am very excited for L2 solns like @Immutable @arbitrum @0xPolygon (which is sidechain now but has expressed interest in roll ups in future) and…"
50,I’m really excited as recently I was invited into the @withFND community of artists by @PabloPunkasso. Having been invited by Pablo is really special to me because pablos collection and curated @oncyber_xyz has inspired me a great deal over the recent months.
51,My goal is to aspire to creating high quality artwork and over the past few years I’ve been meticulously scrutinizing my work. I finally feel that I’m at a point that the artwork can truly speak for itself and I hope collectors will love it.
52,"While thinking of my experiences in the space, I’d be remise not to mention @nansen_ai in this journey. The office hours have been a truly special part of my journey into the space and the tool has really made deep dives fun."
53,For the reason that their teams are on the bleeding edge of creating innovative projects. Their teams are are knowledgeable hold values and principles similar to what I defined earlier.

55,"I have spent the past 2-3 years diving into cgi, animation, motion design and the graphic arts. Around the time that I began working on this, I came to realize Ethereum is the future and picked up motiondesign.eth. All my art will be minted from this address"
56,Resources like @BanklessHQ @ethhub_io @ethdotorg have been such a great way to keep current and stay safe while using DeFi. Taking time to review past posts is truly worth the time.
57,There have been projects in the community which I have grown to love such as @gitcoin @Uniswap @SushiSwap @balancer @iearnfinance. Learning about DeFi has been a full time job. Not only do you need to stay current in the space but you need to establish a financial plan.
58,Before I begin my journey creating nfts. I want to share a little about myself. I haven’t rushed to nfts but learned about the community. I’ve focused adopting principles https://t.co/Bznjc4GQop and learning from passionate individuals in the community.
