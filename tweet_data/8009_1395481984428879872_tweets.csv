72,Ilya's artwork is amongst the most striking on tezos for me. https://t.co/Pq8avVBJt7
73,"4/ Every element of his creations has its own story and invites the observer to take up the narrative, to tell it along and on. And isn't that what art is all about, to leave the usual path of language and challenge the audience? Thank you @Gossip_Goblin! https://t.co/B52bSPwdDN"
74,"3/ Fascinating is the obsession with detail, the colours, the motifs and finally a whole cosmos of characters, glyphs and scenes, tied into a grand narrative, in short a language of its own and it's all handpainted! I think the images speak for themselves. https://t.co/Tyq7XJgG52"
75,2/ But what appealed to me immediately was the art of @Gossip_Goblin. It was quickly apparent that an artist has developed his own signature here. In the Discord I  learned that the Goblin Experiments are @Gossip_Goblin's work of the last 10 years! https://t.co/iuxjq7lmID
