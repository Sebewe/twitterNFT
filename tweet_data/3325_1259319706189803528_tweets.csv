1,@CryptoMoonRock @Bishop178 lol
2,"@CryptoMoonRock @Bishop178 dude you responded to my tweet about zach calling me a dick rider, with a bunch of lies. idk anything about the chardy situation, sounds bad. gl https://t.co/g3pM4qfKNG"
3,"@Bishop178 @CryptoMoonRock my advice would be you need to find evidence of funds moving, connect those to a wallet with known affiliation to chardy. that is difficult, but i wish you all the best. expose him"
4,"@Bishop178 @CryptoMoonRock dude im not saying anything is a coincidence, what do you guys want from me? make ur case - I literally have zero context here, what thread?"
5,"@CryptoMoonRock @timbotronic_ dude, by all means lay out all the evidence and call this dude out if he scammed. find something onchain to back it up, articulate what you think happened. i literally know nothing about this, havent heard about the project or person (chardy). make ur case, wish you all the best"
6,@CryptoMoonRock @timbotronic_ What does this tweet have to do with the rugged project?
7,@CryptoMoonRock @timbotronic_ So you are asking someone else to do the work? While accusing them of having bad ethics? Lol
8,@CryptoMoonRock @timbotronic_ You got the deleted tweet? On chain evidence of funds moving?
9,honored to be included in this! really excited to see what @Honest_NFT is working on https://t.co/6Jpvq8YqJ4

12,@Gems_Chill @SolidexFantom @AndreCronjeTech @JackNiewold @MIM_Spell @CurveFinance @GeistFinance @MultichainOrg @renprotocol @saddlefinance @_veDAO_ @iearnfinance why did solidex retweet this @JackNiewold @andrecronjedev are not the team LMAO
13,"almost 9k @_veDAO_ holders $weve, nuts"
14,@0xcarnation @soupdoteth efficient
15,@mustachedcrypt0 @amirgamble reeeeeee
16,@soupdoteth @0xcarnation simpdao but its just me funding carny to build
17,@0xcarnation carny....so sweet
18,"@amirgamble me getting tipsy at tip top and talking about cool stuff my friends are building, sometime in mid march"
19,@XMaxPowersX you should keep your eyes open for our next round of scouts applications (scouts is a contribute-to-join membership model for IT)
20,"@CopeRemindr @bobanetwork @InfoTokenDAO just to clarify, Information Token is advising Boba on tokenomics. I am not joining any team, and am not aware of any scams (though my dms are open ofc). 

Hoping our work can help give real utility to the Boba token"
21,"@33b345 @0xGekko @zachxbt as someone who believes strongly in the value of 50 something anons working together AND in leadership, my experience is that generalizing about ""DAOs"" is usually over simplistic (and wrong) whether its positive or negative"
22,@0xFTrail @cryptoboi88 @DuneAnalytics yooooo
23,@danhwang88 @zachxbt agreed 100%!
24,NFT trading joining the ranks of idk e-commerce shit in my youtube targeted ads is depressing
25,uh oh we aren't early anymore are we https://t.co/80sf3RLEdP
26,@Ace_da_Book no
27,@itsdanwu @Figue_me @nickbtts @0xkydo ty for sharing!
28,@sobylife ://
29,"@ann_droo we will have another round of applications opening up soon! would love to get you involved :) just a process, as it requires DAO approval"
30,"@ann_droo totally, i mean we have built in contributors w/o tokens into the core of the DAO already, this tweet is more bout me being used to my vision for IT being bigger than ppl understand :)"
31,@xnatasxswe @ListingSpy ty
32,"@itsdanwu how do you define metagovernance? i think @Figue_me is someone i talk to about this kind of stuff a lot, @nickbtts has a really sophisticated understanding of how to leverage governance processes for stable growth"
33,@sobylife doing really well how are you sweet soby
34,"@CryptoMoonRock @timbotronic_ i dont know about him, but if there is evidence of him doing bad shit im happy to help promote that"
35,"@CryptoMoonRock @timbotronic_ idk who tf chardy is, if zach had evidence of something he would post it is my opinion. no one is riding anyone's dick, im sorry you lost money on wonderland"
36,@ann_droo @pipe ty!!!!
37,"@CryptoMoonRock @timbotronic_ this is your evidence? so accusation, no evidence? fuck off https://t.co/OR4uJUbIY3"
38,@mdoteth right
39,@MichaelTant3 https://t.co/wgQ8uO0Cit
40,@ann_droo im such a n00b
41,@mdoteth so much of defi these days raise pre launch?
42,@douglassNFT would love to hear your perspective on how that changes things
43,does anybody raise capital after they are producing revenue? is that a thing?
44,@bankerkille only man who consistently is willing to put money behind his conviction
45,@CryptoMoonRock @timbotronic_ show evidence of this or fuck off imo
46,@CryptoMoonRock @timbotronic_ im in his network he didn't let me know
47,@timbotronic_ how can zach open a short position on an nft project?
48,@mhdempsey hiiiii
49,@zachxbt whoa ty for this resource will save me so many googles lol im such a dumbass
50,how much money did FWB raise?
51,"@Punk_2070 @zachxbt yea feels like its actually a bit low but im sure some people would be mad if i said higher, glad to clear up confusion haha"
52,"@Punk_2070 @zachxbt sorry that wasn't clear, my broad idea was start with 1m/year paid out monthly."
53,@Punk_2070 @zachxbt 1m a year kek
54,@33b345 @YeetPork @zachxbt exactly!!!
55,@zachxbt @33b345 btw i think @Honest_NFT is doing something you might both be interested
56,"@zachxbt @33b345 id argue the bigger issue for this with using a DAO structure is confidentiality. not sure exactly what a ""true"" dao is, DAOs come in many shapes and colors, and yes they all have inefficiencys and internal politics, and there are many that use dao as a buzzword."
57,@33b345 @zachxbt like all these ideas
58,"@33b345 @YeetPork @zachxbt this all makes sense, essentially a dao that funds people (including zach) to perform the work. 

I mean Information Token could set up a subDAO, we are certainly looking for different ways to build / invest with integrity"
59,"@zachxbt @LordBogdanoff 100%, in my mind you have earned trust through actions (and worked hard for it) and so I do have a baseline amount of trust for you that I do not for other scam-exposing accounts. think funding your work as a public good would be a benefit to all"
60,"@timbotronic_ first of all, this isn't true (how could one short pixelmons?) second of all, my point is if we funded this as a public good it could help protect against accusations like this (just my take)"
61,@p0lynice @zachxbt will do! dont want to do anything @zachxbt isn't interested in but more than happy to help if this makes sense.
62,if we are giving scams $70m we should be giving the people who expose them  more than we are currently
63,"would also enable zach not to trade, invest in projects, or otherwise put in danger his status as an impartial figure. not sure if he is even interested in this just my thoughts"
64,"imo 1m of funding paid out in monthly installments seems like a good baseline for zach to continue doing the work he is doing, would provide enough capital to pay for legal fees (i imagine some scammer will eventually bring legal action against him just for the nuisance)"
65,imo the work @zachxbt is doing is a public good and should be funded as such by the space broadly. would be happy to coordinate more than an informal fundraiser (tho by all means send money to zach's ens: zachxbt.eth) https://t.co/Nsc8XYJvAQ
66,"@soupdoteth im quite attached to the OG aesthetic of the tokens, im sure IT will incubate other NFT projects in the future though"
67,@podclipsapp @maxnorris__ imagine it has farther to fall but ill be watching
68,"RT @InfoTokenDAO: We are happy to announce we are joining the @bobanetwork as official advisors!

We're looking forward to helping continue…"
69,@safetyth1rd @etherscan my favorite protocol that isn't a protocol
70,@Woji_Crypto @FladdyBird1 @lord_proto right smart
71,@Woji_Crypto @FladdyBird1 @lord_proto great please make sure to include the private key information ty
72,@Woji_Crypto @FladdyBird1 @lord_proto sure dm wallet
73,"@Cryptoyieldinfo $HND good token, good project"
74,"@0xWolff i do! rarely love a pfp but big fan of @0xngmi, @ratwell0x and the tubbys themselves :)"
75,@0xyucko @tubbycatsnft ah cool! where can you do that
76,@0xyucko @tubbycatsnft i like both a lot but I own 1 tubby and no wassie (not sure why really) so i vote tubby
77,@Rager right makes sense
78,@MBaskitch @basedkarbon very cool man
79,@FladdyBird1 @lord_proto sure dm wallet
80,"@bitcoinPalmer stay tuned, might be some updates this week that should accomplish that :)"
81,@jpw_dev got mine listed for 25 eth but honestly should delist i love that messy lil tubby
82,@lord_proto 80 eth
83,@KirbyLarp damn kirby how can you can tell im already thinking about how to get IT to 100m+
84,"@bitcoinPalmer i personally dont give a shit about stuff written in another protocols marketing materials, especially given I know it wasn't true. beef feels pretty much squashed at this point - both sides lashed out, both sides just want to drive value to our communities now."
85,"@bitcoinPalmer agree :), we are definitely distinct protocols with different value props but have been chatting with the team a bunch this past week, so stay tuned"
86,"@CryptoUnic team has been really open to our ideas thus far, think its a big opportunity to help align long term incentives for users to grow adoption and really give $boba utility...keep an eye out for updates!"
87,every single time this legend (one the first mfers i followed and felt like i could trust on here) mentions $weve i smile https://t.co/Z1TruUUef2
88,i love the tubbys
89,people have been telling me Information Tokens are too expensive since they were .5 eth
90,"@tr1cexbt @bitcoinPalmer ty man, really appreciate that. my take is that if we are going to really scale up this space we need DAOs that give anons with a rare, specific skill set the opportunity to earn by working with new/established projects. 

also doing venture stuff, incubating projects, &amp; research"
91,@maxnorris__ squiggle's floor is 7.5 eth? god damn
92,@alanchiu @InfoTokenDAO so excited to work with you all!
93,"@tr1cexbt @bitcoinPalmer a bunch were free then it was like .05 and slowly moved up, highest i sold during mint was 2.5 eth i believe"
94,"@bitcoinPalmer happy to info pill you anytime ser, lets have a call"
