if you integrate $DAI into your protocol i will personally yeet a few grand and will shill to the maker and ethereum communities

32,crypto payments and financial services can benefit underserved groups precisely because they are irreversible and function similarly to cash
33,"banks face asymmetric downside risk from serving many low income/low asset clients due to these charge back risks

lack of access pushes people to predatory non-bank financial services like check cashing stores and high cost prepaid debit cards"
34,"reg E allows for reversal of unauthorized payments that are reported within 60 days of receiving statement (basically up to 90 days chargeback period)

so banks are extending credit and taking risk exposure for any electronic payment"
35,"newsflash for the bleeding heart liberals who think crypto can never work because there's no way to reverse fraud or theft

reg E and other electronic payment ""consumer protection"" measures are the primary driver of underbanking in the US

how is this? https://t.co/qx4f22tgPd"
36,@ncweaver 100% chargebacks can be useful in preventing loss. but payments being reversible (90+ days in many cases) means even a cash account involves credit risk exposure. reg E and all the other undo mechanisms are a big driver of underbanking
37,"@colo_lee remain open minded. ""consumer protection"" measures are the number 1 driver of financial exclusion in the US
https://t.co/OYNXRBWLRB"
38,"@ncweaver banks will not open a checking account for people with bad credit. this is 100% due to the consumer protection measures applied to electronic payments. you can argue benefits outweigh the costs, but its not clear cut as you seem to suggest"
39,"@ncweaver you hold up reversibility of trad payment instruments as a benefit, but i dont think you understand the negative externalities this causes for users

this means any financial service involves an extension of credit and risk exposure, which increases financial exclusion"
40,@ncweaver i view power consumption mostly as a non sequitur - proof of work is the past and present of crypto but not the future
41,@ncweaver confirmation bias. you dont seem open to info that conflicts with your existing worldview

68,"@ChamathsIntern yeah, although i think the details of how it works will be different - from my understanding it will be more like renting, where chains pay inflation rewards to atom stakers rather than needing to buy/borrow a bunch of atoms themselves to secure a ""slot"""
69,"@ChamathsIntern agree and i think most ibc projects will move to shared security, although maybe atom will be better for this?"
70,@ChamathsIntern ppl still see L1-ness as an asset rather than liability/cost
71,@mikedemarais I think just part of a general growth -&gt; value rotation. Also financials tend to benefit from higher central bank rates (higher net interest margin)
72,@safetyth1rd i dont think any fixed term products have found PMF in defi yet. the cost to roll over positions is just too high on L1

84,"pretty cool imo

rocket pool can reduce the cost of bootstrapping rETH liquidity by working alongside lido stETH

with stETH currently earning 4.4% apy and making up 50% of proposed pool, this is equivalent to 2.2% apy liquidity mining subsidy (vs pairing with ETH) https://t.co/F0XFF0Nr2X"
85,"@SAnthonyH @ASvanevik @LidoFinance disclosure: have ldo bags

rocketpool is great, but has pretty significant scalability issues

lido steth is able to compete with custodial staking providers (kraken, coinbase, etc) which i think is a big benefit for decentralization even if rpl is a more ""pure"" approach"
