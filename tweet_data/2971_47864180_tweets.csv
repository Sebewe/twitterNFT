79,"Yes. Moreover,creativity is triggered only when mind is off.  Freedom from mind is creativity, flow,bliss, love and beauty. Mind is hypnosis. Creative thinking differs from mind.  Breath, observe, build, create, than step out and let the whole do its thing. https://t.co/N54w1XdKSv"
80,"@NiftyReport Thai is the  only strategy protecting from  the mind: it will jump from a thought to the next, will trick from one asset to the “better.” An endless race for just one more. It’s  nature of the mind. Will always lose to flow, nature, and conviction."
