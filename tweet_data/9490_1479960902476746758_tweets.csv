13,@xBenJamminx @Syberer They used the funds to buy BAYC mayc and azuki 💀 400 eth
14,@LeooNFTs @thebrettway @Syberer First they said it was the devs but then they said that the team (syber) themselves bought the NFTs. If they were real devs or a real team they’d spend it on fixing the project. Not buying BAYC mayc and azukis
15,@OttoSuwenNFT Markets just living off pixelmon memes right now 😂
16,@TheNFTChief Success you say https://t.co/dtRTM7dYM7
17,@LeooNFTs @thebrettway @Syberer They literally said it’s ‘to pay devs’ but then turned around and said they decided to use funds to buy blue chip NFTs. Why buy another project when yours looks like this. This project is definitely ran by a 14 year old.. https://t.co/Ktsp3yYK2I

31,"@Syberer @Pixelmon It’s funny how team took out 400 eth then tried to say they used that to pay devs. Eventually they said they decided to buy blue chips NFTs because the market was down. (BAYC, Mayc, azuki) Imagine making that decision when your project has gone to shit without telling community"
