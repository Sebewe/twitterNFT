46,@doodles nft event of the year 👀
47,@hodl_a_bit @doodles Yep that's reasonable but I like that the team is so focused on the core collection for now. Once you dilute there's no going back. These wrapped experiences are a good way to product test for the time being.

55,"@Degentraland @doodles Yea I think the economics behind renting are even more bullish for non dilutive projects, thanks!"
56,(12) hi bae's mom
57,"(11) We have so much to look forward to holding Doodles, but for now let's focus on the technical and creative masterpiece that is Space Doodles. Amazing displays of art, animation, and sound await. I will see you all in space!"
58,"(10) Although I believe a lot of the examples given are a ways away, Space Doodles marks the beginning. Many collections will copy Doodles as many collections copied BAYC for their companion drop. But the Doodles will have revolutionized it."
59,"(9) If I decide I don't want to go to the private Kanye x Doodles concert, I can rent my Doodle for the perceived value of that event. Or if I decide I need a brake from NFTs I rent my Doodle for the summer. Due to the non dilutive nature of our core PFP, rent will increase."
60,"(8) ""Well hold on a minute. If I never receive any airdrops, how can I profit from my doodle without selling?"" As this space progresses it will be common to rent NFTs for either specific experiences as discussed above or just in general for specified timeframes."
61,(7) Okay one final example for fun: Kanye West finally adopts NFTs and realizes he loves the Doodles. The next wrapped experience: each doodle dancing to a random track from Donda 2. This new wrapped NFT also acts as your ticket to se Ye in concert. The possibilities are endless.
62,"(6) These opportunities extend beyond fashion. Imagine gaming assets. Instead of receiving a playable avatar NFT airdrop that is compatible with some metaverse game, Doodles could wrap their NFTs and this new NFT would be playable. When they are done playing, they can unwrap."
63,"(5b) In a Doodles x Adidas partnership, Doodle holders could wrap their PFPs to show a branded experience: each Doodle wearing Adidas gear. This wrapped NFT could then give holders access to exclusive Adidas merchandise."
64,(5a) New revenue streams. Doodles can sell these experiences as partnerships with major brands. Let's look at the BAYC x Adidas partnership. BAYC holders were able to mint separate Adidas NFTs that granted them exclusive merchandise.
65,(4) We still don't know the lore behind Doodles. These experiences via wrapped Doodles enable a much more profound storytelling experience. Think of it like episodes in a television show where our PFPs are along for the ride.
66,(3) The ability to wrap our NFTs allows Doodles as a brand to respond to new cultural trends and consumer interests without diluting the original collection. This gives the Doodle team constant flexibility to test what the market wants.
67,"(2) First, as @Degentraland so kindly pointed out to us variable PFPs capture identity better than static PFPs. Our PFPs are a digital extension of our true identity. However, identity is often fluid and evolving and our moods are constantly changing. We need PFPs that can adapt."
68,"(1) Many people yet to understand the true implications of wrapped NFTs look at space doodles as a fun new animation. In reality, this marks a fundamental shift in how we will view PFPs and Web3 brands"
69,"Space Doodles is just around the corner and I want to remind everyone why I am so incredibly bullish  🧵👇

78,@HumanGenius_io @0xMuZ @dagg3rhigh the amount of confusion this has led to haha. yea the hat is USSR and labeled “commie”
79,@NFTsAreNice LMAO
80,"@dagg3rhigh What is my argument? I'm just saying there is a USSR hat named ""commie hat"" that probably isn't ideal for use as a PFP right now."
81,"@zachluna5 I know that? The trait is called ""Commie Hats"""
82,@dagg3rhigh the trait name is “commie”
83,@austin_hurwitz love you my dood
84,@Degentraland @doodles I agree with every critique you brought up about them but their differentiator is creating a marketplace ecosystem for 3d builders to run their own businesses. No other pfp project is empowering this type of behavior so far. Let’s see if they can create networks effects around it
85,@Degentraland @doodles Happy you reevaluated your stance on clones 🤙🏻
