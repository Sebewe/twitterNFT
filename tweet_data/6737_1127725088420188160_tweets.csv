22,5/ We believe for those reasons this bar of gold will double if not triple in the coming weeks
23,"4/ The situation in Europe already seems to be getting out of control. Gun sales are at record levels. People are arming themselves as protection. If the outlook remains more or less the same, people might shift some of their portfolios toward gold and other precious metals."
24,"3/ 1970s saw many upheavals, including the Iranian Revolution in 1978, the Iran-Iraq war in 1979, the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, and the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979. Gold prices rose 23% in 1977, 37% in 1978, and an incredible 126% in 1979."
25,"2/ Not only are other asset prices affected immediately in the event of war or even the threat of it, but wars also mean excessive money printing and accelerated government spending."
26,1/ Gold’s safe haven appeal might lead investors to gold and other precious metals in terms of heightened geopolitical tensions and war.
