81,"@C0rnh0li0 @0xSchatz @0xWodan @LeonidasNFT @mattmedved He owns the expired one and early owns the renewed one. What the true nft is, is up for debate but I love the narrative that has formed around this esp with the fitting name ""Quantum"" lol

88,@0xWodan @0xSchatz @LeonidasNFT @mattmedved This is the most interesting thing I read all week. Does he or one single entity still own all 5470 entries? By owning one you'd LITERALLY own a piece of the image. Id buy a few.

91,"@RutraZemog @0xSchatz @LeonidasNFT @mattmedved Pls read through my tweets again, I don't care how they're stored. What bugs me is that there are always several imgs linked to an identity and we just chose the one that fits our artificially created 2021 narrative. Today we intentionally tokenize imgs which is the main diff tho"
92,"@0xSchatz @RutraZemog @LeonidasNFT @mattmedved My point is that they're falsely advertised as ""nft projects"" when they're just expired identities. If they'd be sold as what they are it'd be super weird but I'd be ok with it then. Selling/Advting smthg as an egg, cause a identitiy includes a link to one is just deceiving imo"
93,@RutraZemog @0xSchatz @LeonidasNFT @mattmedved I didn't fully do my research. It was later I found out that I actually bought an expired namecoin identity. All Im trying to do is spread the truth about OneName identities cause this is often left out from what I see in the discord. everything I stated is true and truth /= fud
94,"@RutraZemog @0xSchatz @LeonidasNFT @mattmedved If this is what makes things more interesting for you I cant help but offer my old myspace acc for sale in case some of you egg heads are intereste. with emblem vaults this actually would work haha

95,"@0xSchatz @LeonidasNFT @mattmedved Two AWS links, one leads to a purple egg and the other to a pic of the OG name owner surfing on the beach. Somehow I sold his identity for 6figs but this is far away from a nft project."
96,"@0xSchatz @LeonidasNFT @mattmedved Yes they intentionally created a OneName identity which automatically put all of the users info (account name, twitter name, twitter profile and cover pic) on namecoin. This is from the egg I once owned. https://t.co/S6oqqhPTEY"
97,"@0xSchatz @LeonidasNFT @mattmedved Eggs, Blockheads, Identicons and Mangas are not NFT projects - they ended up on namecoin by accident because people registered OneName accounts and linked their social media accs to it. Quantum is the only intentionally created PROJECT on namecoin afaik but there may be more"
98,@0xRay291 @GregRementer @LeonidasNFT @mattmedved @Eggs_Namecoin backstory? That they accidentally ended up on namecoin by people registering a OneName account and linking their twitter? and that all of them expired and got renewed by an unknown group of ppl about a year ago? So hiStOriCaLly siGniFicaNT
