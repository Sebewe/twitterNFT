85,@0xP4X @NFTbark Yeah this is an interesting one. In the traditional world there would be lawsuits coming from every direction.
86,"@Loopifyyy @jeffalomaniac Agreements are made so it is crystal clear where you stand. Good or bad. It's been agreed upon and that is what needs to be enforced. 

If both parties are open to discussing something else then that is different, but not up to only one party to want to force changes."
87,"@NFTbark Might not be able to make it tomorrow morning so curious to hear your take on it. 

Mine is that just because this is a new space, it doesn't mean we can break laws and do whatever we want. I also disagree how OS is acting. They also need to be liable for damages."

2) we all need to stop buying into these projects. But many still do because they know they can flip these overhyped projects."
99,@greatmando_nft Yep. And they should be held accountable.
