1,And that's my story of how easy it is to burn money because of FOMO. Feel free to learn from my mistake. Bye for now. https://t.co/4l1lGVP3vF
2,"Had I just been more patient - registered the FOMO as a sign not to enter - done some more research, at the very least I wouldn't be down so bad (I bought basically the top). https://t.co/Dp8K3ufhdJ"
3,"Returning to my thesis for a second, I don't think my reasoning was terrible, but I made it SO much harder for me to be right because of my late and expensive entry. This also made it harder to exit because I was immediately underwater. https://t.co/d8NvZSJrlu"
4,Hopefully now you see why everyone posting their Ws on Twitter is just one disproportionate side of the story. Not everyone can win - we can't all make it. https://t.co/jVE9GDqJWi
5,"Here's another takeaway, you have to own your Ls like you own your Ws. You won't get anywhere in life blaming others for your decisions. See: https://t.co/2Ffef8Xc1Z https://t.co/QpoDXOE5Nj"
6,"So in all likelihood, I am going to sell my @CryptoBatzNFT to realise the capital loss because I have no real clue whether it will appreciate or not. It's painful, but I am fully responsible. There's no one else to blame here but me (well, maybe @GDolois 😆). https://t.co/8naZEDKukS"
7,"The amount of confidence/conviction I have is directly proportional to the amount of research I have done. As a result, I have small list of high conviction assets:

Crypto:
$BTC
$ETH
$FLOW

NFTs:
@PurrnelopesCC 

This is my list, don't copy me - make your own! https://t.co/FpLJYss8uw"
8,"As investors, we are blessed with having the time to research something to death, then make bets in line with our conviction and risk management. We can swap out doubt for confidence. https://t.co/l3DPScD9np"
9,"Markets, NFTs - the world - is an endless stream of opportunities, so why put money into anything unless you have serious conviction? https://t.co/GBt5j2Uggg"
10,"A good rule of thumb is if you have ANY doubts or are experiencing FOMO, do nothing, fold. Why invest a cent if you are not SURE it's a good decision? https://t.co/1ZWftq4p8z"
11,"FOMO = BURNING MONEY. The amount of capital lost - in all markets - because of this mental state is incalculable. It's a cliché, but it keeps happening because it's human nature. https://t.co/VBVqXabtnD"
12,My point here isn't to FUD @CryptoBatzNFT - I have no strong opinion on this project.  What I want readers to take from this is the following.… https://t.co/bpnRieA4c9
13,"At the time of writing, the @CryptoBatzNFT floor is .275 ETH and I expect I could get about .35 ETH (~$1000) for my bat. https://t.co/Cd1hKn1MfQ"
14,"This might seem like a minor issue, but has no doubt caused some confusion - people buying up bats at what they considered to be a discount, only to realise the bat's primary use case has been exhausted. https://t.co/vQ2Jfrkb0d"
15,"Fast forward a few weeks, and there's little demand for MutantBatz and there has been one key oversight - OS listings do not inform you whether a bat has been used (bitten) or not. https://t.co/7vJ7GZlNeg"
16,"My very flimsy thesis was this: the partnerships are great and have a huge market cap combined, so if there's demand and it's well executed, only a relatively small amount of that capital needs to trickle down for it to be +EV, or so I thought. https://t.co/u5dPyuFtOZ"
17,"I don't ordinarily FOMO into stuff like this, but at that moment the hysteria got the better of me. What really reeled me in was the frantic scramble by people on OS to pick one up, the first time I had witnessed this... https://t.co/CAveYc8hM4"
18,"Despite the late entry, I thought there would be still be some value even though they were trading at 27x the mint price... https://t.co/leEZAofwVx"
19,"This is a short story about hype, humility and FOMO, by Nacho. 🧵

On 19/2/22, I bought a recently minted @CryptoBatzNFT for 2.2 ETH (~$6,800 w/gas). https://t.co/ivRbiGXOXi"
20,"If I was to add, I'd want:

Black Knight: 2/47 listed, 5 ETH floor.  
Gold Knight: 3/50 Listed, 2.25 ETH floor. 
Tiara: 1/49 listed, 2.75 ETH floor. 
Beanie: 3/50 listed, 1.5 ETH floor. 

Damn, there are so few premiums listed (no silver knights). 🤔 https://t.co/z9UZYbr326"

27,@SmokinLou914 Unbeatable partnership 🤝
28,"@Mooofie2 Thank you. Some were good value, a lot of snipes from the pool, some not so much (the knight was pricey). Of course, my cost basis would be a lot lower had I just just minted 70 but then I wouldn't have this collection."
29,"@AdamSmurfy @PurrnelopesCC Thank you, ser. I appreciate that."
30,@Mooofie2 I love the heart glasses and helm combo. That is 🔥
31,"@Mooofie2 Well played, sir. Well played."
32,@SmokinLou914 My favorite cat (more so than my PFP which I minted). There isn't a more 'boss' cat than this one... https://t.co/WxHxUNMOSU
33,"I might add 1 or 2 more, but I wanted to have a nice range of cats and I think I have achieved that."

36,"Excellent point, @900537H . A kitten (current floor, 0.042) grants you access to @PurrnelopesCC and will yield one $TOKEN per day when it launches. They also happen to be awesome: https://t.co/lryEttTmGm https://t.co/HPLZvzJxFC"

38,"@TheShillPCC Is the Tesla going to appreciate in value, ever?"
39,@0xQuit @CryptoBatzNFT @PurrnelopesCC 💯😅 Easy to remedy at least.
40,"@hodl_pcc @CryptoBatzNFT @PurrnelopesCC Yeah, I am inclined to agree. However, I do think not being able to identify bats that have already bitten easily on OS is a pretty poor oversight. I think that is in part why the floor is what it is."

47,@AdamSmurfy @TheShillPCC Not at all. On the contrary I see this a positive.
48,"@PurrnelopesCC is really just a game of patience to me, and I think a lot of people have been tested. If you're still here, congrats. The party hasn't really started yet."
49,"@LeTopshot @PurrnelopesCC The fact that Purrs has been building for this long while also being relatively stable (in ETH terms) makes it something of anomaly to me, in a bullish way. Purrs hasn't really been in the spotlight. We'll get some serious traction on delivery of the many great things coming."
50,"@LeTopshot @PurrnelopesCC Yeah I think the NFT space is largely obsessed with WL/raffles, and has a very short attention span. No one is thinking 'Let me find a project that launched 7 months ago to ape into'."
51,"@TheShillPCC Good point, and I think we'll see a lot of consolidation/clarification in the Roadmap 2.0 as well come nice surprises no doubt."
52,"Personally, I'm fine with the speed at which things are progressing. If anything, it gives me more time to evaluate, to research, to have conviction. I think we'll see a lot of things unfold together: 'Gradually, then suddenly'."
53,"Let's go again (not picking on you Wgmi, these are good points). It's true, we haven't seen the airdrops come to fruition yet, but Rome wasn't built in a day and the ambition here is frankly unrivalled. https://t.co/4POa6F1FY2"
54,"@TheShillPCC @PurrnelopesCC I think its something you can level at a lot of projects, particularly in their infancy."
55,*flaws 🤦‍♂️😄
56,We can't address criticisms/floors if we ignore them. I welcome that and its necessary to remain balanced.

66,"4) Community. We have an awesome community at @PurrnelopesCC. To see why this is not just a platitude, go have a look. Some projects are huge because of their community alone. Purrs has community and substance. 

https://t.co/TmxzTfHgr0"
67,"3) Ambition: This team wants to build something we have never seen before and maximise the utility of NFTs way beyond just your average PFP project. The artwork (which I love, how can you not) is just the tip of the iceberg. https://t.co/iafMO77kBu"
68,"2) Credibility: Look at the make up of the team and how they are delivering. Slow and steady, built to last and within the law. This is a team of builders. 🧱

https://t.co/25BgiB6GEu"
69,"1) Innovation: A lot of the things they've built (and are building) are novel. See the Kitty Vault, sub domains, the airdrops and watch closely what they do with $TOKEN. This is just what we know so far. 🧐 1/4 🧵

73,@TheShillPCC @PurrnelopesCC 😻
74,@Carlini8N Consider using some $TOKEN as a prize for a team based tournament with free entry to various other NFT projects (send out invites asking them to form a team). Tokens to be distributed to winners irrespective of their involvement with Purrs. This could drive engagement/exposure.
75,@MilburyNft @tzh90 @Carlini8N I think some version of this combined with a means of rewarding active community members who maybe aren't the top hodlers/or been in from the beginning. Perhaps a % could be held back for a community vote on how said % could be distributed.

1. Be early or wait/skip
2. Use exit liquidity when its there
3. Take profit, move on
