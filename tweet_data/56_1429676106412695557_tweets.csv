0,@YoungDaG23 @EthernalElves it costs like $10 to put 10 elves on L2 for me then 0 gas fees after that
1,@garyvee ❤️
2,"@TheSaintOfSpain @EthernalElves spend prob 10 mins a day, holding 10 elves"
3,@rarestpokemon @EthernalElves 10-15mins
4,@YoungDaG23 @EthernalElves huh? with ethernal elves you pay 0 gas haha
5,"I fell this could be avoided if we just did more research and taught others around us how to do so as well. Without centralization all the weight is put upon the users, and if we want a true Web 3 environment than we need to become more wise to what goes https://t.co/knsGSKunUN"
6,@NFTLlama ehhh 4/10 kinda cute but you missed a spot
7,"@bcarrasqui @cartoonsnft may see a pump after public sale, this market is kinda choppy right now so I wouldnt be entering trades like that tbh, just my trading style"
8,"@Mr_NeverWright @EthernalElves @bloodshedbears its layer 2 so the gas fees are almost nothing, because of that the devs just pay all the gas, so you never spend a penny"
9,@HaukeaAloha @EthernalElves yeah you just sell the token
10,"@Schliegs @EthernalElves Yes, I encourage you to join the discord and ask around. the game is a tad complex for most new users, I recommend starting with at least 2-3 elves if possible"
11,"There is 0 interaction with metamask after you're elves are bridged to Layer 2, making gameplay smooth and seamless! Eternal elves were modeled after Ether Orcs which currently sit over 3eth. all I can say is dont be surprised if EE Goes on a similar run but please DYOR ♥️"
12,"I called out eternal elves shortly after their launch, their dev team is top notch and just implemented Layer 2 gameplay on polygon!
Not only are all gas fees paid by the devs! But you dont even realize you are playing a blockchain game."
13,Ren will be used to mint Elders which will become the genesis collection! With well over 6 months of mints planned there is always something new to look forward to! My current strategy is to continue and stack up $REN and prepare for elders as they will be the most valuable
14,"(only about 200 elves left), You can also use $REN to find new weapons and items. There are many more use cases for $REN in the future but I am overwhelmingly bullish on this game, not only because of how much passive income I'm making but also what the dev team has planned!"
15,"Either by passive staking or active gameplay by sending your elf out on different game modes. If you are passive staking or actively playing you will earn their currency called $REN, this is the token that is used in all aspects of the game, you can mint more elves with $REN"
16,"Why im so bullish and how I am making $200-250 a day playing @EthernalElves!

There are 3 classes for the elves, Druids, Rangers and Assassins! I have a total of 10 elves, You can choose how you play the game. 👇"

46,If you trust a team and know they will continue to innovate and provide what they promised then it may be a good idea to look for a nice dip and stock up on as much of their project as you can. Betting on people and teams is pretty easy to do and much more effective

Very interesting project that has a paint to earn tokenomics system!

66,After seeing @FarmsOfGalileo and @WGMInterfaces cancel their projects today due to fear of under delivering I think we may see more projects do this in the future. Sad to see them cancel but it’s better than a project slowly dying due to not being able to fulfill a promise
67,"There is nothing wrong with taking value from those that provide it for you, after all most of them are providing it for you to take! But at the end of the day you will always make more from giving than taking :) a healthy balance is required ♥️"
68,"because of that they try to take the most amount of value from other people. If you notice most successful people in the NFT space all focus on providing value to others, there is a reason for that.  👇"
69,"#NFT Tip of the day!

Adding value:

This isnt so much an NFT specific tip but more so a generalized tip for life!

Providing value to others will bring you more value than taking value from others.

A lot of people want to receive the most value they can. 👇"
