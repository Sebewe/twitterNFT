6,The fact I see this on my feed in 2022 is really sad. We are all equal. Skin colour should never be a factor.. https://t.co/oH5wYInxRs

8,"A quick reminder is that we’ll see holder counts drop for doodles. Not because people are selling, but people will be taking their doodle to space. Overall leaving less Doodles on the market. What will this do to FP? Don’t know, but I’m sure as hell looking forward to it.#doodles"
9,SpaceDoodles are releasing tomorrow. This isn’t just about another airdrop or event. This is innovative technology being showcased. I believe SpaceDoodles will change NFTs for the better and we’re gonna see many projects use wrapping as a form to build experiences with their art.

68,@ericpantherlee @SenshiNFT Checkout @monkelabs they are a launchpad for sol projects and do all the background checks for investors. I believe they also dox them.

89,Things like this make me laugh so much. How many times have we seen a project justify their price and value because they are offering ‘utility’ with ‘p2e’ or ‘staking’. It’s too oversaturated. https://t.co/ldSFFK82L7
