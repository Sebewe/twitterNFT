1,"@BluebirdX11 It's funny when #nft people get all serious.

We are a joke. That's what makes us valuable. Sartoshi #mfers are a joke and a copy of cryptopunks. It's a sh*t project that somehow caught on. Let's not make believe there's Value here. We're having fun. That's all."

Is there a book or articles that explain all this kinda stuff?

There's an information gap here. People like me want to learn but no technical resources.

7,@jameslavish @saifedean @JeffBooth Any good books that explain why it's important to run your own node. Been a bitcoiner for a few years but I still don't get the whole run your own node thing. Why is that important?

40,@TheBitfi Pay the dude that hacked Bitfi last time and see if he could do it again. Rashid was his name I think.
41,"Why do I not care about the #Bitcoin Price? 

Because the amount of Bitcoin I own doesn't change based on its relative value to toilet paper money. I'm much more excited when I manage to stack some more #sats. Then my #Bitcoin goes up."
42,@DevinFidler @AriZonanHODL I'm going to send your message to the #Bitcoin CEO and Board Of Directors. Perhaps they should change their marketing campaign. It will be discussed at the next board meeting. Thank you for your submission.
43,"I am getting my 1/1 #Thingdoms.

Just want to put that out there.

It's happening.

It's just a matter of time.

I can't be a ThingdomsMaxi without it.

If you are a 1/1 owner hold on tight. I'm coming for you.

#Thingdoms"
44,"@TheBitfi It's really a shame. You have such a great product. If only you'd expand to NFTs and add tokens...

Would also help to go through the same testing Ledger has gone through. We all know ledgers weaknesses but you guys were exposed and you never really proved that things improved."

53,@theREEALtj @InvsbleFriends True. I'm a little cracked. Can't you tell from my #pfp? @InvsbleFriends seems to be the real deal after all. Maybe you guys should grab #thingdoms as well. Good vibes.

60,"You have a choice...

You vibe with an #NFT in a collection but it is less rare than the one you have.

Do you offer a swap or #Hodl the more rare one. 

Rank 1k/5k (the one I have) vs. 3k/5k (the one I vibe with)

65,"I spent $25k on a walking #jpeg.

Can't get on to discord. Zero Twitter followers as a result of owning @InvsbleFriends.

Wondering out loud if their Twitter followers are all bots/no real community. 

At this point just holding for FOMO. My guess is 1 eth floor incoming.

66,"@lukeabc @NFTHawks Guilty as charged...

Fortunately I'm also an investor. Projects like #thingdoms will save me from my invisible tendencies 😉"
67,@InvsbleFriends Is there a list of 1/1s?
68,@addyo_ I've learned that holding is almost always the best way to succeed.
69,@addyo_ I'm actually not sure. This can go to zero. I invested. Now I wait.
70,@addyo_ Patience
71,@InvsbleFriends You guys should have made this an nft that could have been have convertible into a real hat

87,"What will happen after reveal?

#InvisibleFriends"
88,I get why @RNDMCHARACTERS &amp; @InvsbleFriends shut down their discord but shouldn't it be open to the 5000 of us that own an #InvisibleFriends? I should be able to get in after verifying. I think paying $25k earns me a spot.
