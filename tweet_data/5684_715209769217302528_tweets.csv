2,"@Gee__Gazza And when you interact with Ether on the Ethereum chain, you are Ethering"
3,"Instead of giving your holders priority to mint your new NFT collection, explain the network effect of community expansion. Give non-holders a chance to join and enhance the community. Diverse and open-minded communities in decentralized environments 🌐👋💛"
4,@CryptoAnglio Are you sure you want something fungible?
5,"You can say what you want, but the #UkraineRussia situation kicked off so many real-life use cases for #Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies."
6,RT @nayibbukele: The intrinsic value of #Bitcoin is now in full display on the whole world.
7,@Nick_Alex_1 @CryptoMories @iwwon_official Wen floor 😂
8,It is the right decision to not freeze (innocent) Russian user accounts on crypto exchanges #Binance - Thank you from the industry 💛
9,@camilacampton Oh for me it's the opposite 😂
10,"101 mates on Twitter - I just started my journey of sharing and educating people funnily and smartly to make Twitter even more valuable for NFT &amp; Crypto traders, holders, starters, and pros. Thank you all 🙏 - Hold tight, we just started 🚀"
11,@PuffYatty None
12,@TheCryptoDog So you are bearish?
13,@DiscoverXnft Oh no… blowing up https://t.co/Lhjm0mJZhp
14,"@ohhshiny Yup, your ego should be set aside in most of the cases"
15,"Investing in #NFTs is like Angel investing. Likely 9 out of 10 will fail, but this 1 out of 10 will give you the returns to invest more. #NFTGame #investing"
16,"You can leave #web3, but #web3 won’t leave you…"
17,#Bitcoin HIGH -&gt; Twitter activity HIGH
18,WAGMI ☀️ #Bitcoin
19,Nobody is talking about a weak $dollar or yearly inflation anymore. The multiplier of it is happening in a week in Russia.
20,@DiscoverXnft Is this pre-reveal? 😹
21,Imagine a stablecoin for the ruble. How do you keep that stable? 📉
22,"@hdl_eth Dude, this domain should not be sold ever -&gt; hodl"

24,@ElectionDayMad1 @BoredApeYC After 3 seconds I was bored…
25,"How do you want your Discord, sir? #NFTCommunity ⬇️⬇️"
26,@ryancarson That's why you should always buy 2 😆
27,Sometimes it is way more fun to just watch a mint and reveal of an #NFTCollection happen. Floor prices always goes up and down - Like everything else in the world.
28,Proof: https://t.co/gh8ewySxyv
29,"I have a @cryptocom Visa Card, and back in November 2020, I paid for my Spotify and Netflix monthly with my card. I got a 100% rebate which was around 158 CRO each month. Currently, 1 CRO is worth 0.40 USD. This means that back then, I got refunded 60-70 USD each month 💸 #crypto"
30,"@ryancarson Man, and so good when being in the NFT world 😂 Drifting off a little…"
31,"Always buy min. 2 items of a collection if you can; this allows you to sell 1 at ATH but still hold 1 item to be part of the community/long-term #NFTGame. 

I wish I had done this more often...

#NFTCommunity"
32,@tmagled @coolcatsnft @NftTrader Nice - You got some followers? 😂
33,"Hold your NFTs like you hold your girl- and boyfriends, but longer"

35,@NathanHeadPhoto Was it WL only or also public mint?
36,Feature request for OS: Not receive emails about bids below X% of the floor price. Thank you! #OpenSeaNFT
37,"@Bastienjpg I know, I know... Let's not overthink it"
38,"@FedorovMykhailo I understand your situation, but this ain’t the same as SWIFT that is controlled by large organizations. I am afraid this goes against many innocent Russian citizens trying to hedge against the massive value drop of the national currency."
39,"@WatcherGuru It’s the same scenario as in Canada, ain’t gonna happen… And it also makes sense, because that misses the purpose of crypto"
40,One of the favorites of my holdings. @BlackSheepSCNFT #NFT #NFTs #NFTdrop #NFTCollection https://t.co/LD3A4fsshC

44,@DiscoverXnft All the way down 📉
45,@InvsbleFriends I can’t see mine @InvsbleFriends
46,"@DiscoverXnft You are very confident about the price drop, huh? 😂"
47,@chriscantino From consuming to deciding
48,My prediction is that a big % of new NFT users in 2022 will come from workers in tech companies. That just makes sense.
49,@jaimeschmidt Oh yeah. https://t.co/DZJw3rInaO
50,My girlfriend just asked me: Which NFT did you buy today? I answered: You tell me. Which one do you like more?
51,"@saraledterman I was expecting comments like #Bitcoin solves this, but #Bitcoin and #web3 solves this."
52,@WatcherGuru Sorry for all these word jokes - They had to be done
53,@WatcherGuru That stocks...
54,@WatcherGuru I hope they have more websites in stock
55,@WatcherGuru The website got stocked up on
56,@jbondwagon Web4 https://t.co/J2aJQtCz8r
57,I really hope that all the NFT and crypto donation accounts and collections of Ukraine aren’t rugs 😃
58,"@saylor Bit now, bit later."
59,"@DiscoverXnft I heard it’s an invisible reveal, you can’t actually see what you bought. Anyways, it’s better to sell"
60,"1/4 of all tweets on my homepage are NFT promotions (ads, giveaways, influencers). Just saying. Bye!"
61,What P2E games are actually being played? #p2e #NFTs
62,@ParikPatelCFA @dougboneparth Learning to hold
63,"@Tytaninc Sure, but it will probably also wipe some newcomers"
64,"Long story short, there are so many giveaways nowadays, but I would like to know if an average collector ever wins."
65,Who has ever won a free mint? (like = no)
66,Who has ever won an ETH/SOL price? (like = no)
67,Who has ever won a free NFT? (like = no)
68,4 Questions Sunday: Who has ever won a whitelist? (like = no) #NFTCollection
69,"We have heard a lot of noise on Twitter lately about hyped mints and auctions like @Pixelmon &amp; @InvsbleFriends. It is totally fine to invest, as long as the investors have knowledge and experience in similar projects. If not, people will be ripped off (and feel so) #NFTGame"
70,"Damn, I predicted this in the morning; I just noticed. Luckily words and actions came through 💛 Thank you! https://t.co/pd03m8xmtZ"
71,"A friend of mine joked around today, make jpegs instead of war; it will be a lot more fun, they said. I couldn't agree more... #NFTGame #UkraineWar"
72,"The last few days have been tough on all of us, going to bed with bad news and waking up asking ourselves what happened during the night again. Keep your mental game strong! 💛 #UkraineRussia"
73,"The BIG question after the SWIFT decision is, will Russia move to #bitcoin to stabilize the finances of their war?"
74,@fiveoutofnine Yes or ideally the platforms like OS are facilitating these workflows for founders and minters.
75,"@cryptoein Besides the Mories situation, why do you have 80% of your holdings in 1 collection 🤯"
76,For all the #BAYC’s that were bought in the past few weeks - This is not “just the beginning”; you are just beginning. Sorry!
77,@BTC_Archive It is better that they do not 😅 since governments will blame and shame bitcoin.
78,@SolanaLegend SOLow
79,@SpaceXStarlink this is your time to prove your value ;) https://t.co/4vZIyTKtW5
80,"With all that is happening in the world 🌍 - What is, according to you, the safest asset at the moment? #bitcoin #GOLD #RealEstate #stockmarkets"
81,@tmagled We need introductions in Twitter usernames and pfp masks.
82,"I am noticing many people leaving their fulltime job to focus on #web3 full-time. That's the spirit we need, risk-takers."
83,"@tommyk_eth We should be negative before we can get positive, optimistic, and trusting."
84,The story of the @Pixelmon mint… Why are we investing so much time and money in projects like this while passionate founders and artist are fighting for every item? There is something wrong in this world 😅 #NFTGame
85,"@andrwwang Beautiful initiative, thank you!"
86,@simonlapscher If you want to do it right the DAO has to vote about everything that will be cleaned 🙃
87,@tommy_kayyy Take care of your health. One part of doing that is to have less invested 😂
88,"@chriscantino Yesss, keep it in your pockets. The more you grow organically the better the deals and power for you and your business."
89,"RT @sblikstad: The Web3 landscape. 

We are on the cusp of another paradigm shift, enabled by open data, cryptographic keys, and digital as…"
90,@BabyDogeReports No
91,"@Jethroe111 @WClementeIII Higher prices mean more activity, so I wouldn’t stare blind on this metric as the price goes up ⬆️"
92,@WClementeIII I'm kidding. Most of it is institutional and not being moved for more extended periods (which might mean they are here for the long term = positive).
93,"@WClementeIII Good job, Twitter HODLers 😆"
94,@cburniske An influencer in web3 should be independent and listen to its followers.
95,"My research was based on potential community size, long-term purpose, a bit of healthy sense, and relatively low floor prices."
96,I bought myself some lovely gifts before the weekend started (after doing some hours of research). Do you like them? @artblocks_io @WhaleTogether @BMC_NFT @StonerApeClub #nftart #NFTCommumity #utility https://t.co/mzFftaQMfL
