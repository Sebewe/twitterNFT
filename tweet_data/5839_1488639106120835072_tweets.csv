23,@olde_craig @jonoclegg I always imagine them giving 20 cents to 5k people. Then all that gas 😂
24,@Octopunksclub Yea exactly. Super easy and fair. Theyd be able to WL their friends but not more than once.
25,This is my point exactly. We need more accountability. #eth #nfts #crypto #Brokensea @jonoclegg https://t.co/woJmKuHRnT

28,@Bohdi0x76 @Ty_The_Person @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT How did you WL?
29,@DeFiGregg @5kipp_eth @WeatheReportNFT Artist came came out saying he pretty much not getting artistic credit for his work. Wanted to renegotiate deal then got outed completely from project.
30,@Ty_The_Person @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT I'd be down to give up my @WeatheReportNFT for @DentedFeelsNFT WL. I'd even go so far to mint and give it to the artist for WL.
31,@Ty_The_Person @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT WL still available?
32,"@5kipp_eth @WeatheReportNFT Still debating honestly, I mean if they can't be straight up about what happened then what kind of other info could they be withholding?"
33,@Ty_The_Person @WeatheReportNFT @DentedFeelsNFT I'm seriously considering against it. Is that mention the artist who did Weather report?
34,"Who's still minting #weathereportnft tommorow? Is the FUD from the artist making you think twice? I got WL, but I'm not sure if I will end up doing so.  @WeatheReportNFT"
35,"@Octopunksclub The problem is, these projects aren't transparent about the winners of their WL or their giveaways. My plans are to change this and create a new standard. Just like my last giveaway, I posted transaction and everything. This will be the case for WL also."
36,"@olde_craig @AlphaLand @depressedapeRC @MedicatedMice @nft_astros @CyclopsCR @crookznft @coffeebreak_YT @NFT @mcuban Definitely a different generation. Need some smart, honest, and young people to pioneer this space."
37,"@olde_craig @AlphaLand @depressedapeRC @MedicatedMice @nft_astros @CyclopsCR @crookznft @coffeebreak_YT @NFT @mcuban I actually don't mind him. He's finally switching sides, and seems more on the ball. I've seen O'leary talk and he has pretty good sense about him. Idk about an NFT VC fund tho. They gotta stop trying to blockchain everything."
38,@olde_craig @AlphaLand @depressedapeRC @MedicatedMice @nft_astros @CyclopsCR @crookznft I just saw the @coffeebreak_YT  vid on the IG profile @nft and @mcuban involvement. I swear he fell into his wealth. Guy is so clueless.
39,@SowingSeason140 @Mythical_NFT Can I see the OS link to the one you hold?
40,@olde_craig @AlphaLand @depressedapeRC @MedicatedMice @nft_astros @CyclopsCR @crookznft All part of the cycle. NFTs still pretty young so market structure still needs to build. We need an NFT marketplace where project owners need to DOXX to enter imo. Get rid of more rugs. Still the wild west.
41,"@olde_craig @AlphaLand @depressedapeRC @MedicatedMice @nft_astros @CyclopsCR @crookznft Definitely not NFT season rn. Holding a lot of stuff I'm down on, but have a decent amount of faith in what I'm holding. Good to know about Crookz tho!"
42,@olde_craig @AlphaLand @depressedapeRC @MedicatedMice @nft_astros @CyclopsCR @crookznft I got WL for crooks. Minted 3. Got a pretty rare one I flipped for 1 ETH and still have the other 2. What's going on with that project?
43,@olde_craig Soon my friend. Very Soon

61,"@Bohdi0x76 This reminds me of the first virtual reality hype with the Nintendo ""Virtual Boy"". Lots of hype at that time to enter this ""meta-verse"", but the technology just wasn't there yet."
62,"I'm wondering if the #metaverse is just a pipe dream being shoved down our throats to get us, as consumers, to buy into this hype. I mean realistically, does anyone have a legitimate plan as to how this is going to go? Too much racing to advertise without any working prototype."
