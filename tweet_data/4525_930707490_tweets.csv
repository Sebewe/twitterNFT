14,Talent is your innate ability to do something naturally. It’s great to be proud of our talents but I feel we should be even more proud of areas in life we have become proficient where we had no talent because that takes hard work and dedication.

70,@TownTrojan @RealRickyMorton @DaxFTR Above; pathetic man continues to comment about things he knows nothing about.
71,@TownTrojan @WWEGraves @WWE @YouTube @CarmellaWWE @barewithuspod Spreading love and joy 👆🏼👆🏼
72,@TownTrojan @JimHughes301 @Machobeard4life They didn’t have to release her for that. They could have kept her under contract but they chose to release. You still don’t know what you’re talking about.
73,@TownTrojan @JimHughes301 @Machobeard4life Both released right there in the article. Just take your L and move on dude the cops are gonna have to come get me for murder soon

78,@TownTrojan @JimHughes301 @Machobeard4life He got let go by them. They didn’t have to fire him but they did. Wrong again BiG sUrPrIsE!
79,@TownTrojan @Machobeard4life Wow very profound.
80,@TownTrojan @JimHughes301 @Machobeard4life Incorrect he is bound by his contract. If he doesn’t come to work or tries to work elsewhere he could be sued. Again you don’t know what you are talking about.
81,@TownTrojan @JimHughes301 @Machobeard4life You can’t just quit. Look at the Ali situation or the LH one before that. It’s funny to see someone commenting on something they have no clue about.
82,Really enjoyed this interview and getting the chance to talk about difficult topics that I believe should be discussed more often. We all need help in this life and seeking it out is strength not weakness. https://t.co/WjFtxgCRP0
