97,"@Carlini8N @PurrnelopesCC Also, as you suggested on spaces, having certain items effectively priced in fiat (i.e., fluctuating number of $TOKEN) might help as well."
98,@Carlini8N @PurrnelopesCC The limited nature of the reward would make people want to burn their $TOKEN and achieve the mythical burn = yield.
99,"@Carlini8N @PurrnelopesCC I think the uses for $TOKEN have to grow with the distribution of $TOKEN, otherwise the value will fall over time as the supply grows. Perhaps there could be time or size limited rewards, e.g., for the next two weeks spend 1000 $TOKEN and get a NFT of your Purr dancing."
