1,@Kloud30official Bahahahaha this is immaculate
2,@officialvaxle I definitely agree. I just feel it’s a very saturated aesthetic to go after as it’s being used soooo much. Unless you do a creative play on it that would be very distinctive. Like Tokyo Machine’s branding for example
3,"@nitepulse_ I feel that, but I personally love rocking big ass anime characters on my clothes 🤩 but that’s subjective. I’m more talking about album artwork and stuff like that."
4,Is the anime aesthetic/branding overused in the Bass music scene??
5,GM 💕💰🤩🎶
6,@ETAsounds Bro that is so understandable. Nothing to be ashamed about. My dad and I literally flew to New York for pizza because Miami’s is so weak 😬
7,"@ablueswallow Straight up, I love how much of a meme it is"
8,Honestly this shit is so funny I’m starting to vibe with it  #NewProfilePic https://t.co/DC4UtruxxL

11,"Apologies if you tried to contact me before, my DMs were closed. Just fixed that! ❤️"
12,@nitepulse_ Done!
13,"@nitepulse_ I thought they were open already, I gotchu brother"
14,"I'm here to bridge the gap between the EDM industry and the Web3 industry. If you are unsure what that means, feel free to shoot me a DM and we'll talk. I think if you're an EDM producer (or producer in general), established or not, you should have a Web3 strategy moving forward."
15,"@WhitestWizard @Pixelmon Furthermore, I'm sure if they're smart and use the majority of their funding towards the project, they can save it. I highly doubt this was a rug as there is so much behind it. I agree with you, there are some red flags. But I'm gonna take the risk and see."
16,"@WhitestWizard @Pixelmon At face value this is a red flag. But then keep in mind that he must pay salary including his own. I would not be surprised if he took a large sum of his pay out and bought more NFTs. I'm not saying this project is 100% kosher, it's anyone's guess."
17,@motrocks YESSSSS!!! Legit so many opportunities. Even from a composition standpoint.
18,@Runo_DEV @Pixelmon @RTFKTstudios It’s the project that keeps on giving 🔥🔥🔥🔥
19,"@Runo_DEV @Pixelmon @RTFKTstudios Ma bro, I’m apart of the CloneX fam 😏

This is a CLEAR blue chip 🤩 https://t.co/ZggBoFGzCH"
20,"To the people that are limiting their music because “they want to sound design everything”: samples are made to be used.

Making everything yourself can interrupt the flow of creation. You can always sound design something different after you have a solidified idea. 👌🏻😏❤️"
21,@WhitestWizard @Pixelmon Gut*
22,"@WhitestWizard @Pixelmon Agreed. All we can do is sit back and hope for the best. It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve taken a loss, and I doubt it will be the last. Hopefully my guy instinct is right for this one."
23,"@WhitestWizard @Pixelmon Yes I saw this as well, and you’re definitely spot on with saying that. I really can’t blame you. I don’t know what they were thinking on their end. I’m gonna stick around and see how they try to recover. It was definitely a massive blunder and hopefully this isn’t a rug pull."
24,"@nitepulse_ @Pixelmon They are game developers that wanted to be involved in the Web3 space. This is their first NFT project and unfortunately their lunch was extremely poor and their floor price tanked. But with 70 million in funding, let’s hope they can turn it around."
25,"@WhitestWizard @Pixelmon They have 70 million in funding and I believe that they will use that cash to try to fix their early mistakes. Early on Tesla had to recall cars in 2009 and their business was plummeting but they recovered. I’m not calling Pixelmon Tesla, but they can also recover."
26,"@WhitestWizard @Pixelmon Idk if shady is the right word… more like “executed very poorly”. But the people behind it are game developers and this is their first NFT. I’m not saying that it will 100% turn around, but I was an early believer in the project. If it fails, it fails and I lose some cash."
27,"@karmawav I’m sober, I read this, and now I’m feeling high."
28,"I copped a @Pixelmon at 1 ETH and was definitely disappointed in the art. But I didn’t cop it for the art, it’s not a quick flip project.

They’re one of the only video game projects with an actual playable build of the video game they’re making. I’m gonna stick around."
