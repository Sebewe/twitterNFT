57,@Chuck88808 Was bout to pull the trigger last night but decided not to and all the ones I was looking out already sold. Azuki is definitely getting scooped
58,@ItsTymo @wenmilk_eth @KeithGrossman Thanks for the clarification I was thinking that's how it worked. Doesn't make it easier to decide lol
59,@wenmilk_eth @KeithGrossman @ItsTymo Oh I thought it was random what you get when you burn. So a specific year will always burn to a certain artist?
60,@wenmilk_eth @KeithGrossman @ItsTymo should I burn or not absolutely no idea what to do lol
