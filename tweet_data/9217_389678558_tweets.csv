10,"MEKAVERSE and others did super cool designs before the reveal. And because the artwork is the most important thing, people were paying around $20k for NFT. And after the reveal, the whole thing just went down. Because the art is nice, but without another utility it's useless."
11,"The most important thing in NFT is art = BULLSHIT
Most influencers tell you that you have to like the art. So if the value drops to zero, you have a nice picture. But I think it's utter bullshit that people fell for and cost them an awful lot of money. Projects like HAPE,"

14,"@xBenJamminx Thank you for your reply. I see it very similarly. I hold both, but I like @nftworldsNFT a lot because of anyone who plays mintcraft can play it. So people know the mechanism of the game. So I feel like it could be the one of the first web3 games with massive adoption🚀🚀"
15,@xBenJamminx What do you believe in more - Sandbox or Nftworld? Everyone has a slightly different path. Which do you think will be more successful?
16,@Rickynft @NftUae @ape_g4ng @Nike @adidasoriginals That's exactly what I was thinking when I held the 7x mintvial you got Clone X for. So I sold 5 of them for a total of 20 ETH. Clone floor now 14 and Mintvial 28. So now I guess I hold on 😂

30,@osf_nft Appreciate your work.
31,"I believe a fair price for Re-genz and Degenz is around 2ETH. And even at that price, you'll get significantly more value from the discord that will pay for your the investment."

33,"- Other closed discord groups have much bigger floor. For example Metaverse HQ has floor 4.5. Re-genz floor is 0.15, degenz floor is 0.24."
34,"- In the discord, these two OGs share their experiences and tips. On 31.1 @OSF_NFT shared a 7 page document on why to buy a Rug Genesis. Floor at that time was 0.7. Now it is 1.3."

41,"@blargcrypto The pain will ease with time:-) I sold 7x BAYC under 4 ETH(floor 107) and also Clone - x Mintvial for 4 ETH(floor 34). It hurts, but you learn to live with it😂"
42,"@LooksRareNFT @ZoddLooksRare I cannot list NFT for sale. I verified like 4 collections already. And it always asks me to verify the collection, so I pay gas, and then when I want to put the NFT for sale and sign the transaction, it gives me an error."

I definitely sold too early.

53,"@softlysoftly @cryptocom It's unbelievable. And if I look right, there is no possibility how to get money from the card except of paying for something with creditcard? So there is no way how to invest that money from @cryptocomcs credit card."
54,@NathanHeadPhoto I think ETH is more likely to be $12k at the end of 2021. Let's place a bet.
55,"@cryptocomcs @cryptocom Unfortunately, no one answers there. But I have just basic question. Can I buy crypto via cryptocom card? YES/NO?"
56,"NFTs have the best correlation. When ETH goes down, people are afraid that crypto is already ending and so NFT prices go down. And when ETH goes up, NFTs are more expensive against the dollar, so people lower the price again. WNGMI 🤷‍♂️"
57,Hi @cryptocom Is it really not possible to buy cryptocurrencies in the app from the money I have loaded on my cryptocom card? And it's only possible from other credit cards? Or am I doing something wrong?

67,@punk6529 It seems to me that everyone is saying that Adidas hacked and abused web3. But they forget that @BoredApeYC and @punkscomic are working together on this. Are they really don't care about web3 and would let a corporation fill their pockets and nothing more?
68,@oreganone @genie_xyz @opensea Cool. Thanks a lot. I never noticed before that there is an option to select multiple NFTs at once on opensea. I've always done a transfer directly from a particular NFT and there's no way to select multiple. This will definitely save a lot of money again:-)

Never tweet the word METAMASK.

If you've got a new @Ledger or @Trezor and want to move your NFTs there to keep them more secure, then adjust your gas in Metamask. Currently you can pay anywhere from $40-$60 for a move of one NFT if you don't manually adjust the gas. But if you set the"
