1,@QuirkMaster4751 @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT I’ve been on a few!  Once owned 22 quirkies. Still own 10. Community definitely amazing.
2,@Mark2036 @doodles That covered wagon is siiiiick reminds me of Oregon grail
3,@QuirkMaster4751 @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT I love quirks. Not totally convinced of the team yet. But the art and community are both 🔥
4,@theAzimandias @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT @huxleysaga Yeah Huxley seems to be popping up a lot right now.
5,@joshual2159 @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT @ElephantNFTS Good team?
6,@OneFJefrey @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT @NakedHeadz @metashimaNFT Which has a better team?
7,@ka_dewaal @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT @3landersNFT @wolfdotgame Like which ones?  We want that early alpha 😜
8,@SKYCRYPTOBOOMER @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT @BYOPills Ok might dm. Many have talked about it.

11,@derktargin1 @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT Doesn’t look like they’re doxxed?
12,@SKYCRYPTOBOOMER @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT @BYOPills So is the trade just to buy a floor BYOPill and let it run?
13,@B_rightBrooks @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT @councilofkingz Is the team uniquely good?  Are they doxxed?
14,@SKYCRYPTOBOOMER @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT @BYOPills I mention the complexity because I find complexity a huge barrier to entry for me. Just hard to feel like I’m keeping up with the alpha.
15,@SKYCRYPTOBOOMER @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT @BYOPills Yeah it just seems so complex. I own too many NFTs. Is the team uniquely good?
16,@derktargin1 @psychedelic_nft @BossBeautiesNFT Do you think the team is uniquely good?  I don’t know much about them.
17,"When people say to invest in the best teams, Clones, Doodles, BAYC, World of Women come to mind. But the market already knows that and has priced it in. Which lower ETH projects have great teams? (Other than @psychedelic_nft and @BossBeautiesNFT - everyone knows that)."

34,@chibiapegang @derktargin1 What else has visa collected. Yes Visa was def not biz dev. But it sent floor from 40 —&gt; 125. Insane impact.
35,@chibiapegang @derktargin1 I think it was a classic web2 partnership. Both sides promoted the other to their distribution. Yuga is extremely good at biz dev.  Marketing geniuses.
36,@derktargin1 @chibiapegang Yeah it was a good deal for both parties. I think the visa punk had a similar impact but it was less of a BD deal and more of a symbolic purchase.
37,@chibiapegang Larva is definitely against plagiarism or other people profiting by selling copies of their art. If that’s anti web3 I’d agree. BAYC is no different. The v1 debacle was extremely tough but I agree Larva fumbled from a PR perspective. But that was after the IP thing.
38,@chibiapegang How many v1 do you have?  I have one punk and one v1.
39,"@chibiapegang Also. I own 1 ape, 1 mutant and 3 kennels. Have about 2x the BAYC exposure vs punk exposure. I just think the world was uniquely anti Larva as opposed to standing for any big principals."
40,"@chibiapegang Also keep in mind, the Adidas deal was a joint biz dev relationship. Adidas got the BAYC distribution and promotion of their NFT &amp; in exchange advertised for BAYC. This was not just a thing where Adidas loved BAYC and therefore paid 100 ETH for an ape and built a brand around it."
41,@DrJones0305 Yep. Everyone is trying to enter the gaming world and other spaces to prove “utility” but the fact is that the biggest whales in gaming spend 10 ETH in a year. That’s the price of a decent Kennel.
42,@NouNft Yes. I’m not anti derivs. Especially if an artist signs onto CC0. I just don’t believe they add value to the original set.
43,@chibiapegang BAYC when they DMCA’d Phunky apes?
44,@chibiapegang A lot of cool projects are using punks. The reason they aren’t lately is because punks are out of fashion. Not cause of the IP stuff that has never been enforced on anyone ever.
45,@chibiapegang There was the same retaliation against phunky apes. They got DMCA’ed and no one cared at all. No different from phunks. Off Opensea forever.
46,"@chibiapegang Just not true. Any company is capable of getting in touch with Larva just like Adidas did with Yuga. It was a pre-done deal. And companies *have* bought punks before. 

Either way - NFT twitter’s rage about it was absurd."
47,@chibiapegang People use punks for all sorts of things too and no one cares at all. Non issue.
48,"@chibiapegang Yes. Agree that punks have a unique place in this world. Also think punks will give IP to holders soon. And as my original post said, that will change *absolutely nothing* because no one really cares about this at all, once they’re done throwing eggs at Larva."
49,@chibiapegang I just don’t think it’s a real issue. All theoretical. Any brand could do the same with Doodles and Doodles will love it.
50,@chibiapegang The Adidas deal was worked out with Yuga. They could have easily done a deal with Larva. Larva would have loved it. Zero IP issues.
51,@chibiapegang I think Adidas could have and Larva would have loved it. Larva just isn’t into marketing anymore. Visa bought a punk and very easily could have made it pfp and monetized and it would have been great for all parties. Larva just isn’t in that game anymore.
52,"@chibiapegang This is what I generally think isn’t true. But hard to prove. 

I see both sides."
53,@chibiapegang I’m just saying (a) no one is making $100k/year off their NFT and (b) Larva has shown zero interest in enforcing anything ever. I think the whole fiasco was just people being anti Larva.
54,@chibiapegang It is just a view not saying MFers are proof. I think there’s a reasonable case that derivs increase exposure and help but I increasingly think that’s not really helping. Certainly don’t have scientific proof just my sense.
55,@chibiapegang No punk owner has ever had any problem with anything related to IP. Ever. Larva has never gone after a punk owner for everything. For all intents &amp; purposes punk owners can do whatever they want.
56,"@bluechipdipped yeah but that's not how derivs tend to operate, and certainly not how they operate in a CC world."
57,"@DrJones0305 yeah it's super challenging to figure out right now.  you have to look at two sets to understand the collection.  

I honestly increasingly think that people just want simple JPGs.  It's weird but my current view."
58,@nev_in_color @CineStillFilm @FILMWAVE_ @filmlifemag @coolfilmclub stud.  love the vibes.  great ambiance.
59,"3) The IP chat has died cause no one ever really cared about it. People were just anti-punks &amp; anti-LarvaLabs. Doodles have the exact same IP license (allows up to $100k of revs per year) and no one has ever even flinched about it.  

(bag disclosure: 3 Doodles, 1 punk, 0 MFers)"
60,"3 controversial views:

1) Awareness from derivs doesn't help OG sets. I'm not anti derivs, but I don't think they're beneficial. MFers are down since the onslaught of derivs.

2) Having 2 Doodles marketplaces for the same asset (Space + normal) is disorienting more than helpful"

80,@Femanonymously @moses23__ @Atomic__Danny @opensea @BoredApeYC I’ve done a lot of research and spoken with many of the victims and people/companies researching the hack. This was a true hack of a trusted site. Opensea has specifically said it wasn’t email phishing. I think it was a well-known mint that was compromised.
81,"I say this will all respect to people who have purple skin and wear a tuxedo.

82,@rajenruparell @worldofwomennft @ChristiesInc Yes
83,@Femanonymously @moses23__ @Atomic__Danny @opensea @BoredApeYC It was an issue with Opensea being exploited. People signed a compromised signature on a trusted website which basically gave someone access to sell their NFTs for 0 ETH later with a helper function.  Opensea’s contracts are not meant to be that vulnerable. But are.

89,@moses23__ @Femanonymously @Atomic__Danny @opensea @BoredApeYC Yeah I know a lot of people who said the harassment on NFT Twitter was what drove them off after getting hacked. It’s awful. So many low-lifes in this space.
90,@moses23__ @Femanonymously @Atomic__Danny @opensea @BoredApeYC He’s wrong. Don’t worry about Twitter trolls. Last week’s hack of 17 people was a compromised signature they signed weeks earlier that the hacker didn’t execute on until this past week.  The OpenSea contract is increasingly getting exploited by compromised signatures.
91,@moses23__ @Atomic__Danny @opensea @BoredApeYC It could be. The mint could have had something in it that you signed which compromised your Opensea actions. Just a possibility. When did you put the 70 WETH in the wallet?  You’re sure you didn’t bid 70 by mistake right?
92,@moses23__ @0x000x000x0 @opensea @BoredApeYC If the wallet has a prior interaction with a mint then it’s not new.
