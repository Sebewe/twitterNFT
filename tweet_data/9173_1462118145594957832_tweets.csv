62,@sharktoothluke @anhyeugame @areatechnology_ You could that on Canva and upload it on Opensea as far as you are describing it. So what it is exactly ? There is no description anywhere ? Where are people getting the information and what is the twitter page not giving enough information ? Is this a secret minting ?
63,"@GreedyGiraffes Of course you will and of course you will tweet about it and of course will keep track of it and of course you will use legit tools to pick up the winner. Thank you for growing your followers and engagement on our behalf ser.
