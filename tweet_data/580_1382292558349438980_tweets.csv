1,@Alvena__Lee @nexta_tv nexta will never share it - the more civilian deaths the better for them. 20 mins in they still haven't tweeted about it.
2,@ATf141 @Fearmydark @virkokka @ASBMilitary oh thank you!
3,@Fearmydark @virkokka @ASBMilitary they haven't (at least not on their website) - I also checked TASS - also the official MOD twitter account doesn't carry the warning. Can someone post a valid source?
4,@ASBMilitary you need to provide (link) to a source!
5,"@TJ_NGMI @heckman_eth And thats exactly the reason I voted ""No""."
6,@ASBMilitary can you link the source? This needs to be archived.
7,@nexta_tv the amount of fake news on this account and the idiots actually believing it is really something.
8,"@cyre2067 @realnikohouse ganggang - thanks for spreading the truth fren, I really had a feeling 100% of the nft community doesn't know whats really going on. 🙏"
9,"@CraigMurrayOrg If you ""like"" certain alternative posts that don't fit the narrative, then twitter is ghosting your own posts now, even if you have a blue checkmark. Welcome to 2022, Ambassador."
10,"@betc0in @HiPPi69eR @RWApodcast agree, finally someone pointblank telling the truth on MSM - didn't expect that lol"
11,"@ruskadevushka_ Wow, so there ARE still some smart voices in the US. Thanks for sharing."
12,"6/ Question the narrative. Dig deeper. Make up your own mind and always objectively look at both sides of any story - no mater if its politics, geopolitics or even a piece of artwork. The truth hides always somewhere in the middle."
13,5/ I am a pacifist and against this war. However I am also intelligent enough to understand and see the big picture of where this is heading. I feel sorry for those brainwashed people that don't understand whats really going on.
14,"4/ I am aware that freedom of the press died a long time ago, both in the East and the West. But at least you had the opportunity to hear both sides, make up your own mind, back in time."
15,"3/ fake news and propaganda. It is not a one way street.  If you hear only ONE side of the story it is very likely that you will be sooner or later fed propaganda and fake news, thats unavoidable. And you sheeple walk right into the trap."
16,"2/ In every conflict there is propaganda on both sides, that is nothing new. Yet people should be able to listen to both sides and come to their own conclusion based on facts and evidence. Both Western and Eastern media has been caught numerous times in"
17,"1/ This sets a very very dangerous precedent, yet people are happy. You don't realize that today its Russian TV stations, but tomorrow it might be your favorite politician or cause that is going to be silenced, because it doesn't fit the norm. https://t.co/XYxe4WvDRr"
18,"@nexta_tv What NEXTA won't tell you is that AZOV set up a recruitment station there, supposed to open and accept people at 10:00 AM. The strike was at 08:02 AM in order to avoid civilian casualties. Also, the building wasn't targeted as you can see. It was simply a warning shot. https://t.co/83F3F73pf7"
19,@edvardas_sib @VeinWhile @RWApodcast If he really didn't care about civilians he would just carpet bomb the shit out of Ukraine and this all would be over in a day.
20,@thenrthstar @THMontague @ragipsoylu They do. Otherwise all those convoys you see would not have made it this far.
21,"@VI_Millions Unfortunately most people nowadays don't even research for themselves anymore and fall right into the propaganda trap. No matter what happens at the end, most people won't accept the facts even if they're right in front of them."
22,"@PLnewstoday stay safe, and thanks for doing REAL journalism!"
23,@IuliiaMendel and over 200 (documented) children lost their lives in the Donbass region alone due to Ukrainian army mortar attacks since 2015. Or are they not important because they spoke Russian instead of Ukrainian? The truth will prevail. https://t.co/tuRpGJr6HZ
24,"@MarioRavelli those numbers are as real as ""the ghost of Kiev"" and all the other propaganda that turned out fake."
25,@AumsterNFT @opensea ♥️♥️♥️
26,@nexta_tv Reminds me of Canada.
27,"@ABigThingBadly @GutterCatGang You know I respect you bro, but thats too much ; )"
28,@guttermisscash @Noideasir2 @opensea she has still 4 more pieces from the collection listed for sale ^^
29,@PLX_01 @PebblesFluff @LordVesconte They didn't.
30,@Noideasir2 @opensea and its mine ^^
31,@nexta_tv that idiot obviously doesn't know how crypto works
32,@GrublesteiN64 I highly suggest this very balanced documentary by Oliver Stone https://t.co/1W8kA56aKs -
33,"@terrelljstarr Russia is ending a civil war targeting ethnic Russians living in Ukraine, that was backed by the West for a period of over 8 years. It's funny how one-sided reporting ha been. Ukraine had 7 years to fulfill the Minsk agreement that they signed."
34,"If the US &amp; NATO hadn't toppled Ukraine's democratically elected government back in 2014 this would not have happened. 

Ukraine had 7 years to complete the Minsk agreement, which they didn't. War is bad, but so is media hypocrisy - let's hope this will be all over soon."
35,"@exitliquidity1 @GutterCatGang @BoredApeYC I am in Chongqing, if you ever visit send me a DM ^^"
36,"@GutterCatGang @BoredApeYC *at 11:11, typo, getting drinks already ^^"
37,"Just got married. 

And yes we we're wearing @GutterCatGang and @BoredApeYC merch when signing today, on Tuesday, 22/02/2022 and 11:11 AM. https://t.co/irxRFTsk0d"

Honor &gt; Money. 

@NFTethics you might wanna put @FancyBearsMeta and @MetaHooligans on your blacklist. https://t.co/osudG58VY1"
40,"Found another interesting artist, @sunya119 and his ""Analog Doll"" collection. Picked up 3 pieces, really love the retro vibe and the hilarious combinations. And it's on Polygon ^^ https://t.co/jEmQRZxmvm"
41,can't stop collecting @AumsterNFT 's work. https://t.co/QzKGfzW3iQ
42,@Sculpture_NFT @opensea nice one - ill keep an eye on your collection.
43,"@artisanrocky @muchosarms @ShadowskeTazman @ZelenskyyUa @OSCE Agree, Russians have military bases in over 80 countries around the world and have been involved in wars 91% of its existence ... oh...wait. https://t.co/0SgOzBVgQq"
44,"@ZelenskyyUa @OSCE US/NATO in 2014: Let's topple Ukraine's government because we don't like it. 
US/NATO in 2022: We must do all we can to protect Ukraine's sovereignty and government. 

Welcome to geopolitics."
45,"@trussliz Who was supporting topping the former government and starting this whole shit show back in 2015 - oh yes, the West."
46,"@NoKapRich taxes mate ... he sold it probably to his anon wallet, e.g. to himself. Or the other way around"
47,@jnnamet 0.1 floor here we are ^^
48,"@TwoToneTommy3 @GutterCatGang nah, most people here don't even know what an NFT is ^^ probably thought its just regular ""couple shirts"" that are modern here in Asia 😅"
49,@0xbayou @jnnamet awesome brother! Some really amazing stuff hidden deep on Opensea ^^
50,"@mapenyon and a few more later ; ) I really love this quirky retro stop motion, its awesome. Btw, he reached out via DM to me - I read all of my DM's"
51,@jnnamet PS: I gonna sweep that floor in exactly one hour if you guys don't. This artist really deserves more credit.
52,"A lot of people reaching out to me - but this. Just wow. Seriously, his animations are the best thing you gonna see (and probably buy) today. Check out @jnnamet and especially his OS collection 

https://t.co/HxYeEeqkJt

I got only 5 so some of you can get some too. Just amazing! https://t.co/mbv2nUAntR"
53,@BTStwt_JJK thank you!
54,just two gutter cats conquering the streets of 重庆  🌚♥️ @GutterCatGang https://t.co/oB6cbazhCw
55,@boredapebot That has to be a compromised account? 12ETH below floor? And another one just sold for 93
56,"still looking for more talented asian artists under 2ETH of trading volume to collect their art. By now you all know what style I like. DM me, put it in the comments, thats how I found @AumsterNFT , @Noideasir2 , @Thita_style and others I started collecting."
57,"@GutterCatGang @RiotRacers - DM me, lets make it happen! https://t.co/rmGffl7Npx"
58,@holderofbags the cringe in the comments is amazing. Nice bag brother.
59,"@Cointelegraph no, its pumping because Russia is just ""withdrawing"" from the Ukraine border and the stock market is going to pump when they open today. Do you guys do any research at all?"
60,"and while I am at it - I also grabbed two more pieces by @Noideasir2 , another excellent and very talented  female artist that needs more exposure. 

You can check out her OS collection of ""Graceless Night"" at  https://t.co/3Mbh8UzieF https://t.co/pIgKJ1QMlj"
61,@AumsterNFT happy valentines day to you too :) Can't wait for the signed prints!
62,@Noideasir2 @withFND awesome as always
63,"Picked up two more pieces by @AumsterNFT - feels so good to buy something because you just like the art - and not to chase the next best flip. Stunning, piece, as always. 

Check out her whole collection at https://t.co/92U0MiwQ8e if you want to support someone with great talent https://t.co/qKGZ7JZfLC"
64,@AumsterNFT @opensea How didn't I see this earlier! Mine now ; ) Amazing piece as always
65,"@vtomatrading @ClementinesGame @BattleFlyGame almost 90k followers for @ClementinesGame does not look very organic to me ; ) Not saying they're scam, but for me personally thats a red flag."
66,"@vtomatrading @ClementinesGame @BattleFlyGame both have twitter activity less than 2 months, thats a red flag, at least for me."
67,"@nft_art_crypto @xsondx @hypebearsclub you pulled a relatively ""nice"" one. I pulled naked haribo darth vader. Thanks god I sold 2 of that crap pre-reveal ^^ https://t.co/l0BZyHJFF4"
68,"@K_MontPierre probably @GutterCatGang species, they are around that price. It's one of the the last 2021 blue chip projects that has yet to pump after bayc and several others already did. Also of course @RiotRacers with paid racing starting in March if you're into P2E"
69,"@xsondx Hyped ones you say ... like @hypebearsclub ^^ Nah, I get your point, but especially hyped ones are the most dangerous ones, cause everyone is going in with the same idea that you just mentioned. Maybe good for grinders, but way too risky IMO"
70,"Can't stress this enough to newb's: 

1) Do NOT mint new projects
2) Buy up active projects from 2021
3) GMI

There are so many cash grabs going on currently, you'll be crazy to mint anything new except its something really legit, which you newb's have no way of finding out."
71,"@boredapebot if the buyer is around dm me, i'd like to keep in touch and eventually buy it back in a few months."
72,"had to sell today my beloved #484 MAYC . Feel like shit, but need that $ to buy a house this month and getting married on the 22nd. I hope he'll be in good hands. And nevertheless, thank you @BoredApeYC for that $60k gift. https://t.co/JmU74oRbzP"
73,@tropoFarmer @economist I stayed up until 6AM local time to mint. Still worth it.
74,@JLukevich any info on when the stages start? I am banned from punks discord :D
75,Very nicely written thread showcasing the real strengths of the RIOT Racers economic model https://t.co/OaC7DQ4P7z
76,@alemsah if thats all true then your offline private key might have been compromised or you got remote hacked. Feel free to DM me and I can guide you how to set up an ultrasecure system - without ledger cause thats false security anyway. Sorry for your loss.
77,@exitliquidity1 just for flex fren
78,@kevinroose how are your penguins doin' mate
79,"@GutterCatGang comic's mint is on (!)
https://t.co/6RapYI4nQH https://t.co/Kzu9ANZkf1"
80,@_DlowT @Supremekongnft @TrustNFT not minting this crap.
81,"@kerfunkl @yugalabs @BoredApeYC the higher the expectations, the bigger the disappointment"
82,RT @EllenCriptelle: TFW you wake up to a @RiotRacers message saying the idea you put in discord a few hours ago is now on the priority list…
83,新年快乐🍾️
84,@CapetainTrippy You all don’t realise more than half of the world doesn’t even watch or care about the Super Bowl.
85,@ATHcolins Where I am you cannot shower for three days 😂
86,@Crypt0Henrry No.
87,"@suliroyale @adidasoriginals Yeah, the project itself is awesome. I just wish there will be some benefits further down the road in holding the Adidas ITM NFT's, thats all :) Cheers bro"
88,"@suliroyale @adidasoriginals Still, I am holding 5 Adidas ITM NFT's, whats the point in holding if owners will be selected for future projects based on ""luck"" - nobody is doing that [for a reason]. Now as a result they have 2k paperhands - gl with that."
89,"@adidasoriginals Adidas ""Into the Metaverse"" holders should have had at least one spot guaranteed. Apparently big brands are not yet ready for the NFT space."
90,@Noideasir2 One of your best pieces - proud owner!
91,"@akshay_thamban @OogaVerse yes, the price already corrected down to $6.5 - the following 3-4 days will show if its sustainable or not when we enter price discovery. I am still bullish, but its good to be cautious"
92,"so after 0xApes or whatever that crap is called hijacked the yello background its time for a change. Pink we go. I still don't get it why people even buy those fake ape collections, it's like getting a Nike trainer ""derivative""... meh. https://t.co/1EipS7QMrX"
93,"@christurcotte_ Because of this shit ""project"" I have to change my pfp bg color now."
94,"@Klinger8396 @OogaVerse I am trying to accumulate more mekas, especially for the pvp game in stage II. Hope to get lucky on mints ^^"
95,"not pumping my bags, but gonna admit - @OogaVerse is doing much better than I anticipated. We are still in price discovery, but $DMT is holding - $OG as expected corrected already. 

#WAGMI Oogas! https://t.co/pY36g1fRlO"
96,"👀thanks for the follow @JohnCena - DM me if you want to talk NFT's, Crypto or smashing things ^^"
97,"280ETH - 34nm top speed, 2xD6-IPS650 (1300 HP). @VitalikButerin please tell the devs to do something to make ETH 4k again so I can afford this. 

Thanks. https://t.co/H6Jh0j7VqJ"
