4,@Chris_Alisa What’s the thought process?
5,@TaschaLabs Does cash implies stablecoins in USD$ denominated?
6,@chriscantino I would choose B. Whether it’s a equity or token/coin. Why? There is no guarantee either choices would exit or not. The risk is equal. And billions dollars valuation generally has higher probability achieve its market dominance. And less likely the backers would let it fail.

13,"@Jeremy_uncooked @TaschaLabs The use case for BTC varies from each region, ie. China = move their money out, Turkey = counter inflation. For me, just a more liquid store of value (not hedge against inflation)."
14,"@gametheorizing Definitely, China is already going in CBDC route for a while now. It’s a matter of time that they will remove dependency and using eRMB to transact with other nations."

17,@gametheorizing What are the alternatives to this catch22 debt issue? Your theory revolves around a gutsy political leader making a bet for a nationalised CBDC to upgrade their monetary system that is loosely pegged to USD. It’s a long shot but definitely not impossible…

20,"@phnx311 @TaschaLabs It’s just location arb. The local economy is cheaper than developed countries. Ie. in Singapore, a graduate makes 3x more than Malaysia just because of currency exchange. But the daily expenses is NOT 3x; Starbucks coffee in Singapore cost $4-$6 while Malaysia double the price."
21,@TaschaLabs I’m from Malaysia/Singapore and it’s true that local SEA economy is struggling. It’s more profitable to actually play P2E games than to go find a job locally as a white collar graduate.
22,Projects with well-designed tokenomics are much more likely to succeed in the long term because they’ve done a good job of incentivizing buying and holding their token. Projects with poor tokenomics are doomed to failure. Supply and demand. #tokenomics101  https://t.co/hHen2KLom7

26,"@XavierHelgesen If the project don’t need another token, maybe they don’t. Coinbase &amp; Opensea don’t have tokens. Then, they are just a corp that builds in web3. If you’re investing into tokens projects, tokenomics and use cases are just as crucial. 0 use cases? Expect price dump."
27,"@XavierHelgesen You are investing from a web2 mindset. I used to be that guy too &amp; adapted to web3. If a blockchain protocol/startup operates without token, imo, that’s just a startup in web3. My example of web3; Solana is a protocol &amp; SOL needs good tokenomics &amp; utility to work."
28,"@AndrewSteinwold NEO, anyone? QTUM hello? 🤣"
29,"@clarky07 @samcallah @twobitidiot I think there are 2 camps of view in this thread; 1. There are a lot of cash grabs in this space now &amp; looks worst than ICO in 2017 and 2. At least, ETH, devs are building for the future while BTC maxi are just about tradFi to store-of-value. I think both statements are true. 🙌"

31,"@XavierHelgesen I would like to add that web3 startup with token might have additional caveats; such as tokenomics, token utility, incentives mechanism, technology itself more than the problem/market fit. It’s too early to tackle from this angle when the technology is not even mature yet. 💪"

35,@18Gglover @ASvanevik I heard the same complain about Solana core team issues during the early days when SOL is less than $3. Some VC I know cash out everything at $2 because they don’t believe Solana could be the next thing. They have shut up ever since. Real confession from a VC.
