proper due diligence takes a while, and my time is very limited

20,"stop buying stuff just cause your favorite influencer is tweeting about it

by the time you see her tweet it's probably too late and you're gonna buy mid pump

instead, take note of the project and hang in their discord until the hype dies down in a few days

dyor or get rekt"
21,"@illustramanda Hi Amanda, welcome ❤

I'm optimistic the team can work with Amanda and I've offered to help with that

I'm also upset Ms Polly experienced such a hard time"

38,"@Iam0xB0B @ritanevermind I'm not happy with any of this!

I did not propell outrage but yes I did help share Amanda's 2018 post

I even suggested the team work with Amanda and that it could be bullish

42,"@NvanhareDFS @NF_Chick I surmised this as well, but I am open to being corrected, I have personally scoured the internet for hours to find an earlier representation of ""Karma"", but it seems Amanda's 2018 IG post is the earliest

""Lily Alien"" looks different enough from Amanda's ""Karma"" character"
43,"@NF_Chick thank you 

I'm very interested to see a source for that information

when presented I will verify and share it on my feed ❤️"

59,"@Marky8882 @adrianaNFT when you list NFTs for sale, you need to give OS (or whatever platform you are listing on) approval to move that token on your behalf

this is done on the contract level for the NFT you're selling

OS has approvals to move any token from a collection you listed, unless you revoke"
60,"@adrianaNFT yes I have used this extensively, it's safe."

i think it would be cool if Amanda Costa got rich overnight from all this

just striking down the project hurts holders more than the team"
