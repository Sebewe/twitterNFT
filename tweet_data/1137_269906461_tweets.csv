We're piecing together the history of projects that ultimately resulted in the NFT tech and cultural standards we use + admire today."

There's no reason for them to give away the NFT + physical sculpture for free. But I understand your frustration. 

It'll be worth 10 ETH+ instantly so it's worth while trying to mint if you have the funds"
97,"@dprice2413 @gucci @superplastic No need to do anything other than.

&gt; Have 1.5 ETH in your wallet + gas fees.
&gt; The registration opens at 16:30 EST

98,"@g0barry @gucci @superplastic If you're lucky enough to win, the mint price is 1.5 ETH plus gas"
99,"There's a @Gucci drop in 4 hours. You might as well sign up for the free whitelist raffle, it's only open for 15 minutes, so set an alarm.

It's petty much a free lottery ticket. Even if you don't like Gucci, it's a free 10 ETH if you win.
