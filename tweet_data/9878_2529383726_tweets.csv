6,This is it guys! The last project for my Canon 70-200 f4. I gathered more data and built on my previous image of Orion complex which was only 45 minutes. I managed to get a total of 96 minutes integration and reveal more colors and fine details around the dust clouds. https://t.co/GinxwmELt5
7,"Really cold weather, snow and Orion is the perfect combination for some winter astro imaging. The strong NE wind pulled the clouds towards the ridge behind the trees but I luckily I had the time to get the shots I wanted to.🥶🌌 https://t.co/8sPW5qUsrN"
8,"Stay frosty guys! Sometimes literally 😂🥶Photographing in the cold is really exhausting physically and mentally. But you always get the best view 🌌
