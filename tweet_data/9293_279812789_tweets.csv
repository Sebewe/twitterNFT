0,@PaganD @EthereumDenver @harmonyprotocol @developer_dao @OneCommunityDAO thank you! looking forwarding to connecting @itsbarrydaly with you all as well as he plans to launch @photographerDAO very soon
1,After talking with @PaganD at @EthereumDenver I’m even more bullish on $ONE. A lot of great opportunities for web3 developers with @harmonyprotocol’s new grants program! Looking forward to @developer_dao partnering with @OneCommunityDAO this year!
2,#BlackTech needs to tap in with both @Bitcoin_Vegan and @bitcoinzay as well as all of @BlkBTCBillions sooner rather than later cause web3 is here and is moving fast. https://t.co/ahvyZxTREI

5,@MichelleBakels @developer_dao @grow_love @emmbodiment @fiigmnt @StefLikeCurry @StefLikeCurry is one of the best things to happen to @developer_dao. has been a blessing since the first townhall meeting
6,"@MichelleBakels @developer_dao @kempsterrrr true that! a recent convo with @kempsterrrr gave me a deeper level of appreciation for the work that he, @RyanCoordinator, and @grow_love are putting in behind the scenes for @developer_dao. looking forward to building with and learning from them!"
7,@Darkmythst1 @vsnaire @OrganicStonez @sirsuhayb @IbnInglor @itsjvon @andreoshea @mynameisheno @alexpark @peenpoontweets @eyesackudawgoo facts! I’m honored to be mentioned amongst such talented folks

9,@pico is by far the best “link-in-bio” app I’ve seen hands down. if they allowed for users to add custom CSS it would beat out all the other solutions

11,RT @developer_dao: Starting now! Come join @notscottmoore as we learn more about Gitcoin! https://t.co/DHNgtCzYQG
12,nah but for real. they different. I wouldn’t dare sleep on the @family. https://t.co/TXn5ukYC0L
13,@vsnaire proud of you bro! https://t.co/ScNQm2i1OC
14,@tdesseyn @renderATL looking forward to it!! 🙏🏾
15,RT @tdesseyn: stoked to hang with @renderATL speaker @isiahhill tomorrow! going to be talking about that developer dao 👀👀👀 https://t.co/0i8…
16,@irvinxyz @EthereumDenver working on OpenEra I hope!
17,@dabit3 @JoshCStein @developer_dao big facts! @JoshCStein is that dude!
18,RT @dabit3: Developer DAO @EthereumDenver IRL event 💧 @developer_dao https://t.co/jDHgrh6dTg
19,Early backers of the project will be able to nominate and vote via snapshot to help us get a list of non profits to have proceeds go to from Tyson’s NFT drop. And thanks to the team at @Radicle we will use @dripsnetwork to help streamline the split payouts to all in real time.
20,"The fact that @Tyson_Fury’s genesis NFT drop will have proceeds go towards mental health made the last minute trip out to meet him in London worth it.

All thanks to @chancellor2u for making it possible. What started out as an idea with “Proof of Philanthropy” he made a reality."
21,"@blknoiz06 never mind, check your DMs"
22,"So keep duking it out in Discord about Ethereum vs. Solana until then. Cause when the second wave of Gen Z and first wave of Gen Alpha come to crypto, it’s a wrap. Another one of the many reasons why I’m more bullish on @AlchemyPlatform and @QuickNode than anything else in web3."
23,"Chances are the people who will solve the challenges we are facing in web3 today are virtually unknown at the moment. If history is any indicator, I’d guess they are probably more concerned with passing their driver’s license test right now than they are with NFTs or crypto."
24,"Looking back at a convo @blknoiz06 and I had about altcoins back in 2017 confirms three things:

1) We don’t know anything.

2) The future of crypto and web3 will look a lot different than we think.

3) Anyone who fails to acknowledge #1 and #2 should be avoided at all cost."
25,"Many in web3 are fans of @viamirror but don’t know the level of genius @Iiterature was tapping into with CCR that had folks at GT talking about Mine, and then what he @jessewldn built with MediaChain. Put it this way, that Spotify acquisition was kept lowkey for a reason."
26,"The history of web3 needs better documentation and record keeping. Very few folks in crypto now even know the history of the technology they are building on. From NameCoin and Bitcoin Jesus to Kevin McCoy and the first NFT, it’s important to understand the roots of web3."
27,"Not too many folks who can do both. It’s one thing to be a professor and get a #1 artist/songwriter to speak to your class, it’s a whole other thing to be in the studio with them working on new songs that same day as an A&amp;R. @iStreetSymphony you’re a walking legend big bro! 🙏🏾 https://t.co/jDjUduLv4n"

33,@samecwilliams @dankvr another reason why I’m bullish on @ArweaveTeam
34,@ianDAOs @GitcoinDAO and @Developer_DAO
35,Shoutout to @dorculas and the team @MintSongs for genuinely caring about artists and wanting to see them be successful in web3. You all’s support of @IbnInglor has been greatly appreciated!
36,"@NatalieCrue I was trying to be nice lol, but that’s real though. It’s challenging because most people will take a hit simply because they aren’t aware of the numerous cultural nuances outside of their own, and then there or those who are too prideful to be open to new worldviews."
37,"In the UK helping a client with digital PR, and as I think through the strategy my mentor and I discussed for this athlete, he doesn’t need it nearly as bad as many leaders in web3 do.

Web3 is a ticking time bomb of PR scandals. Half of these DAOs aren’t prepared at all."

60,@kayssier_ @BeezSLS @KarimaDigital keep no more than 10% or ideally only keep enough in that wallet to mint or collect NFTs you want or plan to buy
61,@Kianawithaw @KarimaDigital @BeezSLS Depending upon how new you are to crypto the best Ethereum DeFi wallet to use right now is @rainbowdotme. They have a simple UX flow and UI design.

64,Shoutout to @mynameisheno for putting me on to @clarityteams! Lowkey just became one of my new favorite tools in web3
65,They should consider changing the NFL overtime rules to match NCAA because the fact that the Bills loss off of a coin flip is crazy. They never got a chance to even score in OT.
66,@IpekMorel @starpause @mintbase 👋🏾 isiahhill.near
67,@0xMaxB @developer_dao 💯 yeah it’s definitely changed the way I look at web3 altogether!

78,Stetson Bennett really did that. Threw 2 touchdown passes in 4th quarter to win the national championship after being slandered all season. UGA fans owe him a huge apology.
79,Huge fan of what @sloikaxyz is doing for #NFTphotography. If you’re an NFT photographer definitely checkout what @tchebotarev and @freeatnet are building at Sloika
80,@sloikaxyz @itsbarrydaly
81,"Lowkey majority (if not all) of @CosmosIBC tokens will do numbers Q1 of this year. I wouldn’t be surprised to see IBC tokens like $AKT (@akashnet_), $BAND (@BandProtocol), and $JUNO (@JunoNetwork) increase in price by 2-3x before the end of the quarter."

99,@jhamar speaking more so towards web3 orgs  tracking KPI’s centered around monetary value or are VC backed and need to show ROI. so not the “public good” projects or non-profit DAOs
