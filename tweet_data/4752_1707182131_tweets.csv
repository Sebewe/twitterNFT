54,@ryder_ripps That’s a weird thing to do while someone’s interacting with you.
55,"@ryder_ripps What a gamble? I’m not specifically talking about bayc. Im talking about investments in general. When ppl invest in things, you take into account many decisions. The entire point is the only ppl who can get hurt are the investors. Hopefully it’s not true. That would be terrible"
56,@mattgee Have you met my friend https://t.co/eiW4D5ySJP
57,@ryder_ripps Which significantly drops**
58,@ryder_ripps Over 12 months switches an investment to a long term cap gains with significantly drops the tax rate
59,@ryder_ripps Unfortunately when it comes to taxes and investments. It’s not that easy
60,"@ryder_ripps This, if true, unfortunately will only hurt the investors, like me. It will destroy innocent ppl who have invested all of their money into a project they thought would reap rewards. If true, it needs to be discussed and called out. But be careful if hurting thousands of ppl."

88,@AdvanceSapiens Please correct me if I’m wrong. I first looked in the Internal Revenue Code and noticed that section 115 has nothing to do with payments or earnings.
