1,"@benbrain_ Talent wise Luka is unmatched, no one works harder than Giannis 

Also, 

Giannis already has a chip so hes solidified 

Tough choice to be honest"

What goes up must come down, but if the team continues to build during hard times it almost inevitably rips to an ath during bull markets

44,"6/ Remember all it takes is one good trade to make it big &amp; grow your portfolio

You can have 10 bad plays chasing the pump of the day then make it all back by making one good play ie. coolmans universe 0.3eth–&gt;2.6eth

Whats the lesson ?"
45,"5/ Everyone has an entry strategy but never an exit strategy, why?

Emotions drive us and lead us both consciously and unconsciously

If you feel the need to check floor prices everyday/every hour/ every min

You have too much invested"
46,"4/ The goal of an investor in the space is to preserve your capital 

Think longterm

Do not set yourself up for failure by over leveraging in trades based off emotion 

Not everything that glitters is gold, dont fall in love with all your plays"

If you’re on the sidelines its time to get off your wallet &amp; have some skin in the game!"

If you want to succeed in nfts imo its more beneficial for you to participate"

How we interpret that information is different for everyone, i might be bullish on one thing while someone else isn’t

Content creators sometimes take some time to release that information in a digestible format"
50,"By the time alpha makes it onto youtube, tiktok, instagram, twitter, reddit etc. its too late 

Get to the source, be active on discord &amp; spaces

By the time its on social media its been watered down by someone who their own perspective to it

Wym?  🧵/"
