3,"@for3v3ern00b It would be to fast, we want some barrier to give people time and make it as fair as possible (not that is makes much difference). The barriers created will be different/cater to a range of people. E.g. the anime quiz we did the other day."
4,"We will continue to switch up our entry process to ensure everyone has a fair chance to get in.

While I can understand the frustration, we believe this is the best way to form a solid foundation and will have great benefits for everyone.

I hope you can understand our reasoning"
5,Slow discord growth also allows us to be more hands on with members when they enter and lay the foundations we want which is extremely important to the macro success of this project.
6,"We have no interest in inflating discord numbers to boost perceived hype.

Yes it means you don’t get ‘easy’ access to discord but its one of the only ways to ensure we maintain the quality and eliminate bots.

Dropping a straight link would allow botting."
7,"As always, our goal is to uphold the quality of Hikari in all aspects, community building is no different. 

For us, our discord is for our true supporters to congregate in, project info will always be on our twitter or website (when released)."
8,"Another 1000 members inside discord in 4 minutes. The support you guys can are showing us is incredible.

Just to touch on something I’ve seen comments about and that’s frustration with our discord entry protocol…"

Note: We said we will cater to all time zones 👀"
29,"As always, all aspects of Hikari will be crafted to the highest standard. No bots, no fake engagement, no community manipulation. 

There will also be many opportunities for the wider NFT community to be onboard soon but having this anime community foundation is crucial."
30,"1200 new members in 3 minutes. 90% success on a 6 question quiz was required.

This release was designed for our Anime fans. We got a little carried away at the start and made it to difficult (our apologies), but we quickly changed it to cater to a wider group of anime fans."

35,"Even though we tried to create some barriers today to allow more time for you all (a code break was needed), we definitely didn’t expect 800 of you to figure it out in 3 minutes!"
36,"By limiting the access to our discord, it eliminates the risk of bots, allows us to form a strong community foundation that understands our vision, and ensures that only our die hard fans have an opportunity to benefit from what’s inside."
37,"To the many that missed out on todays initial discord opening, we hear you.

As always, our first priority is quality. While many projects push large discord numbers resulting in a significant impact on a communities quality, we’re taking a slightly different approach."
38,@PurpleGary123 Noted. Timezones and warnings will be taken into consideration on our next opening.
39,"Due to the surge of traffic inside our discord server, there are 400+ users still stuck inside the verification section. If this is you, don’t stress. You have made it into the discord but you will need to give the bot time to work through the backlog. Thanks for your patience ⚔️"

This will ensure the most deserving in our multi-talented community are able to benefit from minting during our WL.

Our team has been intensely analysing the respective whitelisting methods of successful project.

It is evident that the short term success of a project is heavily influenced by the quality of its WL.

Hikari will not be market dependent. When we know we can launch on any day of the week, on any month of the year, without any disruptions to our overall vision - we know we’re ready."
