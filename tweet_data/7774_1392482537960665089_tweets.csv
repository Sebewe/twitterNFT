4,"3/ We need more verbose and human readable statements to what every interaction with a smart contract is doing. 

Credit card companies are already doing it, we should too."
5,"2/ when doing anything on metamask you can always click on the data tab to see what function it is interacting with and what values are being sent over. 

This is by no means a solution to the problem, as most folks aren't familiar with the functions of a contract"
6,"1/ It's not just about opensea. It's a fundemental UX problem.

Users have no clue what they are signing or approving.

After signing so many contracts it becomes muscle memory, they assume that every other contract is safe cause it looks so similar."
