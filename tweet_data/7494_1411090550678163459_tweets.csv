It is also impossible to see traits of each project - such as does it have a real female artist?"
48,"@_LegendPhoenix @cryptostacys @NFTs_girl IMHO this is the worst aspect of the NFT space.

People are so attached to ""value of purchase"" they can't have a civil discussion about key issues, even with legitimate concerns.

Article is about vaccine hesitancy. It applies to people who are anti-crypto &amp; anti-NFT.
