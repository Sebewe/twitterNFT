1,"Most NFT projects are selling hype, marketing, and FOMO and bundling them as art, community, and utility.

Theses are the projects that will be forgotten once the hype fades away."
2,@mattmedved Kevin for president!
3,"@jpegdigital @manifoldxyz Permissions are a big thing too, allowing an external 3rd party application, dApp, marketplace, game, or other creator have permission access to minting tokens on your creator contract unlocks some amazing use cases."
4,"Also, a common question I've been asked is if we are using ERC-721A? The answer is no. We are leveraging the Manifold Creator extension architecture to optimize gas fees.

ERC-721A optimizes for mint costs but is more &gt;10% expensive overall when transfers are factored in."
5,"The gas savings are amazing, here is an example of @swolfchan minting 200 tokens using batch minting for his NiftyGatway drop.

6,"Batch minting of tokens comes to @manifoldxyz Studio 🚀

So happy to roll this feature out. I've been manually batch minting tokens for a handful of creators. https://t.co/MxDzA82Bm9"
7,@nnnnicholas We already provide artists with self hosted on-chain no fee auction front ends. We are staying away from off-chain for now because that is a more centralized solution.
8,"Space @doodles We have lift off 🚀🚀🚀

9,@talktimeband Most people arn't self-aware or maybe they just don't know what real art is.
10,"@anamelesshorse Just looking at the crazy hype and valuation of some of theses pfp collections, compared to the valuation of work of some well deserving artists."
11,"When I started collecting NFTs, it was all about the art. 

It feels like its no longer all about the art..."
12,@MonicaJalali @KeithGrossman Looks like @KeithGrossman has excellent taste ❤️💙
13,"@KarenSperling Hi Karen, they are still working on it I believe, I don't have an updated timeline or any news on when this feature will be available within Foundation."
14,"I've seen what is coming for @doodles, its gonna blow all your minds.

LFG 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕 https://t.co/kVNGuC0EWm"
15,@prom3th3us_x Begs the question what you are actually buying when you buy an NFT?
16,"People who bought Pixelmon for 3 ETH when they could have just gone on upwork and hired the artists for $100.

Theses massive hype cycles for NFT projects can't be good in the long run and the health of the ecosystem. https://t.co/Qa65HZ0RJE"

20,"Everyone time MetaMask changes their UI I die a little. Especially when trying to mint something urgently 😖

As much as I appreciate the UI changes, its always shocking when I see a new and unexpected screen that needs to be deciphered. https://t.co/wl5rP0c933"

23,"Friend: You free for lunch? 
Me: Sorry, an NFT drop is happening.

Friend: What about dinner?
Me: another NFT drop...

Anyone else plan their entire life schedule around NFT drops?"

27,@fvckrender @GirleeNFT @victormosquerar This is the CC0 content that we don't deserve.
28,"@withmattkim @blockdropspod Yup we've done this many times for various projects, not hard to implement at all but really depends on the objectives of the project and creator."
29,"My thoughts and prayers go out to all those in Ukraine. 💙❤️🇺🇦

When can we all move to the Metaverse where there are no borders and we are all one and the same."

I'll be talking with @farokh on @RugRadio about some of the basics about Tokens and Smart Contracts. Part of a larger education series on blockchain tech, NFTs, DAOS, and crypto security. 

Starting now!

39,"I predict that web4 happens once we all connect our brains directly into the Metaverse, thus making the Metaverse our new base reality."

42,"@DCLBlogger Before NFTs I was just playing Zelda and not really doing all that much. I stoped playing the day I learned what an NFTs I stop playing. 

Link is waiting for me to return to Hyrule only to find I'm never coming back."

45,@pixel_jindo @TokenNDN @riterabbit I burned after the burn mechanism was activated. I was testing to see if tiles worked since MakesPlace codes their NFTs funny.
46,@evankeast No joke! You've got the A++ team on this one.
47,"@DrueKataoka @opensea @rothken @manifoldxyz @originalspin @belikewater893 @KatColeATL We are all still pioneers. It goes to show how early and how primitive our tools and understanding of the decentralized web is.

Things will get better as we improve the tools and collective understanding of web3."
48,@iFirebrand Watching what is going on over there. I pray everything works out and everyone stays safe.
49,"The only war I'm interested in is a gas war.

50,"@DerekBarrera Building a following takes time.

Be authentic and genuine, set your profile to a PFP, help others though education and stories, show off the cool stuff you've been building and get people excited about what you are building.  

Also everyone loves a good shit post here or there."
51,"@gregskril @rtfshl Revoking disallows a contract / address to act on behalf of a tokens owner.

A malicious signature could be used to grant a token authorization. Order of operations matter, but also the contents of what transaction is being signed."
52,"@rtfshl Yes, 100% signatures can be more dangerous than approvals, you can hide anything inside a signature including a direct transfer of an NFT or a token approval.

There are good uses for signatures, but the UI and usability for signatures is probably the biggest issue."
53,"@JKrantz It would make revoking and actually knowing what your exposure actually is traceable. I think the big thing that MetaMask needs to spend a few cycles on is usability.

I'm a developer and half the time I have to spend hours to figure out what is actually going on with MetaMask."
54,"A common question about transaction signatures.

Q: How do I know if I've signed a bad transaction in the past?

A: You can't tell. There is no record of past signed transactions. 

MetaMask really should store a log of all signed transactions for review after the fact."
55,"Topics so far:
• Setting up a hardware wallet
• Storing your seed phrase properly
• Common scams 
• How token approvals work
• Wallet setups (hot, cold, multi-sig)"
56,"I've been putting together step-by-step guide beginner to advanced crypto and NFT security concepts.

While twitter threads are great, I think having a resource page with a checklist that you can follow would be better.

Anyone have any topics they want to see covered?"
57,"@cmbarce1 The question is what did you sign? there are different types of signatures, hard to tell without context. It could be signing a message or signing a transaction."
58,"@GusR511 Yes revoking helps, but that is only one attack vector. 

It's more about understanding what it means and when / how to use it."
59,"The recent OpenSea phishing attack, shows just how fast bad, wrong, and mis-information can travel. 

Crypto security education is something that everyone needs to spend time and invest in.

You don't know what you don't know."
60,"@wetpotatobrain @GuidoDisalle and hide yo NFTs.

I can't believe I own this meme. lol"
61,"@RogerDickerman @ohhshiny This thread goes no where. 

I had a call with @ohhshiny the other day, by this logic even I should be “guilty” of whatever is being accused. 🤷‍♂️"
62,"@drbentonbanner @ntentart @manifoldxyz Done using a standard ERC-721.

ERC-721 has its trade offs (which most don't talk about), and advantages, but we've decided the the standard 721 is the best going forward."
63,"@YOKOMSON @shellgameshill It was not, the bid came from Patricio of POAP. People can believe what they want to, but the bid was authentic. Not going to try to convince people as I have better things to do. Do I regret not selling, not one bit!"
64,@IDrawCharts @YOKOMSON 🥲🟦🟥
65,@GrantYun2 Hopefully you can have your cake and eat it too! If all goes well then Manifold contracts will be supported by SuperRare.

77,@muratpak Exist to create.
78,"If you are working on an NFT project along side artists, treat them fairly, respectfully, and as partners. 

I'm tired of seeing teams and project founders treat artists poorly and the art as a commodity. 

Artists are the ones who make this space."
79,@mintfaced What are you trying to connect wallet too? Manifold has an SDK that allows easy wallet connect to websites.

91,"@Bornosor @sharafi_eth @opensea The transactions all originate from the source address, whoever created them had access to the keys for the wallet. It sounds like the seed phrase was compromised."

98,@squibxix @victormosquerar I love this 💙❤️
99,"@DCLBlogger The price should provide upside to the community and those early believers early. But not incite the flippers who are just in it for the flip.

Most artists I work with try to go lower to provide value to the community, but not too high that it feels cash grabby."
