1,Its not stocks or crypto. People buy NFTs for different reasons. You wouldn’t wanna buy #kevin if you fav influencer us buying. If you like it go aheAd
2,Try and find the team of the NfT projects at other socials too. Artists usually have more following on instagram
3,@Medium have so much info i found  historical NFTs there Pixelmap and plasma bear
4,Spend time in Discord i know its not possible for everyone but its surely pays back to hang out in discord for your homework not for WL
5,Use @twitter its literally the best place for NFTs.
6,DYOR means do your own research #NFTs
7,Think of it as every business will be coming into NFTs as @garyvee says
8,PFPs cant stay at the top forever. We need to study other genres too.
9,"Art, Utilities, communities, roadmaps are all different things to study."
10,Thankfully there are lots of good resources to learn and understand this technology now. These are not just jpegs to make money.
