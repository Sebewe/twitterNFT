🤝 @HorseNest 
Awesome way to end 2021! Can't wait to see what sort of trouble these two get into in 2022... @jenkinsthevalet #BAYC #MAYC https://t.co/6p3E9eroDv"
42,"@androolloyd @jenkinsthevalet Upside: Free royalties, participation in first-ever NFT book helped being written by the community. Downside: None. The license is a non-exclusive license, thus allowing you to license your ape/mutant's IP to other projects in the future!"
43,"@MrR1333 @jenkinsthevalet The tickets are one of 4 tiers of Jenkins NFTs, but they all split royalties equally - only difference is how your ape physically appears or is mentioned in the book"
44,I’m still looking for any apes or mutants who want to partner up with my 2 tickets @jenkinsthevalet! Deadline fast approaching!
45,@thebrennanhall Yo I’ve got two tickets but can’t dm you. Can do both your ape and mutant!
46,As a huge @warriors fan I'd love to partner with @StephenCurry30 and @22wiggins to get their #BAYC apes licensed with @jenkinsthevalet tickets to earn royalties on a book written by a 10x NYT Bestselling author! Let's make it happen!
47,"Any @BoredApeYC apes or mutants want to partner up with me to split royalties from the first NFT + community-generated book ever?! I have 2 @jenkinsthevalet tickets, DM me if interested!!"

58,@pablostanley Count me in!
59,"@cory_eth @Kapuster @0xburn_ @JohnKnopfPhotos @MartyNFT Fully agreed. This situation aside, was asking from a practicality &amp; future use case perspective. There will always be bad actors, so how do we handle those best and with civility? For example, in this case looked like someone was even impersonating the bad actor “Marty”"
60,@Kapuster @0xburn_ @JohnKnopfPhotos @MartyNFT @cory_eth Genuine question: there is more than one “John Knopf” in the world. Certainly few (maybe 1!) in the NFT / ENS ecosystem though… for now. Trying to define/police “squatting” feels like a quickly dangerous game?
