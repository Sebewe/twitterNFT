9,Gm - Fresh Produce by @GrantYun2. The first piece I ever bought on SR about a year ago. Was immediately drawn to his unique style which stands out from the rest of what’s being created in this space while reminding me of many artists I was drawn to growing up https://t.co/WuTvBh7PTc

48,@anamelesshorse Yeah that’s what scares me. People see a guy with a nice punk and lots of followers and blindly take their word for it. Extremely dangerous behavior.
