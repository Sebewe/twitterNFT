5,@Crypdography_ @EdgeBitcoin Saw from an official source that only 32 people were affected. That’s not that many emails.
6,@blknoiz06 We are on CT. Everybody here is in the top 1% of intelligence. All I see here is anons being humble....
7,"@pto_0x @punk6529 Saw a similar discussion earlier about how no wallet incorporates a good “transaction to English” feature, such as “Sell 1 BAYC to 0x2D... for 0 ETH?”. As of now, it would be easiest to implement with common contracts (OS NFT txns, Revokes, etc.), but it is a great first step."
8,"@pto_0x @punk6529 I think these will come as the space matures, certainly. Especially with your big players like Coinbase. My view is completely biased as a technologically adept person, but I totally understand why this will be necessary in the future, especially if we want mass adoption."
9,"@pto_0x @punk6529 Haha yeah I agree, which piggybacks on why I said education is the most important piece, such as educating how to use an offline wallet and the only interaction it should have is with your hot wallet. Personally, I am very pro no guardrails/close to complete decentralization."
10,"@pto_0x @punk6529 Security gets to a point where one would start asking if it is too centralized, counteractive to the whole point of the space. Education is the most powerful tool we could use right now. Offline wallets, if used correctly, would save the vast majority of NFT buyers."
11,"@pto_0x @punk6529 I agree, probably not realistic for most people. But I also don’t believe better security solutions would help very much. Most scams/attacks thus far have been shown to be some form of phishing. “MetaMask Support”, “OpenSea Team”, etc. Easiest bet for most is an offline wallet."
12,"@penguin_curator @0xfoobar If you use a hardware wallet as you are supposed to, yes it would help. Alas, many don’t."

44,I think the allow lists for new NFT collections have run their course...it’s an awful system. ESPECIALLY the ones that require engagement farming. Needing to fast gas a hyped project never worked against my favor...$600+ gas fees always seem to be counteracted by price action.
45,"@badlydrawndobs @nft_apex @Neopabo2 @PuffYatty @aloroler Haha no kidding. I think @nft_apex knows a bit what they are talking about, but not enough background technical knowledge.

50,@Jedih_DaVinci @YvngNox @alienfrens You should be fine to keep your wallet. Just lost some ETH.
51,"@YvngNox @alienfrens Not sure. Did you ‘mint’ one? If you did, send me your address so I can take a look at the contract and analyze it."
52,@YvngNox @alienfrens Btw this doesn't apply if you interacted with the contract on the scam site. Not sure what the contract does. Looks like it's only taking a small amount of ETH though.
53,@YvngNox @alienfrens Absolutely. It is only the discord that is compromised. It is theoretically impossible to drain your NFT's/Wallet just for owning a fren. Should be some nice sales tn!
