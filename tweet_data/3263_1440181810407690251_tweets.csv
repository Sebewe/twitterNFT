1,@truewu @BoredApe1000 @osf_nft people want it for the meme value it seems
2,"@eth_ben @ZeustraJake @boolishh @sepsauce @cr0ssETH @doodles exactly. tradeoff for that dilution was more brand reach, which I’d argue is more important than collection scarcity for BAYC. smart move on yuga’s part"
3,"@boolishh @ZeustraJake @sepsauce @cr0ssETH @doodles On the flip side of the coin, I strongly believe mayc allowed a lot of people who would be priced out of a genesis ape a chance to join the BAYC community which in turn hugely helps to grow the reach of the brand."
4,"@ZeustraJake @boolishh @sepsauce @cr0ssETH @doodles Personally I think “derivative airdrops” are a good idea for some projects, not all though, and I get why people value collection scarcity. Guess the doodles wanted to try something diff, cool mechanism they’ve got with the space doodles, interested to see how it goes."
