4,Hot take: the @InvsbleFriends art isn’t thaaaat cool and the lack of utility and legitimate community will level it out to around 2 $eth

32,"@mart1ndoteth @nftworldsNFT The reason NFT PFPs are actually a thing is because you can prove ownership and store your proof of ownership publicly and immutably, without the reliance of an organization that can be influenced or destroyed. This idea is what is driving this innovation."
33,"@mart1ndoteth @nftworldsNFT You can take the NFT world and use it elsewhere…? It’s not married to Minecraft, it just currently is programmed to work best on the same platform. The fact of the matter is conventional Minecraft players store their data on Minecraft’s servers. NFT worlds data is on blockchain"
34,@mart1ndoteth @nftworldsNFT I think there’s contradicting views of ownership is here. Minecraft is centralized. The non existence of Minecraft removes the existence of the world you created on it but not with NFT worlds. And there’s value in that.
35,@ovokrisv @fishyfamNFT Bingo
36,@mart1ndoteth This is true. And since it’s so new price and valuation is very volatile and the less players involved = the more influence the individual has in shaping these metrics.
37,"@mart1ndoteth I think the idea is that you do in fact “own” it, it’s not that you created it on Minecraft’s servers - you do own the world separate and apart. Is this worth 45,000 dollars? Not to me. But the collective market is what determines price/value, not me or you."
38,"@mart1ndoteth 1. I think you’re missing the point of ownership especially as it relates to NFT worlds - Minecraft = no ownership
2. The utility NFTs can bring are far reaching outside of art. Will most of these PFP projects go to 0? Probably. Is the idea/tech behind NFTs any less valuable? No."
39,@holyskullynft Gm
40,What are some things that are confusing or hard to understand in the #NFT or #crypto space??
41,@Degentraland That first one got me 😂😂
42,The art is unique but good and the supply is low. Anything else you like about the project???
43,There are also half the amount as typical projects leading to far less of a supply. This will make it easier for the price floor to rise.
44,"From browsing the listings, each one is evidently very unique, but none of them, especially the one’s at price floor level, have me thinking “eh I don’t really like that”. I’m sure if you’ve done browsing of other projects there have been cheap NFTs where you have thought that ^"

I hope you enjoyed and thank you for getting to the end. Show some love by retweeting if this helped!! Happy investing! #WAGMI"
54,"15/ Conclusion:
At the end of the day, that is basically all there is to it. The reasons why floors do not increase is because there are enough players that want to sell or do not perceive the project as worthwhile.  Collectively changing this on both ends will change price."
55,"14/ cont.
This is why you typically need both of these - higher demand and less supply. Just raising the floor in the community doesn't mean anyone outside of it will want it (theoretically)."
56,"13/ Full Circle:
This is where economics comes back into play. Holding is just like decreasing the supply, and strong brand awareness is a way to increase demand.  When both supply decreases and demand increases, price drastically increases. BOOM. Example: BAYC."
57,"12/ cont. 
#HODL accompanied with strong brand awareness is probably the best way to increase the floor price of an NFT project, but it has to be done collectively.  More people unwilling to sell their NFT and outsiders wanting the NFT will increase price!"
58,"11/ cont.
Just by collectively raising the floor does not mean there will be buyers at that price. It could result in less volume. Less volume = less liquidity, less liquidity = harder to sell your NFT. see the next 3 tweets 👇"
59,"10/ Considerations:
As stated, the owners determine the price floor. This is one of the reasons why community is so impactful in the NFT space.  The owners determine the price. A great community will build the project up.  Owners that don’t care won’t."
60,"9/ Example:
This is @fishyfamNFT 7-day volume. As you can see it has been decreasing over the past week. (I love the project and the art so I don’t really care about this, but to new investors, this wouldn’t look great) https://t.co/tfV2p0dsAn"
61,"8/ cont. 
Although this is not the end all be all indicator, it is something to look for.  You can track the volume traded on @LooksRareNFT or @opensea by clicking the tab “Activity” next to the items."
62,"7/ Volume:
This is why the amount traded is always an indicator of how a project is doing.  If not many NFTs in the project are getting sold, more are bound to get listed both decreasing the perceived value and liquidity."
63,"6/ Lowering the Price Floor:
This typically happens when more NFTs are getting listed than sold. Investors who want to pull their money out will sell their NFT at or below the floor just to sell it.  It results in decreased perceived value of the project and lowering the floor."
64,"5/ Raising the Price Floor:
The above is how you organically raise a price floor. The more NFTs being sold than being listed the higher the floor price should go – increasing perceived value. This can also be done by all members of the community listing the NFT for a higher price"
65,"4/ cont. 
For @fishyfamNFT, out of all the owners, the lowest an  owners is willing to sell their NFT for is .2 $ETH.  If this owner delisted or sold the NFT, then the price floor would move up to the next lowest priced NFT in the project.  In this case: .204 $ETH."
66,"3/ Example:
Let’s take 2 extremes: @BoredApeYC and my current favorite @fishyfamNFT 
The current “price floor” is 94 $ETH and .2 $ETH respectively. 
All this really means is that out of all the owners of BAYC the lowest single owner is willing to sell their NFT for is 94 $ETH"
67,"2/ Floor Price in NFTs:
Since there are no laws to determine the minimum price projects/investors can sell their NFT for, Floor Prices work a little differently.  It is not 1 governing body that determines the minimum price, but the owners perceived value of the NFT."
68,"1/ Floor Price in Economics:
Typically, there are laws in place that do not allow certain commodities or goods to fall below a certain price – this would be considered the price floor.  Price floors determined by law have impacts on Supply and Demand."
69,"So I think there is some misunderstanding or lack of knowledge for some on how #floorprice work. I know when I first got into #NFTs I had no clue. 

I am going to explain everything about floor prices and the valuation of NFTs in this 🧵🧵

73,"No new project is going to get anywhere now unless the founders do something unique. Colorful PFPs that don’t add any additional value are unsustainable. The winners already won and are here to stay @BoredApeYC punks, @doodles etc. Create something new, create something different"
74,#dailycrypto 21. We are seeing that $ETH may move to a proof-of-stake method of confirming transactions know as #Ethereum 2.0 instead of what it is currently: proof-of-work.  This should hopefully dramatically reduce both gas prices and the amount of energy.

83,@Devhop They shouldn’t because of gas fees. I really don’t get people sometimes. Can be so irrational.
84,Why don’t we all collectively list our NFTs at a higher price and raise the floors??

87,"#dailycrypto 20. Ethash is the proof-of-work algorithm that is run on the #Ethereum Network. Since this computational problem solving algorithm is very difficult, it requires intensive amounts of energy to run.  This raises significant concerns about environmental sustainability."

92,"13/ Conclusion:
Aside from NFTs, there can be tax benefits to running a business. Typically most creators will have formed a business entity and the tax owed will flow similarly to how I described it. It isn’t very complicated, and most creators have probably considered this."
93,"12/ cont.
Code section 6017 states you must report self-employment income if you make over $400. For most freelancers in the NFT space I would imagine this applies.  The method of calculating the tax is not very different from above. There are some things to look out for though."
94,"11/ The Freelancer: 
The freelancer is typically subject to the self-employment tax which flows similarly to owning an actual business.  There are additional taxes they may encounter different from a typically salaried employee, however."
95,"10/ The Flow:
The above will typically all flow to schedule C which you will attach to your 1040.  This schedule will cover many of the common revenue and expense items you may encounter. Speak with your professional tax advisor if you are unsure."
96,"9/ The Bottom Line:
That net income figure is what will go into your 1040 (individual tax return) and flow through and get taxed on. (Unless the creator decided to form a corporation instead of a flow through entity *that is getting too advanced*) (message me if this is you!)"
97,"8/ Example of an NFT Creator Business:
Sales of NFTs (before taxes in Oct)
Less: advertising expenses (Sept)
Less: running a website expense 
= net income (this is the figure that will get taxed)"
98,"7/ cont.
Now not all these expenses can get run through a business and receive those pretax deductions, but typically internet and other things that are used in your trade or business can qualify for those business deductions. The principle behind it is what matters. Back to NFTs"
99,"6/ cont.
$50,000 in sales at a 20% tax rate but this is business income that you can directly deduct expenses from! 50k – 10k of expenses = 40k x 20% tax = 8k of tax owed meaning you are left with 32k an extra 2k dollars just because you own a business!"
