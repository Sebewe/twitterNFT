Gotta say tho, the @Pixelmon memes are priceless."

9,"@qrowhop All you need is proof, in the smart contract, that the withdrawal goes right to the interested parties and not to the project creators.

Working with her was the BEST choice I could have ever made."
56,Fun fact: There is always an easter egg in everything I code.
57,"@wilxlee @TyNFTstuff This is a great great thread, now check @WeAreDorkis out, and see it doesn't have any of those red flags 👀

80,"@farokh You know, it's funny.. we didn't sellout with @WeAreDorkis at 0.07 mint price, we closed sales at 4724 token minted and worked with what we got from minting.

We keep delivering no matter the amount of ETH earned, and we don't plan on stopping any time soon."

95,"@Loopifyyy Heavily disagree.

My project doesn't give me a stable revenue yet, and a huge share of the earnings from mint are company/community funds. 

If i were to stop minting and ""flipping"", I'd personally end up without money pretty soon 🤷"
