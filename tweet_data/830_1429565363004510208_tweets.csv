@VICE
 #NFTs #NFTCommunity #NFTCommmunity #deadfellaznft #WLTC"
43,NFT's are THE solution for this problem and can give people the stimulation and satisfaction to support the game that they love to play by earning (or buying) unique items giving them the appreciation they deserve for spending much time playing (5/5)
44,"A perfect example of this is Fortnite, you can buy as many skins as you want, but you can never completely own a specific in-game item. (4/5) https://t.co/zYXmBwJVwZ"
45,The current problem with micro-transactions don't give people the satisfaction it should due to the lack of personal ownership of their items and the hard work they put in. (3/5)
46,"P2E gaming is undoubtedly next-up, within the upcoming years gamers will be able to earn passive income with in-game revenue with NFT integration. Once gamers realize if they invest enough time in a game they love, they can earn IRL money, this isn't an issue anymore. (2/5)"
47,"https://t.co/tAa9ci9ueT… News like this always amuses me. This is simply a reaction caused by unfamiliarity with the potential that NFT’s has to offer, an interesting tread! (1/5)"
