53,@chibiapegang @KingBlackBored @boredape2417 @Ape2047 I totally agree… the real issue is no term limits in congress and I would also vote for no term limits in the Supreme Court.. also not a fan of how easy it could be to add justices
54,@chibiapegang @KingBlackBored @boredape2417 @Ape2047 That’s already the system we have… only swing states matter… majority should win because that represents the true voice of the people
55,@chibiapegang @KingBlackBored @boredape2417 @Ape2047 I think Biden sucks too… I think our two party system is a scam.. I believe we need to eliminate the electoral college and go to rank based voting… we need to eliminate political party primaries… check out the forward party… don’t make bullshit assumptions about me
