11,"To inject some bias, I do believe in tech thesis that smart contract platforms will vastly exceed value held in hard money via $BTC.

$ETH at scale absorbs entire financial systems. Bonds, mortgages, trusts etc…

Smart contract platforms enable digitized ownership of everything."
12,"If you believe in the tech thesis you believe the mkt demand for smart contracts exceeds that of hard money.

In this case $ETH becomes more valuable that $BTC.

Assets are priced relative to each other. That means alt L1’s likely follow $ETH since the pie has become much bigger."
13,"$BTC dom is currently 42%. If you believe in the money thesis, you believe that this dominance will continue to stay relevant &amp; high. 

Hard money will be adopted by nations and remain more valuable and in demand than smart contract systems."
14,"For those who prefer hands off, a simple thesis is to view $BTC as hard money and $ETH as banking/custody.

For those who want an active approach, Layer 2 scaling solutions and alt Layer 1’s should be of interest.

15,"Note: Crypto is still far too small for nation state adoption at scale.

ETH + Roll-up’s + Sharding seem to have better tokenomics, security, and performance across the board."
30,"@cryptomeemaw @kevinsekniqi @nateliason @packyM What makes the rest of the iceberg special? Why is a subnet any better than a rollup?

ETH with lower tx cost, greater security, more liquidity &amp; more devs seems scary.
