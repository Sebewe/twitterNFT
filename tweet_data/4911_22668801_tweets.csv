19,@creepztopia With all due respect. It seems you  left the discord because people asked you why you were responding to questions over a month old and you may have misinterpreted them trying to roast you. My DM’s are always open if you want to chat.

27,@MitcheIl Yeah judging by that voice memo… why ever take on a project if you can’t even handle running one? Makes zero sense at all
28,@MitcheIl Gotcha that makes A LOT more sense. 70k is peanuts to fund any community initiative.
