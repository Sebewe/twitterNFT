""When I play, I play to shift the way I feel and connect with others."" - Keira Wings

May my music do the same for you. #WoWWiM https://t.co/Xz5n6ee0Fu"
71,"Some ask, how does Keira Wings make the hypnotic, tranquil, meditative, mystical sound that she is known for? Introducing the Rav drum, a.k.a. space drum or UFO drum. Rituals before performing help too. Bird watching puts me in the optimum state. #WoWWiM https://t.co/EGMZTX3Q8o"

Ship sirens, a roadsweeper clearing fallen leaves, he's limping, the drip-drop of rain... a random bark from a stranger dog. I was sure my music would get me out of homelessness. And I was right. #WoWWiM https://t.co/niuHueZCXd"
