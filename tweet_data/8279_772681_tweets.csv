29,@Stammy Related the 401k was managed by Fidelity. I first did the conversion within Fidelity to limit transfer/market delays. After the conversion I was then able to move the equities 1-1 to my Schwab account without delays. Going directly from Fidelity 401k to Schwab was more cumbersome
30,@Stammy After leaving my last company I learned that I could transfer my 401k to a traditional IRA. I did this both for access to more investment options as well as reduced the exorbitant fund and custodial fees charged by the 401k plan. Worth looking into if you haven't already.
