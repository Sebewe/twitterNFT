1,@johnwas94054624 @jonasauruz @CNBC @Fidelity Unless you use a protocol that lets you borrow using your NFTs as collateral.. you’re still going to have taxable events when you sell said NFTs for crypto BEFORE using a loan protocol. Your point (as presented) is irrelevant.

14,@FalkoGraupner @olya_borderless Are you a fucking moron? Because that’s what one would assume by this horrendous take. Pretty easy to tell you don’t live in a country that’s being invaded.
