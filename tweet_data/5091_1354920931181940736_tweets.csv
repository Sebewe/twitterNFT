1,@AndieNft @CanineCartelNFT Wow congrats!
2,@JaxsonZara @dj_rstar This person is a scammer
3,"Stay vigilant friends. Oh, and here's a list of everyone else who i messaged so you can check out their accounts for red flags. There's even more if you check who all reacted to this tweet: https://t.co/ZsKR8DcjQX https://t.co/BF9jms68Qn"
4,"Thankfully, I ended the situation with a laugh and no lost money. But truth be told, I got lucky. If the other scammers didn't all cannibalize Emily's con I really might have fell for it. I'm happy to have learned this lesson the easy way and am sharing so you all can too."
5,'She' even sent me a video flipping the image like a card so i could see how legit it was. You really can't make this stuff up. https://t.co/bH5JOyuV8d
6,SHE SENT ME THIS 🤣 — she quite literally pulled the 2d image from above into blender and tried to pass it off as a 3d model. https://t.co/FYiDPWEKa1
7,"At this point I knew she was a scammer, but I had to see what would happen. https://t.co/VaXY9XV2TL"
8,So now i asked Emily to provide me an instagram. I checked it out and it seemed very obvious that she had not made any of the art on it. So i asked her to simply provide me with a screenshot of one of her 3d models in blender so i could see she actually built it.
9,It was immediately clear they were all scammers. None could provide portfolios or links to their work. only photos. mostly watermarked. two even provided the SAME art as 'theirs'. https://t.co/9YJHgPdAe8
10,but theennnn i woke up the next morning and something fishy had happened. 7 (and counting) other accounts with pretty girls in their PFPs and similar bios had messaged me in similar ways. Things are getting fishy. I start messaging them to see whats up.
11,I explained the work i needed and she graciously provided some references. And she was very eager to start on the work promising a quick turnaround. https://t.co/wsWeVrABZO
12,I first posted a tweet looking for 3D artists and Emily below was kind enough to respond. https://t.co/DVr65fVDEc
13,"Look out for scammers everyone, here's a short thread/fun story..."
14,You guys try listening to a Gary Vee podcast lately? Shit is fire.

18,"RT @andycyberfrog: This makes my 🍆 hard 😂 

The new @CyberFrogsNFT branding is about to raise the bar 💪 https://t.co/Z9b92OTjI7"
19,@SimonJohnStuart Yeah that’s interesting. Do you think it would be possible in today’s hype-driven markets to just mint them and let people buy them from opensea ? Some way for them to be revealed before mint makes sense to me too now
20,@itstylersays I would respectfully disagree. Those people were promised something and it wasn’t delivered on. This weakens trust in the team to deliver on everything else. And they’re holding stock in this team to deliver on a lot more than just art so there’s cause for concern.
21,@burnpile_eth How does that work?
22,Maybe we shouldn’t do mints anymore. Is there another way to launch a collection?

74,I don’t like the idea that someone is going to claim to be minting colours on the blockchain to own. I hope it will be well understood that buying one of those does not mean you own anything. If there was ever an nft that can be right click saved it’s these.
75,What do you guys think of GaryVee's podcast? I LOVE it
