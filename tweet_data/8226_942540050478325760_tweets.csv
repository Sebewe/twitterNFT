20,As a latina that has worked in the sports industry and the crypto space I have experienced myself the challenges. It’s a slow process but an important one and one I wanna be a part of.
21,"I listened to @betty_nft last week during a twitter spaces talking about the need for more inclusivity in the NFT space and the ongoing need to break barriers to entering male dominated industry by BIPOC, LGBTQ+  and women."

39,"Great to see @adidasoriginals in the JPmorgan report. With #bayc Indigo Herz and the tracksuit.

65,@CacheClouds @kanyewest Let’s see .  I am have a feeling it will be a music NFT first.
66,@Pasta_Paccheri Connecting with people doing the work.
67,@JHNC @benmayorwhite @kanyewest What do you think the chances are ?

72,The type of ideas I wanna see. 👀 https://t.co/R4T4WRrryD
73,@ljin18 Creator and user owned is the way 🤝
74,"While I am a blockchain supporter, I hold in tension the belief that it can equally create an even deeper digital panopticon. Technology is a tool and it will depend on us how it’s used."
75,@blader @garrytan I would argue the builder needs to find both the right problem to solve and then second in the right way.  A builder is also a leader - in agreement with your sentiment.
76,@ljin18 Actually high- res digital fashion might find its home in an unexpected area first . AR glasses allowing to make visible digital products will be a big area as an AR visualization of the NFTs perhaps even before than in land.
77,@ljin18 But already all lands are running forward with their own solutions. The big idea to then watch is parametric garment design/ that accommodates to all avatar bodyshapes. This is my wheel house - makes me happy to see progress and innovation here.
78,@ljin18 We are early for high-res fashion with in world utility. Currently is either low poly/voxelized. We will see more iterations of pfps+wearables that come with 2D+3D assets. A sort of avatar standardization would be needed for compatibility and composabilty.
79,@haroldr86 @benmayorwhite 😁!  I am glad you noticed
80,"@benmayorwhite Uh oh… let’s create a dao, buy land and create an IRL community."
81,Made this digital t-shirt but maybe it would be a fun one to get done IRL.  @benmayorwhite what do you think? #digitalfashion https://t.co/O1aAFPLUbm
82,"These are just some initial thoughts. It all comes down to the Strenght of the Dao, the diversity of thought, background of members as well as their knowledge and experience."
83,"3.A new way to create product -&gt; true co-creation

A close relationship between user and company creating product. Open door creation, live with fast iteration of product - community voting for new features."
84,"https://t.co/dkIDHJ01Pk effects 

Once you have a community of owners on board, not only there is passion, there is pride. Founders will essentially have marketing embedded as part of funding - you will have a large group of people talking about the product to others."
85,"1.Power in numbers 

Digital communities could become the core initial power users of the products being created and provide clear, fast and diverse feedback to founders."
86,A a couple early projections on the power of investment Daos vs traditional VC  🧵
87,"Imagine saying in the future that the only people who used to be allowed to invest in certain asset classes had to earn minimum $200k year/&gt;$1m net worth. Regulation has to change, the future needs to be built by many more."
88,blockchain lowers barriers to investment. It won’t happen overnight and also many folks don’t have investment knowledge. Traditional VCs have an advantage over current investment DAOs. I am very bullish though on the passion and power of online communities💪

98,"The most radical form of emancipation and steps towards individual sovereignty is the creation of your own individual token and currency. 

Web3 enables this."
99,"@WayRay Yea , I see headsets as a vehicle towards a larger vision along with mocap suits, gloves and shoes. We will find good solutions through iteration and perhaps different use cases will require new hardware.  Brain to internet connection being the last frontier"
