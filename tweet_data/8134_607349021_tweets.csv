24,"@DVL_eth @CakedApes I’m digging that one you’re rocking also, what is that?"
25,"@RasTerms Neat as the whole generative thing is, seeing what gets algorithmically “born” it’s pretty corporatised. Great community can still be built upon them though and I have respect for the people completing processes required for creating an admirable generative project."
26,"@RasTerms &amp; It’s interesting, an elderly woman I worked for recently told me that her art professor at stanford back in 1969 said that her idea for some home decor print was too utilitarian. Now with many NFTs utility is part of the allure."
27,@RasTerms Genuinely Love your street art almost more than anything. Graffiti against the system and you are two that will be in history books.
28,I Love my @PeacefulToadz ! Two of my favourite projects combined. Doesn’t get “mush” better than this!! 🍄 ❤️ 🐸 ✌🏽 https://t.co/I1tx984p9V

30,"@RasTerms Little bit of everything I believe, I personally wanted to flip the original piece I bought from you so I could buy your mushroom piece. Some people need money, it’s not that they don’t appreciate the art. Some are flippers with no soul. In my opinion"
