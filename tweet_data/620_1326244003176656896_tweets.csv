23,@AdamantiumNFT @BlueBadger2600 there will be exceptions always of course
24,"@AdamantiumNFT @BlueBadger2600 think the difference is how the meme is spawned in ct that decides success
an established history in web2 ie pepe,wojak,Are ya winning son? helps longterm success if the right community unlocks it
Vs a web3 ct trending joke of the day like pickles, whales, kevins (tbd) https://t.co/9zAdx8Qfuj"
25,"@BlueBadger2600 I would like to add the mfercreator is not the creator of the mfer meme itself, he just used it and capitalized for everyones benefit

The meme had the power, he unlocked it so to speak

But if it was not a meme prior i think it wouldn’t work"
26,@amiller325gd @BoredApeYC 🙉
27,"@BlueBadger2600 but the mfers is a great example, where a great vision/team/community plus the power of meme, can take off tremendously

55,@NFTmachine If it does its not a big thing thats for sure
56,"Dawns on me only 10,000 apes and you cannot buy fractions of an ape, at least not in a practical way.

The implication of this and the massive delist we just saw could be epic
