23,"@bloccchange Correct, its net proceeds. Profits minus losses. I don't think there is a way they can link you to a metamask wallet. So, realistically you're safe if you don't claim gains while you degen using a metamask wallet but you're legally obligated to claim them if that makes sense."
24,"@bloccchange Legally, I'm pretty sure you always need to claim gains. Maybe the 1099-K is different, idk."
25,"@bloccchange NFA. You're supposed to report any gains/losses. Now, I don't think there is any way to tell that your degen metamask wallet belongs to you. No KYC yet. I do wonder how to report cost basis when you do swap to USD though."
