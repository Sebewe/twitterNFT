63,"@fugazi0x @huckleberrygump My guess is that Coinbase won't go that route because it will definitely upset their stakeholders, and Openseas reputation suggests that they won't be reacting until it's too late.. with all being said there is so much work for #LooksRare to do if they wanna compete with giants"
64,"@huckleberrygump Only thing I can say now is that I think they had no choice, they HAD to roll out the marketplace before Coinbase does to take a decent market share from Opensea before a well established trademark come in to business, they can improve with time and feedbacks from community"
65,"@huckleberrygump $Ens did the job perfectly, well before the issuing the token and nothing changed with the token. And I was actually wanted to write a thread about why they rushed the marketplace and I'll forward it here too"
