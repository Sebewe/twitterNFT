13,Ok I’ve finally pulled the trigger for @CAMEOPASS. Not just a regular one but the GM one by @burnttoast.  The pass itself is undervalued imo. I trust @Mr312 and the @BookCameo business behind. LFG! https://t.co/mbQjI4EWe3
14,Product manager being a product manager for a product that he is not in charge. Thank you for attending my TED talk.
15,"A clean UX could be an explanation of why this message did not went through and guide you to add recipient as friend. However, a better solution would be to let me message that recipient cause I only wanted not to RECIEVE a DM, this should not block me to SEND a DM if I can."
16,It's a discord UX bug. The main reason is; sender's DMs are closed so it does not let you chat with any user who is not your friend. But in the message it gives you wrong info and keeps you in dark. The only solution for sender is to turn DMs on or add recipient as friend.
17,"&lt;This is usually because you don't share a server with the recipient or the recipient is only accepting direct messages from friends&gt; it says. But the recipient DMs are open, and we're in the same server... So how?"
18,"If you turn your DMs off, and try to send a DM to a user on discord with DMs open, discord gives you this error. https://t.co/K41Y9TKIPf"
19,"Many of you are familiar with @discord DM scams so most of us turn DMs off in many servers. Mine is open, just for everyone in our project @polarbearsnft to reach me when they want. But even my DMs open, sometimes I'm pinged that they were not able to DM me. Why that happens? 🧵 https://t.co/8fJwDHRDMy"
20,We’ve been talking around this topic a lot lately with @dotyigit and this is gonna be one of the main reasons we’ll be doing the Fluffy Movement at @polarbearsnft. Non-dilutive extendable NFTs on single contract  are the future of this space. https://t.co/RMHkX8vLlS

29,"To sum up, buy a cold wallet, keep your precious nfts in it and do not connect that cold wallet anywhere if possible. Use hot wallet for raffles, minting and day-trades. When you're done, transfer your coins &amp; nfts to cold wallet and sleep better at night."
30,"Of course connecting your cold wallet to trusted sites should be reasonable. Like collab land or opensea etc. But as we've seen yesterday, this might have unexpected outcomes. You never know."
31,"Mint, go shopping with a burner hot wallet and then transfer it to cold wallet to keep it safe. It might cost a little but this is safer. When you want to sell sth from the cold wallet, open a new burner hot wallet transfer it there and list from there. This is maximum security."
32,"Threat your hard wallet like a steel safe at home. You don't go shopping with your safe right? We use pocket wallets, which is our hot wallets in blockchain. Keep your forever assets in cold wallet and if possible do not connect it to any site. Do not mint with your hard wallet."
33,"Hard wallet in the end contains a wallet address, and if you sign a transaction that gives control of your wallet or your assets in it, whether it's hot or cold wallet doesn't matter, the control is in someone else's hand in blockchain. So what should we do?"
34,"If you threat your hard wallet like primary address and go mint, enter raffle, connect many sites with it, that means you are open to any vulnerability just like your hot wallet. Simple reason is that when you sign a malicious transaction with your hard wallet, GG."
35,One of the biggest misunderstandings of hard wallet is once your NFTs are in there they are totally safe. It's wrong and here is why 🧵
