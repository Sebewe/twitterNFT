1,"@SmolBrainsNFT If I may, people still ‘fading’ on smol bodies. Insanely undervalued considering they have the same functions (plates vs IQ), and considering there’s only 56 smol bodies listed, very good chance bodies catch up (maybe even flip) brains. But we all frens ok! @SmolBodies"

Will probably see his less famous sibling @garyvee follow in his footsteps.  Typical if you ask me.

25,@Bmoreblockchain @ShogunWarNFT Oh didn't know that.  I sold my Realm today.  There was too much vagueness surrounding treasure partnership.  Will buy back in when its cleared up.
26,@Bmoreblockchain @ShogunWarNFT Great perspective.  Did you notice that dev royalties are 0%?
27,"@BattleFlyGame If this project is a target…it makes me even more bullish.  Hopefully no one fell for it. If you did, DM me and maybe I can send you something."
28,"@Anonn_eth @ShogunWarNFT Agreed, I let the tunes play for a while before i minted.  Great job @ShogunWarNFT
