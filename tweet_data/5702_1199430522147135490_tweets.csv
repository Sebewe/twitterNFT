Here ya go fellow Kong"
2,@_miketriumph_ @RumbleKongs Ya once you get to the higher boosts + pros the floors aren’t real indicative of what you could sell for. There’s a Dune dashboard that you can search by min/max total boost and find recent sales that way. The Kong marketplace is going to be awesome

6,@crookedwest Thanks friend!
7,@JefferyTezos @RandyL_NFTs All of the boost stuff is a bit of speculation right now  because no one really knows what the appropriate premium for a given boost threshold will be. But in general I agree. @TheKongTracker shared this in the discord yesterday and just under 50% of Kongs have 200+ boosts https://t.co/bgmzjoiaYL
8,"@RandyL_NFTs haven't included 200's in these because they usually are just above floor, but 200 floor is 2.29 right now with 31 listed.
