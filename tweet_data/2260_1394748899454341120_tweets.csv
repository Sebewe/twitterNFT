74,@TryFlight Very comfy bag.
75,"You need 4 pets for a full team. 
Genesis pets have unlimited breeding. 

If you only have 1 pet you can:

Rent a pet to make them breed giving you one more pet. 

Breed that pet twice with your genesis. 

You now have 4 to send on quests and aquire pixl."
76,@steveb_crypto The ol pilk shuffle
77,@LfishermanNFT You could sell 1 gold and 3 commons. That’s kind of alot tho. Could be worth it.
78,@ilovelazylions https://t.co/93pPrNsrgY
79,@rug_maxi Always need more. MORE!
80,@LfishermanNFT What are all your pet rarities?
81,@Akkukap It is very tempting
82,@nft_d3gen Get some pets 😂. Depends on how you’re approaching the pixlverse
83,@steveb_crypto I wish I could add 😔
84,@LfishermanNFT I would sell some pets for a seal so you can generate pixl automatically. You could argue you won’t need a seal because you can send ur pets on quests for pixl but it would be better (imo) to generate at least 50 pixl daily.
85,@FlippyFlapperz NERD!
86,@steveb_crypto Super winning
87,RT @jacobshedevrs: @SlippySlapperz i have 1 seal 3 pets 1 founders pass and 2 massive balls
88,@jacobshedevrs Nice balls yo.
89,"@Akkukap 2 more pets throw the rest in pixl. Sell the pixl for a seal (hopefully) when pixl hits roughly .30. 

U need 2 more pets to have a full team so you will never have to rent. You could also argue buy 1 seal and breed the 2 pets u have to fill your team."
90,@Akkukap Are you playing the game or flipping?
91,@WilliamWonka24 It be like that

94,@Akkukap Immediate profit once game is live
95,1 seal and 2 genesis pixl pets will get you right.
96,@bugs3023 If you’re going for the deity’s. Which I am not due to the high risk high reward.
97,"Good pixlverse bags:
1 seal 2 pets
2 seals 4 pets
4 seals 8 pets + founders pass

I base this on speculation."
