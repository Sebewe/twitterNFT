Can't pretend this is 2003 with iraq/afghanistan.

6,"@paul_arnold @micsolana @balajis my point: tons of Russian civilians probably don't support putins action either, but their savings are collateral damage..

Imagine if the world sanctioned America because of Trumps actions - would we be ok to sit and accept that ""well, this is just collateral, sucks to suck""?"

17,"@micsolana The part where i'm not sure I agree is the framing that, economic sanctions isn't backing putin into a desperate corner that could result in nukes. they are intense and I find myself aligning with @balajis perspective ""nuked them economically"" - all 145 M

45,"If you want to run a project, think about it in a 5-10 year horizon instead.

No amount of money can bring you peace, security, and freedom. It can help, but only to an extent.

65,RT @ThaLastDJ: An absolute must read on the psychology of nfts and why I will never question the “staying power” of this space. 👏
66,RT @12GLepage: Another great thread from atareh. A must read.
67,"47/ So the next time someone asks why NFTs are worth so much, send them this thread - NFTs are so much more than just JPEGs. 

They're something that help people fulfil their core emotional and human needs in so many ways, and it’s hard to put a price on that."
68,"46/ In NFTs, we found belonging and community.

We found connection when so many of us were deprived of it - which, at the end of the day, is really what it means to be human.

Without each other to share experiences with, life is empty."
69,45/ What nobody could have predicted was that NFTs would change so many lives by offering financial security and the freedom to live life on their own terms.
70,"44/ Fundamentally, humans have a craving and desire to want to feel safe, belong, and to feel important.

In 2021, in an unstable period in history, many of us found that in NFT communities"
71,"43/ But through a psychologists lens, it's evident that NFTs aren't only about money, ego (cc: @guardianartbot) and they certainly aren't just JPEGs https://t.co/phy7rZIzYU"
72,"42/ Round off Maslow's pyramid, the last level is ""self-actualization""

In Maslow's perspective, that is the peak state that any human can reach.

What ""peak state"" actually is looks different for everyone, so it's not my place to give examples here https://t.co/aRdDpcdY85"
73,"41/ and of course, this is where @foreverapesnft fits into this

we're creating luxury physicals for BAYC and the wider NFT community, starting with a high-quality coffee table book

https://t.co/qFybzbLzdo"
74,"40/ Or the apple watch + Bored Ape combo which is becoming notorious

https://t.co/Ua4Dtsgayy"
75,"39/ But we've seen other forms of IRL status signaling, particularly with BAYC. 

Like this BAYC Rolex watch https://t.co/JvlSzU0jFK"
76,"38/ Esteem needs are also where status comes into play. 

I’ve written about pfps becoming status symbols on Twitter, which is a big part of the value of @boredapeyc

https://t.co/Djk7HPQTo5"
77,"37/ How people channelled their creativity was unique to them:

some built valuable tools for the community (@niftytailor), some created banners (@nftgerry), and others built a totally new universe like Jenkins

https://t.co/fHDAXxQEuI"
78,"36/ Naturally, BAYC creators have spent more time in thriving mode vs survival mode

When money isn't a concern, your brain switches from survival, fear-based emotions (i.e. risk-averse) to putting yourself out there, taking chances and building https://t.co/EriixMhtMY"
79,"35/ @boredapeyc was the first NFT project with a high floor. 

BAYC members experienced the safety to go full-time in NFTs first.

Even though cryptopunks was the most valuable at the time, these were inaccessible to most people by early 2021

https://t.co/f5y5GbYTLp"
80,"34/ Esteem needs are all about mastery, achieving something, and gaining status and respect among people.

With this lens, it makes complete sense why we see so many creators coming from BAYC specifically (and not as many from cool cats, doodles etc)"
81,"33/ and with that safety blanket, many quit their jobs to go full time into NFTs.

Your ability to pay your rent was no longer tied to you working a 9-5, freeing up your time to explore your creativity.

and with that, level 4 in Maslow's pyramid was unlocked: Esteem https://t.co/8lLKJRYhky"
82,"32/ Then, NFTs solved people's ""safety"" needs in a big way

The ape you had purchased for ~$600 was now worth $50K only a few months later

While that isn't necessarily ""life-changing"" in a grand way, it did give people a safety blanket they didn't have before."
83,"31/ So, NFTs and communities solved people's love/belonging needs that weren't being met due to pandemic restrictions."
84,"30/ At a time when people needed connection and belonging the most, here came these funny apes making monkey sounds in Clubhouse rooms https://t.co/ZAfujJg6fd"
85,"29/ pfp NFTs projects like @boredapeyc helped people feel like a part of a group, a collective.

In the middle of isolation and lockdowns, you had a group of people that you could connect with digitally on Twitter, Discord and Clubhouse/Spaces"
86,"28/ and that energy - the human desire to connect with others, to feel like a part of a group which was missing from so many people's day to day lives - parlayed right into pfp NFTs"
87,"27/ For the first time in a long time, you were able to connect and talk to people with shared interests, like you would IRL"
88,"26/ Collectively, we all yearned for the human connection we were used to, pre-lockdown.

When we could hang out with friends, go on dates and meet new people.

It's not a coincidence that Clubhouse took the world by storm around this time https://t.co/oloSXEZHyc"
89,"25/ Chaos can shake your foundation

If you lose your job because of lockdowns, your safety needs are at risk - can you still pay rent?

and if you're unable to see family or lived alone during lockdown, your love and belonging needs weren't being met"
90,"24/ and we're back

most of us degens are likely at the ""love and belonging"" stage in Maslow's hierarchy - we're much well of than the majority of the world

But in 2021, with the lockdowns and not being able to see loved ones, lost jobs, the world was chaotic, to say the least https://t.co/vygCH0wDfj"
91,https://t.co/TStgWzdB45
92,"23/ Hey, 23 tweets in... meme break anyone? https://t.co/po27dGE2HA"
93,"22/ it's fair to say that most of us degens on apeing into NFTs have our physiological + safety needs met at the very least.

Like, nobody sacrificed dinner so they could mint @pixelmon's

...right? https://t.co/z7IuveTWpj"
94,"21/ and of course, nothing in life is linear. 

So you can go from a higher level on Maslow's pyramid, back down to a lower level when hardships hit, like divorce, losing a job, or war 💙💛"
95,"20/ Now, the theory states that to ""level up"" in life, you need to meet the needs of the previous level

As in, you won't care about love and belonging if you don't have enough food to eat

It's why the theory is best visualized as a pyramid. Something each of us climbs up https://t.co/RepiIhQCVO"
96,"19/ 

4) Esteem: Esteem for one-self through achievement and gaining respect from others (status, prestige)

5) Self-actualization: The highest level on the pyramid, it's the realization of a person's full potential, to seek growth and become all that you can be"
97,"18/ The 5 core needs are as follows:

1) Physiological: basic survival needs like food, shelter

2) Safety: Having order, predictability, and emotional and financial security

3) Love and belongingness: friendship, intimacy, trust with others and a group"
98,"17/ To explain, allow me to introduce our friend Abraham Maslow, a 20th century Psychologist.

Best known for his theory called ""Maslow's hierarchy of needs"" which states that every human has 5 core needs https://t.co/R6MSLzmDfb"
99,"16/ This story is more common than you'd think, not just for BAYC members but for people that have done well with NFTs overall

Life has changed for so many with NFTs - but it's not just about money in the bank.

There is a deep psychological change that has happened"
