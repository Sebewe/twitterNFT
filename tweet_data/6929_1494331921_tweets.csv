1,"@RonanHunt88 @SirWilliamEth you may want to claim and sit on it for over a year to get in that long term gains bracket for when you sell.  not tax advice, no one knows still i think. but the magical one year hold period is fairly common."
2,"@GratefulApe_eth @BYOPills i have seen some big twitter names praising these projects for weeks, thats a good sign. can i ask, is the land for an existing metaverse? or are they building out their own metaverse amd selling land for that?"
3,"@Aelio33 but to be clear, its not just cost that will bring players in. 

successful worlds need a creative idea and a team (or person) that can execute."
4,@Aelio33 i think itd be quite cheap. a playable phase 1 of a world for under $25K of work cost?
5,@GraffirapNFT @MarioJerel @JUSTDOITDAD1 @BYOPills @Worldwide_WEB3 @nftworldsNFT How many people could play simultaneously?
6,@RonnyCox4 @psychedelic_nft @TheLazyBandit @LaziestLazyLion very cool!
7,"@Stoniphantom all this NFT World metaverse hype is great and all, but give me a bayc or gcg to play as"
8,@stefanmeier3000 @edwardallerton @HeartNFTs @AidanCullen2 that was very well done! https://t.co/t4bu07rV6D
9,"@anthonya @osf_nft @darran0x @Sothebys Yep, mostly from 2017 purchases."
10,"@ivandashkov @PUMA From a famous feline to a famous feline company, welcome!"
11,"@dkm14 in addition to profile pictures, NFTs can also encompass beautiful original pieces of art. @vintagemozart https://t.co/IplvAuQ9E8"
12,@cryptjoe9 all we have to do is speak with out eth and they will.
13,"@xBenJamminx this is what i tell people first and foremost about NFTs. they are straight up fun to collect and show off compared to stocks/coins, which have their own benefits dont get me wrong. always a solid strategy to invest in things you use and believe in."
14,@skuxxverse @nftworldsNFT So does this mean each skuxxverse holder will get ~100 $wrld in 10 days or so when the next big air drop of 250 million $wld tokens are given to world holders?
15,Ughh.. clumsy me. I dropped my coffee. Hows everyone else's morning going?  @GutterCatGang https://t.co/9o8KCgHEQo
16,"@ArtHouseGarbage @MGkrypt @LeonidasNFT did the devs really update a portion of the metadata post launch?  if so, thats on a level akin to crypto chicks tracing the art. that would be very dirty and anyone involved with that knowledge should be ashamed."
17,@LottoLimpy oh man this is fun. i'm down.
18,"@Im_ThomasJ @nftavs @NFTCryptoChicks cmon man... ""inspired""?  its a literal trace. i am just surprised this didnt come to light sooner."

25,"@FinnNFT @GutterCatGang After passing at mint, I am glad I recently jumped in. You wont regret it!"
26,@MolishAndrew @HeartNFTs a better heart when btc is above $50K but it'll do https://t.co/dmKkgpa8ED
27,@OgboOkoronkwo congrats!
28,"@stevedepino @HeartNFTs why not, i'm down"
29,@ShrewdCharlie youre a smart ape. this is the way. totally agree.
30,"@0xAllen_ @just1n_eth my thoughts are who cares? if someone wants to pay that, have fun! i personally think there are a billion better opps for your eth, but someone else may not believe so. a person should just mute it from their timeline if it really bothers them."
31,@Benadryll_ @lukedidriksen @GutterCatGang @gutterikarlee @guttervikkita @ClamzEth yes sir! https://t.co/v8ARmhzBrk
32,"@CryptoMcDreamy yep, but it still bums me out knowing there are tons of people who lost their butts in January on subpar projects."
33,@ArtificialSham1 @louachu2 @ArtHouseGarbage same.  the apes/punks/gutter window was sort of the magical beginning to all of this for me.  i do have to say it was nice to only have a few major projects going on then.
34,@Stoniphantom @YatMuseum got someone below who is onboard https://t.co/zYGd6EE5Sd
35,"@LooksRareNFT @achimh That is awesome to hear.  If you guys add the ability to list down to the hour (instead of a 1 day minimum), I wouldn't ever have to go to OpenSea again."
36,@CryptoNFTs @garyvee What we needed this week. What a great response.
37,@liloldhead sounds interesting!  all it takes is 1 project to do this well and it could rub off on other projects rather quickly.
38,@ApeStackin @CountofZurich @nftworldsNFT i think bayc prices have $ape factored in but i hear ya. we dont know details yet.
39,"Sold my bored ape for $8K.

Bought a bored ape kennel dog for over $25K.

40,@Stoniphantom @GutterCatGang What does that mean?  Can't anybody put the cat emoji in their twitter profile or is this something else?  ganggang
41,@brickwahl_NFT @BlazedCats super nintendo. good choice
42,"@Ckanipe1 @HeartNFTs those will look nice next to each other in his wallet, good combo!"
43,@gutterikarlee one of the more sophisticated looking cats i have come across.
44,@HaydenWinks This is great!  So what are the main takeaways?  Do i dare say that drafting a QB before round 5 in season-long scenarios may start to become more common?
45,@Ckanipe1 @djkhaled @HeartNFTs had to grab another too.  so excited on whats to come. https://t.co/DCisBgGtxG
46,"@usonstudios @MetaMask exactly, i was hoping to take advantage while gas was low!

the good news is all my transactions eventually went through without me having to manually set a nonce."
47,"@usonstudios @MetaMask mine is bad in the last hour. lots of trans stuck in pending. etherscan shows dropped and then success, but metamask not updating. argh."
48,"@GutterBars So many cool, more rare cats in this thread but if the hippie shirt with joint combo is what fits, let me know. https://t.co/6PjhDft472"

50,"@iSocialFanz @FUCKINGRUG @NFT365podcast @BlazedCats The day i update my twitter pfp! 6 months, really?!"
51,@MrStats_ ape follow ape was old last July.
52,"@ABigThingBadly @NFTbark @stonercatstv i believe @BlazedCats will flip @stonercatstv soon. Stoner Cats had a high mint price and Blazed Cats was spun off as a parody project in  just 24 hours. Just a straight up knock on corporate greed.  Oh, and Blazed Cats continues to be one of the more charitable projects to boot."
53,"@FUCKINGRUG @BlazedCats The project will have it's day, just wait. https://t.co/P2YQktFFfc"
54,"@hypebeastcrypto @GutterCatGang @Stoniphantom @gutterdan_ @gutterbt @gutterric @gutterikarlee @GutterMitch people will start to realize that the OGs last june were punks, apes and gutter cats!  oh and meebits but they dont count. https://t.co/N0wZIIT9zO"
55,@MikeInfarinato @FlowerGirlsNFT @VarvaraAlay Cross pollination starts this month in Feb.  Excited! https://t.co/l7O4IL9Fvc
56,"@Moocowsrcute @zr0art @GutterCatGang we got similar cats, love it! https://t.co/V6bOLZG1gK"
57,@ironkodiak @RonanMcGrath @joeieraci @kylebloemers @darrenrovell If you put $10K on the Bengals at that same time the payout would have been far less than $200K.  Probably in the $130K range. Vegas likes to make money in the middle.
58,"@imastonefox @FrostyxNugz @W1ll1amEth @Cosmo_886 @opensea @BoredApeYC that would be awesome, but would cost more gas i'd imagine."
59,"BAYC, Meebits, Gutter Cats, Cool Cats, Pudgy Penguins, Lazy Lions, Cyber Kongz, Doodles"
60,"For those new(er) to the NFT space, does the age of a project come into play when buying?  Fun quiz, order this alphabetized list from oldest to newest mint date. (Answer is in comments)

63,"@KylTrmbl @MrTravisBennett embrace it my friend, open your mind. and for just $495 i will make your twitter picture into an NFT.  heck, i then may even let you buy it from me for the right price."
64,"@thewonkypenguin @GymBeast1998 @TomPelissero every NFL team has 3 units and SF's def and special teams were magnificent. simple as that. what a great game, i gave SF no chance before the blocked punt."
65,@BalouBAYC @xBenJamminx came here to say that. hopefully twitter adds this ability without twitter blue
66,@MelissaRowley @vintagemozart @worldofwomennft beautiful!  i grabbed one of vintagemozarts pieces last summer and have no regrets. https://t.co/nGDNxRULrV
67,@JeffKCollins congrats!  hope youre right.  i still think lamelos official nft project is flying under the radar too.
68,"@corporatetrash1 there are some nice values there too.  i know that'll be short lived, but i check there first before OS. took some time to break the OS habit."

76,"@Dave__P_ @UltraLord97 its his 2nd top shot ever, and much more affordable than his 1st.  its very undervalued imo"
77,@Q24_NFT @Loopifyyy takes about $5 million (up to $50 million+) and a few years to make a good original game. even then there are flops. but i'm glad the NFT project you bought has it on their Q2 roadmap lol.

86,@SaysAdam @LazyLionsNFT been born ready https://t.co/TrN8VYq4WR
87,@JoshiQ @AwesemoDFS yeah i feel this is the pretty simple solution. they have to declare who they are dressing X minutes before tip off. nba has gotta step in because this X minute rule has huge repercussions on gambling and therefore viewership. what am i missing?
88,@GrittyFefe @curvethots good advice. this specific contract has been reviewed by quite a few smart people so its all right. but you can still disconnect your metamask after claiming.
