36,@goodmontheth 💎👐?
37,"@oak_arrow Oh wow! Thank you Oak. Very different than what I usually paint, but the war has me so damned upset. ❤️‍🔥"
38,@betty_nft Looooooool!
39,"@die__lala Or at least my negative emotions. But, you make me think sadness, fear, melancholy, and angry may not be ""ugly"", but human and to be human is beautiful.  Thank you. ❤️‍🔥"
40,@die__lala Thank you! I try not to focus on the negative emotions in my art as I always want my work to uplift the mood of the viewer. I think that is why I called it ugly. But your perspective is so true. Maybe my own mind being is critical of my emotions and therefore I label myself ugly.
41,@PalomarRo Love this!! Thank you.
42,@PalomarRo This is exciting!!! I can't wait to see what it becomes! 🌸🔥
43,@PalomarRo @SuperRare Opps. I didn't realize this is just for SR artists. I thought you were opening this up to all women for your sharing this month. I apologize I am not a SR artist. I hadn't applied.
44,"@PalomarRo @SuperRare I am an oil painter turned digital painter after I had my kids. My work sells around 1.5-2Ξ. I practice scarictiy I haven't to applied to SuperRare, but if you think you or other curators would like my work I will apply. The first is my newest about the war. It's called Fractūra. https://t.co/AUDwXPBV18"
45,@PalomarRo That's amazing! I am a female artist and  founder of @MetaverseQueens that has lots of amazing artists that are women. I definitely don't want to shill on your Twitter so let me know if there is anyway yo submit art for your review. Thank you for doing this!!

51,@aarngiri @WoodiesNFT @Deadfellaz It is!!!
52,Very talented 17-year-old artist from India. https://t.co/PqUWICoF4O
53,"@aarngiri Oh, I love the colors on these!!! Goregous."
54,@betty_nft Oh!  My!  I would be curious what that threshold is.  Must be how celebrities feel.
55,@chelseaevenstar Oh wow! Thank you. It is certainly the way the world is making me feel.  I am glad it resonated.
56,Projects I still love: @WoodiesNFT and @Deadfellaz because they are not cash grabs and are transcending other 10ks in terms of their value proposition.
57,"So I think we collectively decided no more cash grabs, yes?  So I want to hear about what you are selling or buying.  Please post photos and links so I can check it out.  I'm looking to see 1/1's or small editions by artists.  No generatives unless it is a proven team."
58,@GuyNorcal Love this! For you I know it has always been about the art!
59,RT @krybharat: 1/ The NFT space is unfortunately becoming increasingly like DeFi.  Where tribalism and rugs were common place.  We see bad…
60,@ryancarson You didn't have her that long. Hopefully the feeling passes quickly. Good-looking maskie.
61,@ImGlassCrown @illestrater_ @SevensGrant That's amazing!!!
62,"RT @ImGlassCrown: ""Blood Bath"" in NYC. 🔥
THANK YOU @illestrater_ and @SevensGrant! This made my morning! 😍 https://t.co/jgCGEfr3id"
63,@0xM4r1 @WoodiesNFT I love it!!
64,@ultraliskETH @MetaverseQueens The whole point is that I'm not doing a cash grab with cheesy art.
65,@ultraliskETH @MetaverseQueens I didn't say that. I am making a project for charity that 100% goes directly to a charity wallet. It won't even hit the dev wallet. Plus it is art I like and other women might too. You get a charity receipt as a write off on mint. The funds will support women in NFTs.
66,@nekosmother Thank you Maddie!!
67,@chriswallace @Waxbones @Ultra_DAO I actually flipped it for a quick profit. Lol!
68,"I have WAY MORE 1/1s from incredible artists in #NFTs than I do generatives, butI still have too many pfp projects that I minted."
69,"@ImGlassCrown Lol!! I think it was Oak that coined a new phrase. JOMO, JOY OF MISSING OUT. Happy I wasn't part of this hype train.

This guy is for sure going to turn into a permanent meme. Also the more I look at him the more I get used to his weird. This one might be worth something someday."
70,@lavhanna_art 💔 is there anything I can do to help?
71,"@grelysian @tigerbobNFT Unfortunately I did not. Had remorse about the Bored Apes, then I realized why??? I can still make it with out that stuff."
72,@lavhanna_art I'm so sorry. You look tired. 😑
73,@richerd I feel the same way!! https://t.co/wpCXdCPtka
74,"RT @richerd: When I started collecting NFTs, it was all about the art. 

It feels like its no longer all about the art..."
75,@grelysian I was saying this just today. I'm liquidating most of my generatives. Only buying art I like again. Forget the apes and the other hyped up trains. I'm done with 99.9% of collectables. @tigerbobNFT is excluded from this obviously because they are hand made and the art is great.
76,@naehrstff_nft Thank you!
77,@Swixel Lol!

79,@kaltmachine @Dripps_Design Which I wanted to delete immediately when I saw it. Yet here it sits.

94,@ResetNft @pan_danil @stopstare This is my favorite piece of yours so far. You're incredible and keep getting better and better!
95,@naehrstff_nft I normally don't do ugly. But I'm really upset by the war. https://t.co/Lxs7PkoBGK
96,@oak_arrow 1000000%
97,@ResetNft @pan_danil @stopstare Oh man I got chills seeing this.
98,@oak_arrow I think I'm going to definitely have to start setting my prices about 3Ξ after the pixelmon debacle. The bar is low and we can do better.
99,@oak_arrow Seriously! I mean they paid 3Ξ for the last rug a piece. That's mind blowing. That could have suppored a lot of artists and they would have actually liked what they got.
