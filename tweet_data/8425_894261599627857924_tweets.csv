You should be scared of crypto, it's low transparency, too difficult to understand, no one can explain it, full of scammers, and the only thing that happens there are coming from the legacy system trying to enter that space.

This is the mainstream narrative."
21,"4/6

And the best thing, the top stories there:

JPMorgan in the Metaverse and Melania Trump NFTs on Solana.

Later it is mentioned that the buyer for the Melania NFT was found out to be Melania's wallet itself. Yup so much for ""low transparency"". https://t.co/pRn7XTvLo4"
22,"3/6

If you can't use google, can you argue that information on the internet is not accessible?

The narrative in mainstream media is pretty much still: Crypto scary, status quo good. 

What happened to Occupy Wallstreet. Why do we hate Banks but don't want to change the system?"
23,"2/6

""There is news from the high flying, low transparency world of digital investments"".

How does this low transparency narrative propagate so much? Just because you don't know how to use blockchain explorers does that mean it's not transparent?"
24,"The Crypto narrative in the mainstream is so awful it hurts. And there are several bad takes.

Just look at the spooky theme, as if it's something to be scared of.
