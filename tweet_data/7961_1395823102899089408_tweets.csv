Lots of ways to provide IRL utility, and I think most successful ones will provide something along the lines of in the long term. 
Some NFT's provide an insane amount of networking to its holders."
25,@0xWNTR @WeaverTn_nft @ZadChris @TakeoffTone OHHH were you replying to the utility that the IP would provide an individual? I thought the statement was in reference to the scope of NFT utility. I was like -NAHHH 🤣
26,"@0xWNTR @WeaverTn_nft @ZadChris @TakeoffTone @BMC_NFT 100% of community funds are managed democraticly by NFT holders. With time, once our BTC yield is aggressive enough, we will vote to take profits into our personal wallets.
We also have a BTC miner leasing program.
We also are building other utilities that canny be spoken of yet"
27,"@0xWNTR @WeaverTn_nft @ZadChris @TakeoffTone NFT utility can present itself in MANY ways. @BMC_NFT for instance is a democratic business model.
The community wallet is funded with now 120 BTC  miners (100 purchased with mint revenue, the other 20 aquired post mint.)"
28,"@0xWNTR @WeaverTn_nft @ZadChris @TakeoffTone That's the sketchiest ""utility"" I've ever heard of. Even if this were to come to fruition for a project, which I'm sure it will, if that's the only utility then only a handful of people out of the entire collection win."
