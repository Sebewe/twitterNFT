1,@ReginM06 Appreciate ser. Have been at startups for a while but have yet to take the leap myself. Soon 🤝
2,@ohDotss Damn dots you old
3,@ReginM06 100%. I hope to be one of them soon :)
4,@katalystkyle 100% agree
5,It annoys me that people throw their money into projects because the founder is “ex Facebook”. This literally only means they can pass an interview and design a button
6,Source: I'm a function lead at a hypergrowth startup and interview 3+ people a week. I've been at this company for 3 years and have seen who does well in the longterm
7,"Ex consultants are even worse. They have cookie cutter frameworks to answer interview questions but can't operate in practice. Lots of talk, very little action. End rant"
8,"Hot take: talent from tech giants like FB, Google, Amazon largely SUCKS. While they are able to game interviews, they struggle with ambiguity on the job. Failed startup founders are by far the best hires"
