10,Aaron Donald deserves a 100 Block Shed rating in Madden.
11,When in doubt…give the ball to Cooper Kupp.
12,Is it just me or is this game flying by?!  Starting to feel like Pepsi is trying to remind us this game is just the opening act to the concert.

26,"Observations/Takeaways Cont.
- Brand equity and culture are so intertwined.  The authenticity of a project can be defined by the types of partnerships secured.  For me @AngryPitbullCLB has so much clarity when it comes to what is ""on brand"". #APC #Hoodville #Hennessy"
27,"Observations/Takeaways Cont.
- Better Web2 mousetraps seem doomed in Web3.  Reimagining what the world 'could be' is the promise; not incremental change.  For me @nudiecommunity is demonstrating that at scale with their all female team. #NudieCommunity #SendNudies #WomeninNFTs"
28,"Observations/Takeaways Cont.
- Communities come in all shapes and sizes.  Discord activity is a valuable signal, however it's not everything.  For me @BALLERZ_NFT tapped into a 90's video game nostalgia and hoop culture. #Ballerz #BallerzNation #BallerzFollowBallerz"
29,"Observations/Takeaways:
- Project discovery is rather messy &amp; full of friction.  I still believe WoM recommendations is the best way to go for people new to this space.
- Twitter Spaces is a solid solution for due diligence.  Listening to someone speak can tell you all you need."
30,"Notable Highlights:
1️⃣ First project I minted:  @AngryPitbullCLB 
2️⃣ First project I aped:  @BALLERZ_NFT 
3️⃣ Founder inspired me to mint:  @nudiecommunity"
