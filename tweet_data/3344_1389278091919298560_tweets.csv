2,"@AnChainAI If I hadn’t bought my one and only #ForeverApe🦍 for 0.4 $ETH on May 2nd, 2021, then I would have *loved* an extra #BAYC NFT to trade for a punk and the extra Ξth from it to roll into other #NFT projects after the BAYC/Punk “flippening” last year.

$ETH at 140 $USD (in late-March of 2020) was a great pre-#BAYC buy, too!
