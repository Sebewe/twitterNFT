53,If you’d buy an NFT to support this please follow with post notifications on. You can unfollow after purchase (if this happens) just want to make sure I gather enough people to make an impact for them.
54,Just a thought. If it made more than needed I’d just go to a neighboring town and give more families housing. I’d only use this for families that are  homeless with children. There’s a lot here.
55,"I’ve talked to these families and every time I ask them what they need from Walmart it’s always Water, blankets, food. Never asking for money, so I don’t think they’re scamming."
56,Important note: I think they’re at a shelter right now because I haven’t seen them in a few weeks (it’s 15 degrees out). Come spring is when they usually come back and live out of their mini vans.
57,"There are a couple families with kids that live in the Walmart parking near me. I don’t have the means to get them all into apartments, but I am a designer. Would anybody support an NFT project where 100% of profit goes to getting these families housing? I’d video document it all"
