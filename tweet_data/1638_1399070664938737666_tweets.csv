1,@friesframe Looks more like a deranged Squirtle to me.
2,@AndyTheNguyen @BoredApeYC Best
3,@NFTFutureNFT @VictoriorCG Best wishes!
4,@sunsetventurer @BoredApeYC Welcome!
5,@TaxmanNFT @jmt_nft This is the approach I’ve landed on. Seems like a good argument can be made.
6,@sandrikNFT Dance!
7,@EverydayJohn_ 🚩
8,@painter_crypto This is amazing 😂
9,@JetSetTogether What an adorable cat. So sorry for what you are both going thru.
10,"@tmagled @doodles To be clear, I wouldn’t think less of you or anyone else for doing it because it would ultimately be owner negligence. I just wouldn’t feel right myself, if that makes any sense."
11,@tmagled @doodles I personally would not feel good about doing this.
12,@LooksRareNFT We are all Kevin.
13,@4311_fandango @BoredApeYC Awesome!
14,@BitcoinCollette @BenjaminBitcoin @BoredApeYC Awesome to have you! It’s such a fun community.
15,@BitcoinCollette @BenjaminBitcoin @BoredApeYC Welcome!
16,@BoredApeYC I bet Jimmy the Monkey is up to some bullshit again.
17,RT @BoredApeYC: Gordo asleep. V posts leaks. https://t.co/RUKaPQRQ64
18,@XaosBear Congrats and welcome!
19,"@ArtHouseGarbage Sorry to hear that. Frustrating, but hopefully many more great opportunities head your way."
20,@BAYC967 @K3n_eth @yugalabs @BoredApeYC I agree. Just hope they keep apes central/benefitting from it since we were here from the beginning. I think they will.
21,@tattedseal @SappySealsNFT @BoredApeYC Welcome!
22,@YatMuseum Happy birthday!
23,@vivianegbr @dagg3rhigh Came here to do this. Would totally look like Kevin.
24,@phibacka31 Mine is that sometimes even execution and delivery aren’t enough. We both have a mutual project we like a lot that just can’t seem to catch a break …
25,@BoredApe4662 Taxes.
26,"RT @dagg3rhigh: 🐒 Posting this here before any discords 🐒

BAYC and MAYCs can claim 400WLs from @TribesNFT.

Important note: please read th…"
27,@JetSetTogether Oh no. This is awful.
28,@TjKongz @cipcity @ApeDao_ @BoredApeYC Great ape!
29,@XaosBear @BoredApeYC Welcome!
30,@QualityNames_ @yugalabs I blocked this guy a while ago — must have done something else then because I seldom block people.
31,@phantom_scribbs I wish @artblocks_io did a watch app. Would love to rock my 720 minutes.
32,@chrisdevlin7700 Sorry to hear that. Hope all ends up well.
33,"@KingBlackBored @economist @AB84 No, he corrected himself. They have 100k discords!"
34,"@economist @AB84 I dunno man. Most projects boast 100,000 people in a discord. This project has 100,000 discords. Sounds rare."
35,I’ve been a fan of Tribes since winning this special ape giveaway in my early NFT days. @dagg3rhigh and the team are top notch and discord storytelling has always been different from anywhere in the space. I don’t shill and this isn’t an ad. I’m just a fan. Check out his thread. https://t.co/USiXuCawQC https://t.co/IJlLdCSULt
36,@NFTbark @laurashin @OnChainMonkey Been listening to the audiobook on my runs. Really good! Big fan of her podcast Unchained too.
37,@GaryGeck I think it will all blow over.
38,@GaryGeck I take copyright very seriously and can’t stand projects that rip others off. But I don’t see this as one of those cases based on the evidence I have seen so far. (Don’t own any.)
39,"@CliveApestein @GeneralDegener8 Yes, this is what I was thinking of. Thanks!"
40,"@GeneralDegener8 I read this too. I can’t quite remember who it was but feel like it had to do with going directly to contract and interacting with it and then adding the shortcut when MM popped up. And then not confirming transaction. Might have been Ding, 6529, or Loop."
41,"Whatever you do, don’t try to figure out why Nintendo Switch is trending."
42,"@skominers @gregggonsalves @CDCgov Yeah, this sadly seems like 💯 politics."
43,"@LinusCaldwell5 @CryptoMories @KingBlackBored Yeah, that’s clearly BS. I take copyright more seriously than many in this space and seems clearly different to me."
44,@ElliotAvidane @BoredApeYC Welcome!
45,@NizzyNFT Maybe next year.
46,RT @carsonturner: I think @opensea needs to make an immediate post letting their followers/customers know that this is a scam! Let’s protec…
47,@carsonturner @opensea 😱. Scary stuff.
48,@_benxit_ @GratefulPillar Make sure you are running the most recent version. That is what it usually is when this happens to me.
49,"Bravo. Elon keeps adding value to the world, and people like Elizabeth Warren and the SEC continue to collect government checks and come at him with frivolous complaints and criticisms. https://t.co/wSKmPkVHUZ"
50,"With all the BS copycat ripoff projects, @CryptoMories is the one that gets delisted?!? This space is crazy sometimes. What am I missing?  Has someone seen something blatant I haven’t?"
51,"@justin3ckrich @BoredApeYC @nftworldsNFT @TheSandboxGame @decentraland They might, but I have a gut feeling they might be building their own."
52,"@AlexStemplewski Floor BAYC, but either is great."
53,"@PuffYatty I would laugh, but then do the right thing."
54,"@joel_minchin88 @ArtHouseGarbage @DeadHeadsNFT No, I’m not a movie star 😂. Just a simple bored ape."
55,@ArtKaroon9 @BoredApeYC Love it!
56,"@joel_minchin88 @ArtHouseGarbage @DeadHeadsNFT The NFT is @DeadHeadsNFT. This was just a fun parody song I did for mine, who I named Boo Marley. He also is infamous for scything the sheriff. But he didn’t scythe the deputy."
57,@gayboredape @BoredApeYC Awesome!
58,@gayboredape @BoredApeYC I’m trying to make it — I have something else going on in June and not positive I’m going to be able to do both. Would be great to finally meet in person though!
59,"@thenftattorney @2PunksCapital @doodles Good for you. The less of actual law practice I’ve done over my career, the happier I’ve been. It is a good knowledge base, but the other stuff is often more fun!"
60,@gayboredape @BoredApeYC You are always part of the family!
61,@crystalhefner @JpgJsh Awesome!
62,@PeterVoogd23 @BoredApeYC @CCrewNFT Welcome!
63,Pixelmon reveal at least gave a lot of us a genuine laugh after what has been a horrible week for the world. There is that I guess?
64,@carvethedegen @BoredApeYC Hi there! https://t.co/wSQF5YduzQ
65,@turbo2056 @DeadHeadsNFT @nashvillian88 Pretty sure they have it because of the Grateful Dead considering the sticker in the upper left! But maybe they like both!
66,@economist Happy birthday!
67,@cr0ssETH Congrats on doing what is right for you and for the sale!

69,@JetSetTogether Glad you are okay.
70,"@NizzyNFT I worry he would do the same thing as Bitcoin — get people all excited and then somehow disparage it and cause a dump.
Love what he does with cars and space, but don’t know he is great for crypto at the moment."
71,@_Beastnode A lot worse places to be stuck 😂
72,@phibacka31 I’ve worked in politics and there are some. But the amazing ones are few and far between.
73,@itsdanataylor That’s pretty close to what I wear when my NFT merch is in the laundry.
74,"@lavhanna_art Ugh, I’m so sorry. As a parent also, this just is heartbreaking."
75,@Ashleyyy_w @BoredApeYC Congrats and welcome!
76,@BadJuJuNFT @BoredApeYC Welcome!
77,@TheGOODmanLife1 @BoredApeYC Welcome!
78,@TheCryptoBR Welcome!
79,@nft_lovely @BoredApeYC Welcome!
80,@NFTWifeLife @RDM_41 Thanks!
81,@WSJ Thanks WSJ! https://t.co/igrjrs9tPm
82,@NFTWifeLife @RDM_41 I’m with you minus the pregnancy. Starting my own company soon. Hang in there — one day at a time!
83,"@GOON8686 @AstonDreamz @BAYC7621 Yeah, this is definitely part of it. A lot of us have been rekt/narrowly avoided it by pump-and-dumps and pre-reveal run-ups and when we warn others, it gets called FUD."
84,@AstonDreamz This has not been my experience at all. Sorry if you had a bad experience.
85,"Mood:
“Come you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks”

https://t.co/Q4xPAOWg9n"
86,"@xBenJamminx Yeah, I can’t believe we are rolling from global pandemic right into either WWIII or a new Cold War. Just awful."
87,@JetSetTogether I’m so sorry this is happening. Please stay safe!
88,@zhannetpodobed So sorry to see this. Stay safe.
89,@mihaylova_jpg So sorry you are going through this.
90,Heart goes out to everyone in harm’s way right now. Stay safe.
91,@QualityNames_ @BoredApeYC Please.
92,@PuffYatty Answer is always the ape.
93,"@BigM33sh I feel this. I still come on to hang, but would take something very special for me to mint."
94,@friesframe Congrats!
95,@NizzyNFT I even still have some fiat 😂
96,@RDM_41 I have a call with mine next week now that I’ve shown her all my activity and how I think it should be reported. Should be interesting.
97,@JunicsETH @BoredApe1000 @CryptoGarga @GordonGoner @TomatoBAYC @SassBAYC I’m just missing Tomato! Maybe some day!
98,@AviAisenberg @hypnotizedApe @BoredApeYC @yugalabs @Tesla Nice! I almost picked up that plate a few months ago. Glad to see it’s in good hands and on a Tesla!
99,@RDM_41 @tobyai @laurashin Really enjoy her podcast and looking forward to reading her book.
