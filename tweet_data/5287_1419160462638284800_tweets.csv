4,"A most likely scenario: V2 punks will buy and keep both the V1 and V2 identical. It iron out the risk of either of them becoming worthless.

Punk pfp of this group of people will have dual-coloured background."
5,And it could be the other way: V1 punk burning their V2 identical but the likelyhood of this playing out quite low because the financial incentive is less considering the higher V2 price.
6,"My take of how V1 vs V2 will play out:
Because V1 at 25% price, V2 punks will buy up their V1 to burn it so that their V2 are unique. But reducing the total supply of V1 will increase the V1 price. https://t.co/bMgk4QNy1k"
