From today, and for the next 31 days, I will share a notable #Woman in the #wine world.

Highly recommended.

44,"Young, powerful, complex. It hits you with deep ripe cherries, plums, smoky oak, vanilla first, then a secondary wave of leather, black pepper, and dark chocolate. If you had to show someone what ""deep flavour"" meant and you had to use only one wine, this would be it."
45,"How was the wine?
Well, Amarone is very often an extremely pleasurable experience, and this was no different - I admit the emotional attachment might have enhanced the tasting experience, I give you that.

I decanted it for only 6 hours too, it probably needed a full day."
46,"Just a few months before his retirement he was diagnosed with cancer, and wine was definitely something he had to say goodbye to.

A few days ago it was the anniversary of his death, so I decided to crack this bad boy open too soon, to celebrate his premature departure."
47,"This was a gift not intended for me, but for my late father on the day of his retirement. He popped it in our family cellar and waited for me to go visit back home, in Italy.

He knew he wouldn't have the chance to drink it."
48,"This is a very special bottle to me. A magnum (1.5 liters) of Begali Lorenzo 𝗔𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗮 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝗽𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗮 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗰𝗼 𝟮𝟬𝟬𝟬.

55,"@Skootch1234 I wouldn't do it with all red ones. It's a case by case scenario, I'd say any wine that benefits from long decanting?

You can definitely experiment, at the end of the day it all comes down to personal preference (I decant a lot, some people don't like it as much)"
56,"Make sure it's in a dry, cool place out of the light.

After slowly and gently breathing like that for 24 hours, it will taste a lot better than just after opening.

#wine #WomeninWine #SuperTuscans #Italy #NFTCommunity #WomeninNFTs"
57,"🔥 HOT TIP 🔥

Super Tuscans have the 'double-feature' of being really approachable when young, and also age very well thanks to their complex tannins. 

If you want to get the most out of your wine, uncork it and leave the bottle open for 24 hours."
58,"The press ran back to the states to write about these wines but couldn’t bring themselves to call these amazing bottles Vino Da Tavola. They were more than that. So, they used a term that they had heard being bandied about among these rebel winemakers, Super Tuscan."
59,"When the American press came to taste these wines that were causing such a stir, they fell in love with them immediately.

They were full bodied, some of them used Bordeaux grapes such as Cab Sav as the framework for the blend, causing the press to compare them to great Bordeaux."
60,"By 1975 a group of winemakers, fed up with these rules, began going out on their own, eschewing the DOC laws in order to make better quality wine.

To make wine outside the guidelines meant forcing that wine to be labelled Vino Da Tavola, the lowest step of the ladder."
61,"The Ricasoli blend, however, allowed up to 20% of white wine, which meant winemakers looking to get more bang for their buck utilized that 20% to the fullest.

The result was a significant drop in the quality, and by the mid 70s Chianti’s international reputation began to falter."
62,"From vintage to vintage, even though weather patterns change, there were guidelines to aid in maintaining the legacy of a wine region.

In 1967 Chianti was awarded its own DOC and, because the Barone Ricasoli blend was the most used, this was the blend that made it into law."
63,"Italy, as other 'old world' wine countries, has a very extensive and frankly quite rigid set of rules surrounding its 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀.

The appellations system was a way to control the quality of wine by putting rules in place within a designated area. https://t.co/7XDaFbx5Dw"
64,"@rosio_png Understandable, but when it's 4 euros a glass and it slaps you out of reality in 2 glasses, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do YNWIM."
