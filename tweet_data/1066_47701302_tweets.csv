They unlock entirely new superpowers for humanity.

↳ make digital objects scarce.
↳ enforce agreements without a court.
↳ automate value transfer without an intermediary.

These superpowers seem simple enough, but they'll change the world."

97,"@pixlpa Andrew, it's such a pleasure to build this ecosystem together."
98,"A shared contract is just that: shared. 

Artists’ work shouldn’t be tied to the platform it was minted on. It should stand on its own."
99,"In December, we launched Collections.

Each collection is backed by its own ERC-721 smart contract, deployed by the artist themself.

We believe creator-owned contracts are the superior form of provenance in web3."
