68,What are your #Discord Discord Tips&amp;Tricks? 💡👇🏼
69,8/ Always remember that everyone only recently started being active in this space so don’t hold back in asking any questions. We all have to start somewhere and this is the most supportive community to learn something new 🙌🏼✨
70,7/ As for everything in this space; always make sure to check if this is a safe link to connect your wallet to. If uncertain; ASK! ❗️
71,"6/ Once you are part of a project (hold one of their NFTs) often they will have a separate “holders” channel, where you can only get access to after you verified you are a holder. Therefor you have to connect your Wallet - normally via a CollabLand bot - to proof you own one.🖼"
72,"5/ Now all their other channels will open up and you’ll be able to have a wander around the discord. You will often find #sneakpeeks #FAQ en #roadmap and you’ll be able to communicate with the community, make connections and ask questions! 🤝"
73,4/ ..to the rest of the channels with more information and general chat channel with the rest of the community! See example of the @PartyDegens discord welcome channel : https://t.co/7CRXp0jkjU
74,"3/ Most projects discords welcome you in a ‘Welcome’ channel, and often this is the only channel you can see. Here they explain the basic rules and share information about the project. Normally you can then click an emoji at the end of the text which will then allow you access👇🏼"
75,2/ Safety first. When you open discord for the first time; go to your Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety &gt; and turn off ‘Allow direct messages from server members’. This will stop scammers from being able to DM you fake links. If you haven’t already done this: make sure to turn it off❌ https://t.co/zTqxqg90Fd
76,"1/ Found a new project and want to get to know their ideas, roadmap &amp; community? ✨Then you want to join the projects discord! Most projects will have a link to their discord in their Twitter bio or website. ⚠️ Make sure to only join links via the official website &amp; Twitter❗️"

78,@enumlikedenim @discord Same for me!! Took weeks before I finally started using discord! Such a shame because there is so much value and connections to be made in the discords!
79,@TheNFTG0ddess 🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/V1GtjspV4D
80,@cryptoxgoddess Hey fren! Awesome you are joining the NFT space!! I would recommend to look around and ask questions to learn more about the space and be able to make a decision on which project would be a good fit for you!!
