11,@Loopifyyy The only games I've played consistently over the years are pokemon and Minecraft. I still play them.

13,@SirPantsALot2 @0xS1MN I always pick the blue pokemon lol. The first time I didn't I believe it was treecko. This time I'm between the red or the green one 🤷.

47,@DiscoverXnft Try using an animated NFT as your pfp. It only works when you click on their username.

53,@hotdoggawd Can't wait for the next episode.
54,RT @Temptranquil: $0 in paid promotions. Thats why. We’re still growing exponentially because we make a real product. Hype always falls to…
55,@DiscoverXnft The crazy thing is that it was a free mint . Some people validate once they see others praise it.

57,"@chriswallace @DeezeFi Oh. I never played Roblox haha so idk, I've played Minecraft for years though."
58,@chriswallace @DeezeFi It's basically Minecraft.
59,@chriswallace @DeezeFi Their website has all the info for $wrld. https://t.co/qymuW27K5c
60,@__gvan__ 🤔
61,"@chriswallace @DeezeFi Well 2 main reasons. One is the snapshot at the end of this month for $wrld. Two is because of staking coming soon. Basically depending on rarity your world will provide 55-200$wrld daily. Also you can play in any device and earn $wrld via a gasless system (PC, console, mobile). https://t.co/YJHYnRtJuY"
62,@nosleepjon 😤 strong tease
63,@heyhaigh Lol. I remember I had a BAYC sticker of my ape on the back of my car 4 months ago. Once the floor got to 3 eth I removed it because I was worried of the attention I might get 😂.
64,@chriswallace @DeezeFi A free mint 4 months ago ser
65,I heard a new Beach House album is coming out at midnight 🤔
66,@HollanderAdam @nftworldsNFT From a free mint to.
67,"Gonna share one of the best moves I made a few weeks ago.
-stumple onto NFT worlds
-do research
-I have been playing Minecraft for years and still play
-sell a snadbox plot for about 4eth
-buy a floor NFT world in the top 5000 rank for about 3.3eth
-watching it moon 🚀"
68,@MrSnowy10 @EthereumDenver Nice
69,Just checked price 😲👀 https://t.co/LTuFlyJTzz
70,@3MaskTear @grayboysdao If it's your only one I would probably sell then buy a world and 1 or 2 gray boys and the rest keep lol
71,🥩 soon https://t.co/0L1cdYHH9x
72,@DiscoverXnft 34E was nice. I remember telling you to take it down at 20 E. It could still rise higher if eth stays around where it's at and the ape token drop.
73,"@NathanHeadPhoto Yeah, the first episode is great 👍."

89,@BrickHoganNFT @tdKale @DiscoverXnft Anyone can play. On their discord it shows you how to receive the $wrld token by testing out their server. I think you have to use the / command with your eth address.
90,"@tdKale @BrickHoganNFT @DiscoverXnft I don't think so, but there are other worlds you can play in. You can play their test server right now and earn a bit of $wrld. It has about 1000 people testing right now."
91,@DiscoverXnft I say ser and ma'am to almost everyone out of habit. Even in a drive through lol.
92,@NathanHeadPhoto You should start Attacking on Titan next 👍
93,@tdKale @DiscoverXnft NFT world will do that for about 5 years. The one I own is in the top 5000 world and it will give me 122$wrld daily by staking. This chart calculates how much I will earn in 5 years if $wrld is priced at .2. Currently $wrld is .34 cents. This is just from staking not playing. https://t.co/tQ503yqhf6
94,@relar901201 @1Bprice @nftworldsNFT @skuxxverse I minted a few since it's only .07 eth but they own 15 worlds now.
95,@relar901201 @1Bprice @nftworldsNFT Maybe @skuxxverse could be a play 🤷
96,@DiscoverXnft I sold one of my sandbox plots around 4 eth to buy an NFT world around 3 eth. I should have had more conviction and bought more lol https://t.co/Vxk0e0tbBm
