It’s just so tough bc both were intricate rugs, and I just can’t choose which one I enjoyed more!

What are your thoughts, let me know kekw"

47,"Early call: @AtomoKidsPJB 

They don't have a Discord yet, that's how early we're talking. Art is insane, fits the current narrative, and low supply. https://t.co/27D1mVnxCQ"

49,@AtomoKidsPJB can you make it right now
50,@AtomoKidsPJB where is your discord
51,update: Kevin's name is in the metadata as a trait in Pixelmon. I want to apologize for the disrespect and any confusion this may have caused to Kevin and his family.
52,"@champtgram its in the traits.....

ffs"
53,"so let me get this straight:

pixelmon pulled off one of the most insane heists ever, is currently selling for 0.4, and you mfs are buying ""Kevin"" which was named by the community for over 3+ ETH as a fuckin meme

AND THEN someone makes a Kevin mfer

what the fuck is happening https://t.co/bS7IVFDNOe"

55,"Don't get me wrong, I love that projects are trying to build something long term. The fact is that most of these teams won't deliver. I don't like bag holding. I like to seize an opportunity, take profits, and move on to the next opportunity."

70,"here is my philosophy for not having WL and wanting to buy something
-people paper hard when WL mints
-once WL has minted out floor usually spikes a bit
-if there is a public and you don't have a bot, not worth
-once public mints out it will rise and retrace

I buy when WL papers"
71,@GluttonNFT @SatoshiRunnerz no
72,"These days I hardly ape into shit on secondary unless it feels insanely undervalued

Otherwise my strat has been to mint off WL, flip, and buy back in lower if I truly have faith in the project"
73,"I didn't get WL for @SatoshiRunnerz so I decided to wait and see what they were selling for on secondary

Mint: 0.07
Floor: 0.13 (feels cheap)

I love pixel art but more importantly there is staking, breeding and you earn $SATOSHI

Disclaimer not an ad, I bought 3 off secondary https://t.co/JJftK4SF6N"

89,"@OttoSuwenNFT I agree, and Azuki is overvalued imo. I like them for sure, but want to start seeing their plans get rolled out.

Would like to buy both Azuki and a NFT World once I feel a good bottom."
90,"Looks like we are seeing another retrace for some big projects:

-Azuki: 10.3
-Clone X: 12.8
-MAYC: 17.6
-Cool Cats: 8.5
-NFT Worlds: 12.69

Everything seems to be trending down. I'm guessing we will likely bottom out soon and go on another run within the next few weeks or so https://t.co/NKg70pIiSZ"
