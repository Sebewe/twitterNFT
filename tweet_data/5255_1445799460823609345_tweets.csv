12,"@Crypto_Zazu Very true. Not sure how worried people would be about price volatility. But if I were staking, I'd just set and forget like you said. High volatility is second nature in this market after all"
13,I'm out of the loop. Any good pfp projects out there with a floor sub 1 eth? I'm looking at @CryptoMories right now 👀
14,"@Crypto_Zazu Interesting game theory here. If everyone stakes, there won't be any revenue. And then if demand is high and a few decide to hit high bids, that could cause a cascade of selling if the premium from selling outweighs the sales revenue"

41,@MonieGang @Feld4014 Only BAYC unfortunately. But someone should hit up NFTX about a MAYC pool though
42,"@idrawanimation @bayc9797 @BoredApeYC Wow, this is a sick animation!"
43,RT @NBATopShotEast: If you’re an ape mutant or dog and can’t get your followers up. Just hop in the BAYC discord. Verify ownership and send…
44,"7. Overall, this is an interesting financial instrument because AMMs act as algorithmic portfolio managers. So when people buy BAYC, your pair is worth more eth and less BAYC. And vice-versa. Nice find @Feld4014"
45,6. It won't necessarily track floor prices since this AMM tracks its own price vs eth. So be aware of this
46,"5. Not much is trading right now, but that's probably because the pool is small. This pool allows smaller investors to get BAYC exposure without owning an ape. But..."
47,"Because one ape + eth equates to about $250k, you'd be earning 73% APR in $SUSHI plus trading fees. Not bad if you're the only one in the pool (someone check my math)"
48,"3. Because the farming yields 50 $SUSHI total to all farmers, you will only see a fraction of this as more depositors start farming. If you were the whole pool, you would get about $500 a day at current rates"
49,"2. There are analytics for the pool here: https://t.co/9fGnlhC6cl. The pool ony has one ape, so buying 0.05 back might cost you some slippage"
50,"1. NFTX collects a 5% fee, so instead of getting 1 BAYC, you get 0.95 BAYC. It seems like to get your ape back, you will have to top off 0.05 BAYC, which requires you to buy this amount from the liquidity pool"
51,I like this post from @Feld4014. I wanted to add some color as to what a yield farmer would be getting into since he clarified that a random ape would be withdrawn from the NFTX vault https://t.co/yDHbgQrZ5V
52,RT @Feld4014: Got a floor ape and an equivalent value of ETH sitting around? 55 Sushi ($600) a day worth of sushi is ripe for the pickins!…
53,"@Feld4014 How does the minting process work? My ape gets deposited into the NFTX vault, but I would deposit however much BAYC I minted to get my ape back? Or do I get a random ape from the vault back?"
54,Also I should mention that this is not affiliated with BAYC (as the discord mods emphasize). This is purely informational. And yes I have claimed
55,"I forgot to post the screenshot, haha... here it is https://t.co/R475zFs96i"
56,"7. Hope this helps. #apefollowape. Join us, whether you have an ape or not in our discord. https://t.co/3fOQP6wHpB"
57,"6. This is a safe method. I like that there is an explicit claim function (so we need to pay attention to take part in FOMO) instead of an airdrop. There have been a lot of spam airdrops recently, so I appreciate this approach"
58,"5. At line 59, the contract wallet sends FOMO to your wallet. There are no contract approvals throughout this process, so you are not granting access for any tokens in your wallet to be withdrawn"
59,4. The other for-loops for MAYC (starting at line 43) and BAKC (starting at line 51) tokens do the same thing as the initial for-loop
60,"3. Using the first for-loop defined at line 35, it adds to n how many BAYC tokens you have (line 38) if your specific BAYC token hasn't been marked as claimed yet (line 37). At each iteration, it marks your BAYC token as accounted for (in case you try to call the method again)"
61,"2. The claim method is defined from line 31 to 61. The TL;DR of what it's doing is it checks how many of each BAYC, MAYC and BAKC tokens you have in your wallet and sends 69 multiplied by this total of FOMO to your wallet. Contracts it scans for are defined in lines 18 through 20"
62,1. Attached is a screenshot of the claim code from ApeFomo.sol. It might be easier to save the image so you can see which lines I'm referencing. Or open a tab to see the code here: https://t.co/OBMLZB3IUW (File 1 of 14: ApeFomo.sol)
63,"With all of the scams afoot recently (and these will not stop), I thought it'd be helpful to go through @MachiBigBrother's link to ApeFomo contract to claim FOMO. Questions were floating around the BAYC discord, so I wanted to help. A thread... https://t.co/okSyRRJIcF"
