I have friends who aren't as financially savvy, and I worry that they'll have to wage-slave just to make ends meet. It already happened to some hometown friends. I just want a place to call my own and spare $."

17,@anthonykritis Getting over my last relationship and visualizing all the happy memories and realizing that they aren’t too different from happy memories I can make w friends or other partners was the key realization from today.
18,"I never got into journaling, but have been finding a lot of relief through it. Too often do I have so many thoughts in my head, but I can't recall how to process them, and then I forget about it the next day. Writing it down allows me to validate my emotions in a concise format."

93,@benjamin____s @Deadfellaz Tbf deadfellaz was teetering from .5-&gt; .8 for the longest time while capping out at 1 Eth. I don’t think what you did was a bad trade at all (depending on buy in). It makes sense to bet on Betty because it’s honestly amazing that she’s a mom and she operates DF with her husband.

99,@EthThedave @dollar_monopoly Oh you’re referring to the text on the left hand side. There’s a discord group called ERCSniper - they have a google chrome extension that displays rarities. Super useful when new collections come out and I can compare floor prices to see if people list rare ones for cheap
