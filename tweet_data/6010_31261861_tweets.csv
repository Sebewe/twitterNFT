12,RT @Dennis_Porter_: RT IF YOU WANT #BITCOIN LEGAL TENDER IN YOUR COUNTRY!
13,Pro tip: when you’re at a yoga retreat do not mention the metaverse and NFTs unless you want people to laugh at and mock you. We are still so early lol.

16,"RT @VitalikButerin: Reminder: Ethereum is neutral, but I am not."
17,I can’t think or talk about NFTs and crypto right now with people fighting for their lives and freedom. What’s happening in Ukraine is so fucking heartbreaking.

20,Hey guys is @thex2y2 airdrop safe and until when can you claim?
21,@nft_nate_ Okay good to know! Does revoking access protect you even after your sign something? It revokes the signature im assuming?
22,@TheHardHodler @Jon_HQ @BanklessHQ On https://t.co/jQdhKHWhua and etherscan
23,"@nft_nate_ I have a question about the opensea migration. I did it directly on the opensea website yesterday, not from the email link. Today I revoked all from both etherscan and https://t.co/jQdhKHWhua. So far nothing is gone from my wallet. Am I safe now that I have revoked everything?"
24,@la_da_kid What happens if you did the migration directly on opensea? Not by clicking the email
25,are the wallets allegedly being drained from the opensea issue ones that clicked the phishing email or did the migration directly from the website banner?
26,@thermalgadget @andrewbargis @opensea Okay i revoked everything to be safe 🙏🏼
27,@andrewbargis @opensea wait.. but i did it through the website banner? was that also phishing?
28,@Jon_HQ @BanklessHQ Wow what is happening! Regardless i have revoked it now. Does that mean we are safe?
29,@WomenTribe_nfts Just a bunch of bots though.
30,@reapxrrr @meta_angels Best community indeed!
31,@MsPolly11 Dang i was so excited to see the price dip but now i know why.
32,I was going to get a @NFTCryptoChicks because the price dropped but then I did some research why and it seemed the artist stole art from another female artist. Is this a 🚩guys? Kinda bummed because i really liked the art but i don’t like plagiarism… what would you do?
33,Hmmmm.. What is going on with $looks
