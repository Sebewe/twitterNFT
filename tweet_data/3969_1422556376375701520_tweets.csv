14,@ZacKenny @nellyanderthal well there is some team work

21,"GM all. Today’s micro-sketch giveaway is 'zodiac snake'.

How it works: chads are meant to be given away by the chad community. Nominate someone who may like it. I send it to them if they want it.

22,@_courtsjay the Celestine prophecy
23,"@debbietea8 the focus it takes means I cant focus on anything else, so it is more an avoidance mechanism"
24,let's do something together.
25,"If this recipient is someone new to the project (it's their first chad) then the nominator gets 1 $CHAD token.  These have value in the chadverse and can be redeemed for custom chads, colored chads, migration to the erc721 contract and more."
26,"You can no longer win a chad in a race.  What you can do is nominate a new owner for the daily chad  (don't nominate yourself, that's cringe). 

If your nominee is the first to express their desire to own, then they receive the chad."
27,"chavolution starts tomorrow.  

chad-canvas is an experiment in giving to the NFT community. no money, No shilling, no hype, no promotion, just what it is.

My greatest wish is that the project promotes a spirit of giving and inclusion.  So, we are switching it up."

39,There isn't a 1/1 season because there isn't a bubble.
40,"Taken together, I am very bullish on 1/1s, but over a much longer time scale.  We will look back upon this time and wonder why people would ever consider wasting eth on obvious cash grabs when art from 'XXXX person' was .05."
41,"Progress is 'slow' in nft terms, but I would argue this is a good thing.  1/1 artists aren't dopamine dealers, and that makes 1/1 art more sustainable in the long term.  The natural consequence of that is the market that we see collectively."
42,"1/1 art is a also gamble, yes, but it moves slow enough to take most of the dopamine potential from flipping out of the equation.  What this means is that buyer decisions can be (but not always are) made based on emotional connection, or maybe even a rational perception of value."
43,the discords for these projects are modern day opium dens.  Addicts complete forced rituals to get a chance for a hit.  These folks and the resulting hype are leveraged to create exit liquidity to complete that high inducing flip.  Skinner box anyone?
44,"and in the above statement lies the clue.  

price != value

and

gambling induced dopamine addiction leads to irrational decisions

and 

the dopamine payoff as a result of a terrible decision must be immediate or it wont hit."
45,"There is a disconnect here.  That is, a sh!t project with worse art somehow has a 3 ETH price, while I could buy 5-15 pieces of art from very talented folk that I would cherish for my entire life for the same amount."
46,"Rather, I am talking about the high quality work from artists grinding for sales below 1 ETH.  There are so many great artists.  I know, I look for them every day as a part of my morning ritual."
47,Of course we have to first acknowledge the massive sales of a very select group @muratpak @XCOPYART @seerlight @deekaymotion to name some of my favorites.  Their success is an inspiration to all artists.  But I am not talking about 100+ETH sales here.
48,The recent 3eth rug pull has me thinking a lot about 1/1s and perhaps why the 1/1 space hasn't seen an equivalent event.   I don't think it will and that is  good thing 🧵
49,@KrisVoitkiv me heart goes out to you and everyone in your country.  Your art is amazing.  Stay safe.
50,"@0xmoxxa and yet, a string of bad mints will drain your life."
51,"@snow_nft I buy what I feel...art that draws me in.  This is often early or even a genesis piece.  Then, I get to know the artist further and buy more (If I can afford it)."
52,"Special highlight to @KrisVoitkiv's new collection 'people in their bathrooms' is raw, an exposed nerve in a private place.  Support this Ukranian artist. Do you notice the soviet blue? 
https://t.co/Sn75Wd0wnw"
53,"next pick for @withFND mint of the day is 'Etherial' by @peterrooney_art. In fact the entire new collection 'the beautiful dance' is just amazing.  Everyone should check it out.
