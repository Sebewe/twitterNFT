0,RT @HarveyMultani: Access to egg freezing should be a human right
1,@jessziyuezhang Indeed 🙂
2,@RapaNews Love it. @IsmanAnar
3,@koimtv @koimtv agreed! It’s essentially forcing women to wait to do it when it’s in many cases too late. Looking at insurance products as well. Will keep you posted!
4,Correction: https://t.co/50nVvnuKY6
5,I’m working  on solving this and related problems in the fertility space. follow  👉 https://t.co/Wsawp3C92F
6,Every woman &lt;35 not ready to be a parent yet should have feasible options for freezing eggs that don’t involve $15k+ debt
7,"Beyond that, and some standard loan products, there are no great options for women 20-35 to freeze their eggs resulting in less women also donating eggs for parents who are in need of donor eggs.  3/"
8,Currently there are limited programs like Freeze &amp; Share which allow a woman to freeze their eggs at a heavy discount if they donate ~ half of the mature eggs retrieved. 2/
9,"Egg freezing costs upwards of $15k.. an expensive insurance policy for women in 20s/early 30s . Would more women freeze their eggs at this age if the cost was brought close to $0?

14,"@HarveyMultani 2/ A discount of $ x dollars if they buy would work, but that's being done in many ways already and dont think it would increase win rate drastically"
15,"@HarveyMultani maybe for small biz or startups. But an individual, the prospect at big corps wouldn't care about a stipend. It's  not going directly to her &amp; would be too small to have it be worth the logistics in setting up this AE's co as a vendor in order to accept the pmt."

17,"@CatherineTurn27 @lilykonings Impatient hiring manager + not wanting to answer questions  = 🚩🚩🚩
This is an easy ‘no’ for candidates ."
18,@tomfgoodwin Answer applies to any location.. sf was just low hanging fruit. People who had to move to Iowa just for a job likely bolted few years ago and moved wherever they actually wanted to live in.
19,"@tomfgoodwin Many moved away from the office location (eg  left SF) and understandably wouldn’t be willing to come back, having no relevance to their value"
20,@jeffweisbein hard to go wrong w/pics &amp; posts about #Miami

22,"why aren't more homeowners selling direct as FSOB's (for sale by owner)? 

what reasons besides access to MLS (which some direct listing firms provide for a small flat fee)?"
23,Still think a huge opportunity for someone to create a series of educational content for LinkedIn people sending DMs. https://t.co/4gUsry0XMC https://t.co/00UaN6I8pQ
24,@alexisohanian That’s a beautiful dog ❤️What breed(s)?
25,@lizgiorgi @WagWalking @GarrPS Awful 💔so sorry for your loss Liz

31,any good book recos on (startup) ideation/idea validation and/or customer discovery?
32,"@steeve @peteryared the solution is not testing daily to see each day if you have contracted it which is what many people are doing unnecessarily. there is of course cases where people test daily for work etc or testing in advance of seeing immune compromised person, your grandma etc.)"
33,@tomfgoodwin intriguing - are you going to rent it out again?
34,@steeve @peteryared incorrect. i'm simply asking what your suggested solution is.
35,@steeve @peteryared What exactly are you suggesting?
36,@steeve @peteryared the point is to not test if one doesnt have symptoms or doesnt feel sick which is what's happening in the US. the accuracy of test significantly reduces if asymptomatic.
37,"@steeve @peteryared correct, both neg and pos"
38,@steeve @peteryared all of them but especially antigen
39,@peteryared Yes.. &amp;false positive test result hysteria is not helpful

41,@thisMulloy Had no idea this trend was happening 🙃
42,@LaMoniRojas I didn’t ask but I assume how someone looks (eg people who ‘look like x type’)
43,just talked to a large consulting co recruiter who said they are not allowed to access linkedin for candidate pre-screen (to eliminate bias). first i've heard of a company eliminating LinkedIn as a recruiting tool.
44,@vincemcp Not yet 😑
45,@liladlc @Shaybloch @Jobox_ai Would love that!
46,I just fixed my garbage disposal and installed a new toilet seat in under 5 minutes instead of spending hours attempting to find a handyman in Miami. i think i'm ready to jump into rehabbing investment properties.

54,"Hey Twitter doctors, my (blood) antibody count increased relatively significantly from previous month, is the likely reason that I was exposed to Omicron, fought it off / was asymptomatic? Or that one of the tests was inaccurate?"

60,@BroductManager It’s an addiction
61,@Jason You can’t find out. That data doesn’t get released to patients.
62,@liladlc Yes .. I felt left out not having bought one and glad I didn’t. I usually just one click buy stuff on Amazon without much googling.
63,i just learned that air fyers are just basic (convection) ovens. was this common knowledge...

68,"i wonder if this will keep linkedin people from sending follow up messages? My guess is no..

And it's a shame that there's a max end date of 3 months to the away message. https://t.co/zYIfKXm8bW"
69,"Quite the holiday message 'you will suffer illness and death'.

For those who currently have covid, your natural immunity doesn't mean anything according to this administration &amp; you're contributing to the pandemic by not getting your booster on schedule. https://t.co/m0TVjIcDWC"
70,@williamhclark and let's not forget the new definition of 'unvaccinated' which includes people who've had covid already. Soon likely to include many of those who have covid currently and are overdue for their booster.

79,"@lpolovets Welcome! Was the best thing I did this year. Agree on your reasons- Personal freedom, warm weather, smart &amp; happy people make such a difference for me."
80,"@geri_kirilova Even smaller/micro funds? They typically don’t have budget and I think 10 hr/week internship is reasonable. Not advocating for people to not ask or work for money, but for experience if internship is structured well can be very beneficial."
81,"@daliakatan @thegoleffect @lennysan @haloincubator Yes will DM you to meet up.  And sending you partner offers. Don't have @Superhuman on the list, and i pay full price myself .. hmm we'll look into contacting them for a partnership :)"
82,"@daliakatan @thegoleffect @lennysan @daliakatan have a bunch of free stuff/discounts via @haloincubator that you can take advantage of including aws, notion, 1password etc (though I realize your post is for founders in their first year). And ps, in miami all month, let’s meetup."
