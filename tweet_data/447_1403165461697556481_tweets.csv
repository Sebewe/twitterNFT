30,@TRF_Stories Marketplace platforms should be held accountable for most of the art fraud that's currently taking place. Improving the artist KYC process would help ensure authenticity of the work. Providing escrow services on high value pieces would give the buyer time to validate the work.

48,"@frankkozik @Frank_defitank 2) Custom smart contract mechanics necessary to facilitate even the most basic collectibles NFT sale are not supported by marketplaces.  Basic mechanics like random minting, delayed reveal, and pre-sale access would require custom development work."

1) Provenance of the NFTs and the smart contracts will forever point back to the Opensea marketplace on the blockchain"
