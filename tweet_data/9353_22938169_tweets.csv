4,"@CraigBurel @graphprotocol We allow users to deploy their own Graph nodes and subgraphs at the @SettleMintCom platform. Public, Testnet, and Enterprise networks for @ErigonEth (ETH), @avalancheavax , @BinanceChain, @0xPolygon and on the enterprise side for @HyperledgerBesu and soon Polygon Edge."

7,@AndersTbjornsen @alcuadrado @HardhatHQ How is it different from hardhat-deploy?
8,"@kelsos86 @LefterisJP @rotkiapp Yeah, using something like https://t.co/glU0Nge5Hk could help, but I agree a local dev machine is definitely easier"
9,@LefterisJP @kelsos86 @rotkiapp You can build those on GHA though right?
10,@peter_szilagyi @rakyll Ofcourse having a billion weirdly tagged versions out in the world is a problem too
11,"@peter_szilagyi @rakyll I notice that with a lot of projects, actual artefact creation (docker containers etc) is not done on PR’s. (cost reasons?) Which makes any emergency fixes anyone could do on their own, either very difficult, or the responsibility of the maintainer."

20,"@jandedobbeleer Really? Have it in the queue, guess I’ll be morning it up"
21,Ha! Some of these NFT public sales are insane 🤪 sell out in 3 minutes. Only way to win here is to write bots. Still I got https://t.co/mLXZSY8MKY from @LooksRareNFT and will spend some time riding up a bot

24,I hate how much time I lose every week because a) projects don’t lock their dependencies and b) projects break fundamental things in patch releases 😤
25,@Kamal_Kharmach Weer erg leuk gedaan 👌
26,"Hmm,@githubstatus claims everything is ok, but I’m very sure GHA has issues, no workers to pick up jobs it seems"

32,"@UndeadPastelNFT @ensdomains @opensea Damn, now I need a DAO to pay out his allowance… 😂 @MichellePlur didn’t you do something like that years ago?"
33,"@UndeadPastelNFT @ensdomains @opensea Any recommendations for youth friendly discord, telegram, etc groups, and similar must follows on social?"
34,"If anyone tells you people are not ready for Web3, think again. Spent the weekend with my son (early teen) setting up wallets, a cool @UndeadPastelNFT profile pic, an @ensdomains name and countless hours talking about what he found on @opensea and what it means."
35,@UndeadPastelNFT @VeerArend
36,@Toon God yes 👏
37,I should own this tweet @lensprotocol #digitalroots sig:0x2c698fdb78e5d59715f272b73a0e4f5bb920dbf87916d1fdb33eb270493797ed296d9828f6178e48bffd6aaeb13d29d915b3aadfb729369cd04c1dee6fb57b571b https://t.co/7mQpiwMhSW

41,"RT @clemlak: Thrilled to announce Marmite: a hassle-free Hardhat plugin to compare gas cost among different Solidity code snippets, let's g…"
42,"@IthronKoen @chr1stophe @itpocket Nice one! Also liked the low-code bit, first time someone lists exactly the drawbacks we are trying to avoid in building our platform 👌"
43,Why doesn’t the @Twitter macOS app load tweets in the background anymore? The pull to refresh thing is annoying and pin to top is not what I want.
44,"If you do anything this week, read https://t.co/8Xv1gZH3i6 by @gillesdc One of the clearest explanations of the future of the internet I’ve read in a long time. Hard to not be exited about web3!"
45,"@Tesla So, how is your Sunday going, I’m stranded at the side of the road as my replacement @volvocars now also has a 12v battery problem and refuses to drive… #fml"
46,"Damn, my 12v battery died over night. MX towed to the SC on a flatbed. Great roadside assistance service from @Tesla and the towing company btw, got a brand new Volvo v60 replacement car to use while they sort it out. But holy hell, would never go back to an ICE again…"
47,"@Amxx Never mind, I see they are taken from the npm module of openzeppelin-contracts"
48,@Amxx could you shine some light on how you develop in https://t.co/cilqJDjwkB ? I can't seem to find how to get the ABI's so I can codegen and have e.g. the ../../generated/accesscontrol/AccessControl import working
49,@calanais @SettleMintCom Fabric smart contract sets are coming either end of this month or early next.
50,@ashlarmarketing @Pieterjanvl Wat is dat ongeveer? 500 btw ex?
51,@Pieterjanvl @ashlarmarketing Tot op heden is een model 3 de goedkoopste goede. De superchargers en de jaren voorsprong in techniek maken het verschil. Niet goedkoop wel.
52,"@ashlarmarketing @Pieterjanvl Ja, hoorde van iemand laatst dat zelfs kleine autos allemaal heel duur geworden waren"
53,"@antonarhipov Give https://t.co/XCbHIiI7ye a whirl, having a great experience tbh. Same or better quality results, no ads."
54,"@ashlarmarketing @Pieterjanvl Belastingaftrek is natuurlijk wel een enorm verschil, maar dat moet je ook eerst verdienen voor je het kan aftrekken"
55,"@ashlarmarketing @Pieterjanvl TCO ja, maar je moet je cash flow ook in het oog houden. Lagere aankoopprijs en dus lagere lease per maand en af en toe een hogere kost is vaak haalbaarder. Ook komen de brokken vaak niet of op het einde van de lease."
56,"@Pieterjanvl 10-100-1000 auto’s bouwen kan iedereen (ale, auto bouwers hé), de stap naar een paar honderd duizend is veel moeilijker. Ik geloof dat Elon ooit een quote gaf in de trant van “een auto schalen is geen challenge van de techniek van de auto, maar van de supply chain”"
57,@stefanjudis @rauschma Got it: alias ls='exa -alsname --icons --group-directories-first --git -h'

99,@sudomichael @rothgar It is mostly the 4 billion spam / advertising messages that make me hate it.
