21,@negilchi @aryan_kochhar and it should be 👀
22,"@negilchi @aryan_kochhar discoverability would be handled by curators in this model, which I think would be more effective than search (for the reasons you've mentioned)

incentivizing curators &gt;= creators solves the problem of tagging/structure

humans are better than machines here"
23,"@aryan_kochhar 2/

nocode tooling for creators to design their own royalty &amp; attribution structures

(basically licensing as programmable NFT)"
24,"@aryan_kochhar 1/ needs:

suitable interface &amp; UX — probably Twitter minus likes

incentive layer — adding value to an good idea should be more valuable than copying &amp; reposting the idea... snowball effect

ecosystem of operators &amp; builders downstream to take snowball ideas to market"
25,"@negilchi @aryan_kochhar Both of those are downstream effects of UI/UX poorly suited for the desired outcome

Ideas need a meme-friendly platform

Twitter wins UI/UX here, but it's missing the incentive and attribution layer underneath"
26,"@shamikasmruthi @aryan_kochhar incentive structure should be designed in such a way that attribution is valued more highly than copying

i.e. layering value on good existing ideas is more valuable than ""original ideas""

leads to snowball effect

best ideas can be taken to market via ecosystem of builders"
27,"@DouglasBilly33 @aryan_kochhar Not necessarily, if you flip the incentive model to make attribution more valuable and more frictionless than copying

i.e. Quote Tweet &gt; Tweet"
