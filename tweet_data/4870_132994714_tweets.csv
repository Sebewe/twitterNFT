16,"@NFTsAnonymous Because I’m general, news outlets prefer to report about unplanned outcomes. Since WGMI is planned and business as usual, it’s not worthy of reporting."

23,"@Z_Felds @cclccl4461 Beautiful timepiece -- nice flex sneaking the rug in there too. I've dreamed of getting something like this - maybe someday. Would love ""an entry level"" ballers watch that would still be an impressive flex, need to do more research."

25,@turtle_rat Every time I refresh the howlerz twitter profile there's another 1k followers.
26,"@turtle_rat Yeah I'm not sure - first time using it for this type of thing. Probably faster to click on the tweet via PC through the tweetdeck push for me, that's my assumption."

28,@turtle_rat yeah just drinking a smoothie at my desk to be honest.

44,"@KrayTrain @3landersNFT @creatureNFT Yeah this is tough. I'm in a similar amount of discords and I've grouped some into a ""daily"" group of projects that seem to be offering the most collabs and giveaway opportunities. Even on busy days I try to go through the announcements slowly/methodically to max my chances."
