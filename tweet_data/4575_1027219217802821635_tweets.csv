27,@FudderVerse I bought this NFT with the expectation of a zero floor. Was so close as we were at .03. Now we’re at .13! This is not what I was expecting. Can we start pulling the rug? Company seems to be missing the mark on its original vision. #NGMI https://t.co/bK0Gim0Ucj

42,"@nothinbutbangrs Yeah man. There's a lot of potential for these. Allows ppl to creatively design their galleries however they see best. And yeah, some of the serial and sigs are slowly being updated on OpenSea it seems."
43,"@nothinbutbangrs Some of the Autograph “signatures”don’t seem to be displaying yet, Heals on Wheels included. And you’re right! I wish there was an area I could showcase a 1x individual NFT bc Heals on Wheels is more than worthy when it displays properly! Gotta think how to incorporate it 🤔 💭"
