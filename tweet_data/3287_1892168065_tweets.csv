1,@Spotonparts @knowyourhorses Are you referring to the perfection scores?

6,@jjonlee @cortez_crypto How many races do you think it should take for a horse (post-discovery) to ease into wherever they actually belong?
7,"@PonyZook @kkirk55 @jjonlee @cortez_crypto But I am also one of many, many users. As long as the system works for the majority of users, it’s a good system!"
8,@PonyZook @kkirk55 @jjonlee @cortez_crypto I also have not raced since putting all of my horses through discovery. It just doesn’t make sense to

28,@CMRidinDerby @senor_mex @PonyZook @knowyourwallet Only downside right now are the queue times. Only one race runs at a time
29,@senor_mex @PonyZook I pretty much just started racing today. Only had a handful of races when racing was last opened liket wo days ago

39,@Stanley_Studios I don't really play anymore
40,@Stanley_Studios I'm surprised there having issues executing tbh. That's what surprises me!
41,I bought Cool Pets because I wanted to bet on the ecosystems of the already established projects. Maybe the botched drop should have been the sign to stay away...

Talents are going to be what really separates it from other racing games, but they're still working on that!"
47,"@cortez_crypto @bitlovincom They're humming along very nicely! Not quite ready for public racing yet, but developing and progressing at a very steady pace. Very, very clear with communicating progress and hiccups

I got in with the second wave of beta users, I'm also looking to satisfy my racing itch"

There’s always this looming feeling that you’re not innovating fast enough (especially in a space that evolves faster than any other) which leads to many late nights

82,"Eventually there will come a time where we as consumers aren’t competing directly for NFTs, but brands are competing for our attention and will compensate us through some use of fungible and non-fungible tokens

83,"As more BRANDS try to capture your attention, they won’t be rewarding you with “fake internet money.” They’ll be rewarding you with collectibles that align with their brand, style, and vision

85,"How do these organizations get more digital participation? Incentivize people to watch their events on TV

The NBA All-Star weekend is soon and @nbatopshot is rewarding people an opportunity to receive an NFT by tuning into select events

86,"All-Star weekend is known to be fairly meh across all sports. The Pro Bowl is worse than two-hand touch, the NBA All-Stars somehow play even less defense than they usually do, I personally only watch the home run derby when MLB All-Star rolls around

87,"When we move from the physical to the digital world, we need to move from physical collectibles to digital collectibles (NFTs)
