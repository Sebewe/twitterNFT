45,"@magdalenakala Also, the narrative right now is ""How to PROFIT on NFTs"", until all the cryptobros and twitter algo chasers stop pushing that, it is going to be next to impossible to convince the average person to hold an NFT that brings THEM individual value vs. market value."

64,@JWLevitt I would look at @apexoptimizers . It’s an NFT that is built around a health and human performance community. Could be a good way to dip your toe in. Otherwise just set and forget it and keep doing the recurring crypto buys.
