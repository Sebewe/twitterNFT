But I do think it’s smart to prepare for the worst and at least save some of your worth in crypto. Just in case, you know, the US turns into a communist country and the dollar goes to $0. Just in case"
98,"@Tourfaint @321bsbd @Stormsurfer83 @Shashan15378205 @Dapz_24 I think that’s part of the point. Imagine having the opportunity to leave and start a new life somewhere else. Many in Venezuela never had that chance before their $ was worth $0. Let’s say it can be seized, but still a better chance at leaving and starting a new life somewhere."
