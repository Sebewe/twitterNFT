14,@Helloimmorgan @DogecoinJon @__SeriousGemini How’s this one rank? https://t.co/pXzQEt3Or6
15,"@DogecoinJon @__SeriousGemini @Helloimmorgan Yes, that is a jpg, not a NFT. Feel free to fill your hard drive with them."
16,"@DogecoinJon @Helloimmorgan Yeah, and you acknowledge them as gross food pics, not as actual gross food you could pick up and eat. Same distinction needs to be made for NFT. If you want to give them a different name, call them web apps. But referring to a small app as a jpg is silly"
17,"@Helloimmorgan @DogecoinJon You totally own that copy of that jpg, but it’s still not a NFT"
18,"@DogecoinJon @Helloimmorgan If you take a pic of some gross food and send it to someone, you send them a pic of some gross food. You didn’t send them actual gross food. Same concept"
19,@DogecoinJon @Helloimmorgan What does? The things that aren’t NFT?
20,@DeadCaitBounce I like to say “I’m an adult” while eating ice cream for dinner. Fuck around and find out

29,"@0xfbifemboy Web 2 didn’t completely redo everything from scratch, it just added some async communication, standards, and frameworks. People keep trying to use one tool to do everything instead of finding the right solutions for the job. They’ll get there tho."
30,@tommychong That’s nice man. Did you know male moose are called bulls? And killer whales are a natural predator of moose.
31,"@0xfbifemboy Crypto should be used to add value to games, not entirely replace every aspect of modern games. A layer of asset ownership, and an in-game currency that can be cashed out or used in other games. The rest can stay as it is."

47,"@_HumbleBeast_ Yeah? If they try to make crypto stuff more annoying, they’re just decreasing the relative value of their fiat. Want to be the world reserve currency? Then show up to the job. Don’t want to play because it’s too technical? You’re not a good reserve currency then, bye."

49,"@_HumbleBeast_ Announcements of one country shouldn’t impact crypto, it’s designed to be resistant to that sort of thing, and it’s global. The US thinks too much of itself in regards to their influence and role here."
