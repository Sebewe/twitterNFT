OK thanks ;)"
14,@Deckle_Edge @niyazi_gurgen Love this 😍
15,@sefayamak @richerd Yes pfp has bought huge amounts of liquidity to the nft space and without it we wouldn’t have different forms of art finding success.
16,@richerd Fine but don’t forget that pfp is art too. It’s just a victim of its own success and will find its level in time.
17,@J_BanksPhoto @nvlcllctr @Ukraine_DAO Dammit I was going to get that one. Very poignant signage in the background. Snooze I lose. Great pickup!

34,@FitzBorre @devrinusta GM bro!
35,@FitzBorre @devrinusta Appreciate that @FitzBorre I really believe this. If we can break down these 3rd parties that profit from keeping us divided there is no limit to what we can do.
36,@Art_via_lens @devrinusta Absolutely Kannan. In future they serve as a reminder to us in a very powerful way.
37,"What a great collection @devrinusta, thankyou for helping me to never forget these stories in time."
38,"As we move into web3  my hope is we find this again. Once 3rd party barriers are broken down we can communicate a vast array of thoughts without preconceptions, and allow dangerous ideas to break down 3rd party dogmas to see the light of day again."
39,"about desperation, resignation, love, anger, comradery, and most of all presence. Each face is coloured with authenticity. There were no cellphones, so wether we liked it or not we were all right there, in that moment together. And it was powerful."
40,"women on the streets. The rhymes from Nas, Tribe, Public Enemy, Pharcyde still talked about hope. They talked about about belief, that love and prosperity can be stolen and that's why it's worth fighting for. 

These images captured by @devrinusta each tell a little story"
41,"It was the 90's. Proud men and women of colour had stood together in decades before, resilient in defiance against entrenched dogmas.

52,@FDilekUyar To be sure you have the option of un-approving access. But by the sounds it is not ongoing and the reports of $200 million of NFTs was false.

54,"@Deckle_Edge @FDilekUyar Yes looks like phishing associated with a scam email link. I retweeted an update thread, they are investigating now."

66,"🚨DO NOT migrate your Opensea portfolio to the new contract!🚨

There is an exploit and a number of accounts have been drained. 🙏"
67,@Deckle_Edge @Artifaction2 This is one of the most beautiful images ever created IMO.
68,@JamesFromFACT @TheJayKyren @megbatphoto Yes! :)😀🤌🎉
69,"@TheJayKyren @megbatphoto Such a crucial point to be aware of Jay as many coming in will bring web2 ‘me first’ ideas to this new marketplace, so for them to understand they can grow long term wealth and contribute to web3 is so important."
70,@TheJayKyren @megbatphoto The less centralised our curated apps and platforms are the better. my hope is that the future isn’t dominated by an algorithmic solution. If we turn the current paradigm of ‘viewer as the product’ to the product itself as the real thing being sold then web3 wins.
71,@TheJayKyren @megbatphoto As long as we can avoid falling into centralised traps from here I think the market has become mature enough to handle the range. Will definitely make the better art shine brighter :)
72,@TheJayKyren @megbatphoto Many known IG influencers will sell their images no doubt. The plus side is bringing another market layer which will make all artists here now into a layer 1 of genuine OG’s. Also will bring fiat money and the crowd to interact with crypto.
