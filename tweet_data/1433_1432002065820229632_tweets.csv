6,My Twitter feed is starting to feel like everyone is doing Flat Stanley with @VitalikButerin. Thanks for being a good sport man
7,"Instead of throwing shade at @opensea, get smart on security. 91% of security breaches start with phishing emails. And that’s Web2. If you’re going to have a meaningful wealth in crypto/NFTs spend some time learning how to be safe. Start by checking senders and links closely."
8,Looks the upstairs door to my @RTFKTstudios LootPod just opened up. Feels like #metaverse multiplayer is just around the corner..... https://t.co/DU44jrzIqy
9,"Picked up 2 @nftworldsNFT 🌎s today. Couldn't ignore the @Minecraft link any longer. Once 140M+ Minecraft players realize they can make money ($WRLD) doing the same thing, it's going to be a creator/builder frenzy. Plus @RTFKTstudios has a 🌎 too. #CloneX takeover https://t.co/zVMQnZxLOo"
10,"I think sometimes we forget that @opensea built us all an #NFT marketplace BEFORE all the HYPE. I'm a fan of competition from the likes of @LooksRareNFT and @the_x2y2, but let's remember that OS helped put NFTs on the map. All us degens would still have LinkedIn PFPs without them"

30,"Rule 5: Be suspicious of links. If someone sends you a shortlink, try a shortlink expander. Better still is to get the name of the website and google it, and then click on the link in Google. It’s much harder to fool Google than it is to send a spoofed link."
31,"Rule 4: Get a hardware wallet
Yes, it’s that important. Items stored in hardware wallets are more difficult to steal than items stored in browser wallets, because hardware wallets keep your private keys “offline” as long as the device isn’t plugged in to your computer."
32,Rule 3: Read rule 2 again.
33,"Rule 2: Never, ever, ever, EVER, give your seed phrase to someone on the internet
Doesn’t matter if the person says they’re from a project’s Support Team. Doesn’t matter. DO. NOT. GIVE. YOUR. SEED. PHRASE. OUT. OVER. THE. INTERNET. EVER. Get it? Got it? Good."
34,"Rule 1: Backup your seed phrase
You should think of your seed phrase as being “your money”. If you were the sole keeper of your money, would you just write down the secret password in one place? Hell no. Write it down in at least two different secure offline places."
35,"#Clones keep Clones safe...

@RTFKTstudios CloneX Fam, as we continue to 🚀 to the 🌙, it's important that we don't turn into targets like other blue chips. Be smart, protect your precious clones, and follow some simply rules 👇"
36,"New to @RTFKTstudios? A primer:
In 2021, you buy RTFKT @fewocious shoe for $3K
Now:
- 👟 = 4.5ETH + you ⚒️ physicals + 1 free 👟
- 1 free 👟 = 2.7E
- 2 👟 🔓 6 Clones = 108E
- 6 👱 🛬 6 Pods = 24E
- 2 Mintdisc = 2.4E
- 6 👱 + 6 🏠 get 12 🛬s =? 
That $3K is now &gt;= 142ETH = $400K"
