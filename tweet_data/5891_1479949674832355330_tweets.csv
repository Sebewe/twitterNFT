10,@0xphiuchus @DANNYw3rains @FilipZaruba1 i agree its stunning. i was only asking cause so many ash projects are stunning so its hard to choose with limited funds haha. so im really trying to dive deep into every aspect of each project!
11,"@FilipZaruba1 @DANNYw3rains Im new to the space so i hear a lot about utility like is this nft the first of ur collection. Is it going to evolve and change? Is it like dels new piece that we collect and fuse and stuff like a game. So more like general info I guess, i read the website a little"

19,"@AB84 @boredpunksnft I personally dont mind these rug pull nft projects hiring influencers like AB. I mean if I saw AB promoting a project like this, I would immediately know its a rug pull, so thank you for all the influencers like AB, lana rhodes, logan paul help expose projects like this…LOOL"

22,"@CutifredE @Cassis892 LOL, very skeptical now..so.. imma leave it as that haha"
23,"@YakuzaDaddy I saw that they were minting IF, after a brief amount of thinking I thought it, I thought it was legit and bought it with my burner wallet. I soon learned that scammers can find a way to make it look like tracked wallets are minting. So make sure you always double check!"
24,"@YakuzaDaddy I got scammed recently and minted a fake IF two weeks ago. I knew it was a hype project and kept a eye on it. One weekend, I woke up and was following wallet activity from some big players like Gary Vee, pranksy etc."

41,"@tansanDOTeth yea, its all about risk. I've personally been trying to sell my NFT's I dont have too much conviction for and moving into more p2e game nfts. For example, I hold metroverse, bloodshed bears, yakuza, etc. Farming stables on the side, and making sure i have yield on whatever i own"
42,@Charlie14061326 @AzukiZen 😈😈😈
43,@tansanDOTeth No but i would recommend selling any NFT’s you feel like might not last thru a bear market. War just creates bear markets because of the uncertainty. Think of these NFT projects as a business. Which do you think has the most liquidity and can sustain hype thru beat markets?
