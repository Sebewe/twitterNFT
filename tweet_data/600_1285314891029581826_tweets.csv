Pls sers mi familia…"
1,@GuidoDisalle @NFT_NYC I think you had to apply. Probably still open.
2,@Lakoz_ @NFT_NYC Bro they have @Bitboy_Crypto speaking lmao
3,Gonna tell my kids this was the @NFT_NYC speaker list https://t.co/NBVVvz60nv

5,"Metaverse NFTs seem to have been the only bright spot, managing to hold on to a small gain on the month: https://t.co/ETOD248hB6"
6,"Monthly @nansen_ai NFT Index performance... not great

Bluechips, social, and gaming all down over the last 30 days in both ETH and USD terms. Will spare you the chart of the Art index which is down 39%. https://t.co/KrH1jJ06NW"

11,"Kinda crazy to think that if you bought Bitcoin a year ago today you would be down 4-5% since then. 

ETH on the other hand… 😍"
12,"@r0seNY @DrifterShoots Might be your lucky day, it’s implied valuation on fractional is only 44e"
13,"@DrifterShoots @SuperRare Everyone can own a piece of this beauty via @fractional_art: https://t.co/CXkqrhuNCk

14,RT @DrifterShoots: Everlasting https://t.co/cMgwCmlFxH
15,Kinda not seeing any IF as pfps… is that because they’re animated?
16,gm! https://t.co/VVqDIMjmGg
17,"@Debussy100 Yeh order online. They insure the shipping so you gucci in transit. Unless you’re buying a lot, I would say $50k worth of coins are the size of an empty toilet paper roll so it’s easy to secure in a safe at home if you want."
18,@Debussy100 I sold my physical gold for NFTs this time last year lol think might reverse the trade now. I use JM Bullion out of Texas.
19,"Not going to be bear posting through March since nobody likes a negative Nancy… having said that, I will just ask everyone to please be careful in these markets. We’ve got a nuclear power’s currency in freefall and a ugly nascent war. Good luck and good night."

30,@TedsLittleDream @farokh I would if I had one……..
31,"Wearing my BAYC at Soho House in Meatpacking with @farokh, no one has said anything about it. No eye contact, nothing. I keep looking around but nobody notices. Idk what’s happening. Can devs do something?"

34,"@santiagoroel Certainly moving in the right direction, that’s for sure."
35,"@0xTjo @KenWattana It’s OK, Yuga is in contact with the SEC! Gary too busy for Coinbase but he certainly has time to give guidance on $APE 👍🏼"
36,@santiagoroel It really does depend on where you’re starting from. I had to grind at banks for years to get visa sponsorship when I would’ve rather taken a risk at a startup instead.
37,"@GuidoDisalle You know me, if you can’t join them beat them"
38,@cryptomonsterlb OMG this is something else hahah
39,@megs_io Generative projects/games/membership tokens
40,@head_mug Depends on number of items but for 10k ~ 0.08-0.1
41,"Bit over a year in NFTs and few things are clearer than the power of low mint price as an indicator of the creator’s belief in the future of their project. Idc who you are, a low mint price tells me you understand the power of secondary royalties and are invested for the future."
42,@DarthJotaro *CryptoPunk ☝️
43,@multivrsstudios Wait what if our $APE airdrop comes with a free Tesla since @elonmusk met with @moonpay and so then we would never need gas again! 🧠
44,What if $APE is a thing we can all smoke to get the same kind of hallucinations that BAYC holders experience when thinking about $APE? 💨 🍄 https://t.co/BzzXpiSmON
45,@economist Ser i was promised $250k per ape per annum on a relative value versus where Disney and $DOGE trade
46,"gm… coming up on the anniversary of the @Grimezsz cash grab drop on @niftygateway last year and I can’t stop thinking how the legacy music industry has mostly so far fumbled the great opportunity that NFTs present as they relate to connecting artists, experiences and fans. https://t.co/ma4b2MMryM"

61,@fvckrender @NonFungibleNoah He’s a man of the people! No nepotism here. I approve.
62,@mb__nft Not saying he doesn’t! Just amazing to watch the power of web3 vs old institutions
63,So Noah is gonna make more off NFT secondaries in a day than Christie’s did in all of 2021? 🤣😂
64,Yoooooo!! Told y’all it was Music NFT day for me! Who’s listening to Faces on repeat?!? 🎶 https://t.co/Opp0kXiR4E
65,@samjstudios i'm too hot for hot coffee
66,PSA: if you felt sick to your stomach from seeing the NFT dip and not just the war images two nights ago you’re overexposed. The market bounced back quickly but please read @osf_nft’s thread on managing risk and make sure you’re setup to potentially ride a longer dip.

68,@ABigThingBadly Yo I work at Fireblocks. We have 800+ institutional clients. Happy to chat about the best setup for any use case of institutional self-custody.
69,@crowdturtle just experienced that last week with Chase and United.. such a headache.. ended up having to buy points to pay for fare diff on the change bc they wouldnt take USD for some reason given original ticket was purchased with pts.

73,gm... woke up in a music NFT kinda mood after interviewing @RAC for @RealVision yesterday (video out in March!) and found myself lost in the beauty of @omgkirbyDAO's Genesis pieces.

85,@0xfoobar Ser the LL marketplace doesn’t serve you champagne
86,"Fact: @Sothebys is now 0/3 for NFT secondary auctions. 

They failed at “Punk it”.
They pulled the twitter “charity” auction.
The “natively digital 2.0” saw consigners buy each other lots. 

Nothing against the great people who work there but y’all’s model does not work for NFTs."

Always willing to give people second chances and the benefit of the doubt…
