1,"@Foamform1 @gt_dog84 @opensea You don't need to sign in on etherscan, just click ""Connect to web3"". Then go to the 2nd tab and click sort on contracts/show all contracts or something like that, it then lists all approved nft contracts"
2,"@GemmaSm41116933 Just do the expensive ones, check your portfolio on https://t.co/RFfnydWCYA to see which ones you need to delist because you don't want to lose them"
3,"@Foamform1 @gt_dog84 @opensea No best do it through etherscan: https://t.co/BsI0SVOJrH
It doesn't show it if they're revoked or not so you have to remember which ones you already revoked. Bad UI but it works"

7,"@Badsonofmarz A lot if #WomenInNFTs right now. I can def recommend @HunnysNFT , as well as @ArcanaRue and #SoulCafe . #Hunnys is by far the most colourful and fun, so it is my favourite to look at :)"
8,@therennverse @HunnysNFT @HetzDoge @CMuheize @cryptostacys Wow that toad!
9,"@GirlfrieNFTs @HunnysNFT Imo the platform to be for P2E is the WAX blockchain, I've been there myself for a year now and because it has no gasfees it is perfect for onchain games (as well as beginners because gas sucks). It is very different from Eth though, both in market and people.
