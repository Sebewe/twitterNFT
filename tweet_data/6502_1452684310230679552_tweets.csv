Set a reminder below so you can be there when we make history! 

https://t.co/4l0VIjIM4O"
94,"My debut track, “Number”, outlines heartbreak, betrayal and how hard it is to trust after being stabbed in the back. It accurately represents everything I was feeling at the time of my first big break up. https://t.co/0sJsStQ4jm"
95,"This year has been the best and it’s just begun. I’ve met my heroes, received unique opportunities and made music that I’m proud of!

I’d like to thank the team at @soundxyz_ for giving me this chance. I’m amazed at their work to shift the landscape and give artists a new option."
96,"My aspirations for the future are to learn and grow as an artist. I love soaking up information, taking on new perspectives and meeting new people within the space. I value being a good learner over everything because listening to others leads to more clarity and understanding. https://t.co/kLhAgaJAIV"
97,"Last year I took the dive into the world of crypto, NFTs and smart contacts. I quickly learned that there is a lot to web3. But as time went on, I became involved with communities like @soundxyz_ and @dreamsnevrdie and I started to feel like I had a place in the web3 ecosystem. https://t.co/Kbvjf94VTt"
98,"Uncertainty has defined every stage of my journey as a young musician. My music never fell into a consistent category for the longest time, leaving me feeling lost and unstable. I bounced between EDM, Pop and Hip Hop for years until I found the SLOE JACK sound."
99,"I’ve been writing music seriously for about 4 years, but my experiences with production go way back. Bass producers like Skrillex and Flux Pavilion were the reasons I first installed a DAW. I remember being curious as to how their songs were made without any physical instruments. https://t.co/UjfpDSAMBs"
