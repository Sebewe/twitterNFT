Show me another project doing that. I bet on shit like this. and i never miss"
14,"@GoTrillaGorilla @boredapex @BYOPills Their initial roadmap said 2 things:

1. 2 weeks away from an AR filter where you could trip your vision

2. In-game consumables, metaverse ready (and everything about the pills)

ELO should just be fixed, don't need to try and incentivize people to go where they ""should"" it should happen w gaming algos, take this out of the user's decision tree"
36,"@PonyZook @BootsInTheBooth @jjonlee @cortez_crypto seems like the entire ELO model is broken then. Not the discovery process

The model should be able to figure out which horses are weak and rocketship them back to the right class. It shouldn't look anything like model, it shouldn't take weeks, barely days."

39,"@BootsInTheBooth @jjonlee @cortez_crypto Right, I imagine that most people won’t waste more than 5-7 races before giving up if it’s not super efficient point model

@jjonlee horses in C1 that belong in C5 should get there very quickly (5-10 races). How do we make that happen?"
40,"@shannisuissa @DentedFeelsNFT Wow! What a trip. I’ve spent almost the same time down there but different countries. Brazil is at top of my list.

Or we do a full Dented backpacking squad trip 🧠 💡"
41,"@jjonlee I’ve just started running all of my horses (hundreds to run).

I already have some that can’t help but win in discovery despite being weak. Will share more as it progresses"
42,"Good point here @bg_alt and @zed_run family, do we have any data or anecdotes of weak horses in higher classes from discovery? 

How quickly do they go backwards? Are you willing to spend those races losing? https://t.co/nOU3dMswM2"
