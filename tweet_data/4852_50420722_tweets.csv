24,"@znfrey Me thinking I explain it for non techies, me actually ⬇️ https://t.co/a3Ju8eJvxm"
25,"13/13 If your NFT is stored locally, doesn't mean you got scammed, or it will not grow. But reviewing the contract can save future headaches. Also, save the certificate info -on that link- and while at it right-click save your JPG😅"
26,"12/13  I try to evaluate: community, team, art, utility, contract, marketing, metrics, my budget, and my values. In this case, I don't think a regular member would have gotten the same treatment if scammed and that just hits on my core value of equality. Making it a no for me."
27,"11/13 While it was well-intentioned, the point of NFTs being stored on the blockchain is the immutability (never changes). But if a project leader changes your NFT at any time, what's the difference with an overhyped web2 community? 🤔 I decided not to buy this one."
28,"10/13 I thought most projects were stored using IPFS as a standard and I almost buy one without reviewing this. That night an influencer got their NFT stolen and the project leaders changed the NFT picture to another picture with a message saying ""Do Not Buy This"" 🚩"
29,"9/13: 🚩 OFF CHAIN: LOCALLY STORED: the most centralized way. The link starts with https:// and it's stored on their website. This is not good practice because in case the project stops existing or stops renewing their domain, your NFT (certificate and image) can get lost."
30,"8/13 ⭐️ OFF CHAIN: MIXED: It points to a local link on their website and inside that page, there is an ipfs link (usually means only the image is stored on ipfs and not the attributes or certificate)."
31,7/13 ⭐️ ⭐️ OFF CHAIN: IPFS:  InterPlanetary File System. Say What? The link starts with ipfs:// (example BAYC). This is off-chain but it's immutable (doesn't change) and it's decentralized (not stored in just one place) https://t.co/cDkBwpMCFE
32,"6/13 ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ON CHAIN: stored directly on the blockchain. You get an encrypted base64 encoded json data. Say what? Let's say this is the purest option closest to the NFT definition. This is not common because it has limitations, can't store big files, and has higher gas fees."
33,"5/13 Here is where you find out if your NFT image is stored on chain or off chain. And if it's using a decentralized protocol or a centralized server. There are 4 options, let's rate them ⬇️"
34,"4/13 Pick the Read option and search for tokenURI, (usually at the end) add the NFT number on tokenId for the one you are evaluating, then click on Query. https://t.co/xpz9oYsh7i"
35,"3/13  We are re-directed to Etherscan, it doesn't have to be intimidating, once you understand it's like reading a novela. For now: Go to contract https://t.co/65fAn6LThq"
