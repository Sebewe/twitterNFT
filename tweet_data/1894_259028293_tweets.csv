27,@kimcheeandgrits I just don’t think crypto freeze achieves anything impactful.
28,"@saadiq @bvdahl Because crypto is meant to be decentralized; the reality is much of it is not hence this is a possibility, but it’s a bad precedent to use crypto against its original ethos

Sanctions that directly hit cronies—exports, high net worth asset freezes— are more impactful than reg ppl"

48,"@digitallynativ @web A decade ago you could pull off a successful sub $1B IPO easily. What I'm hearing from the market today is, don't bother until you are $4-5B TEV"
49,"@digitallynativ @web Being a viable company is a necessary but not sufficient candidate to be a viable IPO candidate -- scale, preparedness (pre-IPO CFOs is a huge talent gap), readiness to get on quarterly expectations cycle, etc."

51,@digitallynativ @web I do 🙃
52,@digitallynativ @web The top ibankers I'm talking with now would disagree -- the size of IPO investors ballooned so even small cap funds need bigger chunks than an IPO size for a $150M brand (and you don't want to be an orphan with just retail buyers)
