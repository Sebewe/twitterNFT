0,@WomanNFT @AntoinetteIII1 @maxosirisart Glad you dig it! Here’s a link to the token with a much higher resolution image on @KnownOrigin_io https://t.co/xdras23v1I
1,One of my favorite collabs with @maxosirisart after he was banned from Known Origin so we collaborated on this mint for his unwelcome return https://t.co/vzHrYlMVpH https://t.co/UGAMm3wtDN
2,"@osf_nft I think 1:1’s and OG mints from KO in low editions are a good play alongside $RARE.  Lower liquidity in some artists, but quite a few will be in high  demand"
3,"@KeyboardMonkey3 This^…CryptoArt and 1:1’s are where it’s at. All sold out ATM, but more to come “METADEATH” only on @KnownOrigin_io https://t.co/uw0xnpAyXU https://t.co/yTd5bSvUqA"
4,@3LAU @opensea @sudoswap This is why it is is extremely important to mint from your own contract. If you create a minting contract you can set and control royalties on secondary markets like @opensea
5,@greatmando_nft @osf_nft Sent a DM about a unique on-chain project
6,Appears to be verified as authentic addresses to directly donate to @Ukraine and donations have doubled since verified sources! https://t.co/w6iYJCCkQT
7,"In times like these it means everything to see communities and the world come together to support our brothers and sisters in Ukraine. Nice to see  Crypto and CryptoArt communities’quick response, but always verify before donating to ensure funds are used to provide real support. https://t.co/X2qcQAeeRJ"
8,Come join in the conversation about nothing but TRASH! #trashart https://t.co/TnUB18Ltfg
9,@dan_sickles @thesarahshow Nice score and congratulations!
10,"@Reviiser I like one word with a capital A…CryptoArt, but the more variations the better. More decentralized https://t.co/WqKbJtAuZZ"
11,@TrashPainTycoon For open platforms @rarible on ETH and would definitely check out @manifoldxyz when gas is low for a custom contract
12,A fun way to sidestep centralized curation. I pay the gas and send 100% of the sales to the artists
13,May have to get back to this series of “THIS IS NOT JAY DELAY” … this awesome piece created by @Kerb “Gatekeepers of the Piece” and minted on my @makersplaceco account . #TRASHART https://t.co/7UsrLWJWsa https://t.co/0EMV6SEYyt
14,@anarchy_ecstasy @CozomoMedici @KnownOrigin_io Awesome! GM
15,"@anarchy_ecstasy @CozomoMedici @KnownOrigin_io No need to be embarrassed, artists are influenced by the culture and time they live in .  Similar ideas will propagate all over sometimes without awareness of each other’s existence. Cool MetaDeath piece. I bet there are more out there in all different styles, or will be soon."
16,@CozomoMedici You should pick up some #TRASHART Or my latest 1:1 “METADEATH” on @KnownOrigin_io https://t.co/uw0xnpAyXU https://t.co/FcwiRmhDfL
17,@CollinsCustomIP @ajpratt56 Congratulations! Hope you and the fam are doing well and enjoy the beautiful new baby boy!
18,"@CryptoTonyaZ @opensea Kinda miss the early days of @rarible, fun times"
19,"If you love #TRASHART, experiments in decentralized curation, and DAO’s check out @Trash_DAO Really stoked to get the opportunity to work with the @sznsNFT team and collaborate on some TRASH with @bitttylabs https://t.co/aPinSsooqy"
20,"@xCryptochild @tomkysar @SmithSatoshi @bitttylabs @berkozdemir @punk_cipher Love it! Your contributions to SPAM inspired and led to the development of @RATSswap, I’ve collected a few others in my other wallet"
21,"Fresh Mint and it’s been a minute since I minted a 1:1 
“METADEATH” only available on @KnownOrigin_io https://t.co/uw0xnpAyXU https://t.co/3iT3BFgnIF"

23,@TrashPainTycoon GM
24,@Reviiser @DivineDragonNFT Congratulations on the launch and killer work! 🔥
25,"@ramblemouth @punk6529 I’m no expert in VR, but a lot of CryptoArtists seemed to flock towards @cryptovoxels and they are at great prices RN"
26,@Vibinmyman @ProfessorJun_ @GuaranteedMoist @TrashPainTycoon @HYPEPULSENFT @spacedivers @xCryptochild @CollinsCustomIP This is how TRASH Is made 🔥 🔥
27,Hope everyone is sharing the love or not sparing the love on themselves for those flying solo! https://t.co/XvA1kfrUuN
28,"RT @Trash_DAO: Happy V Day! 

TRASH ART cred: @Jay_Delay https://t.co/GqhjFNbPAh"
29,"@iH0DL @ensdomains @opensea I’ve got a few projects lined up, and have slowed down on minting to focus more on creating …Got a collab with @bitttylabs dropping soon for a DAO that I’m really excited about. https://t.co/mERjK80PSK"
30,As a trader I’m trying to get better at Selling the News. So I present my @ensdomains for sale on @opensea https://t.co/CgSoqBeP2A https://t.co/vueasVIbaE
31,"@gulbakanozge @opensea @Gavin_nft @CollinsCustomIP @CryptoMarcobro @SirWilliamEth @SBeg2084 @Vince_Van_Dough @BlockGeekDima @EmpressTrash @StellasBot Good stuff, loving the style and the TRASH"
32,@ericprhodes @secondrealm Woah Awesome! I forgot I even had this listed and thought I had delisted all my early mints…glad it went to your collection
33,I hear some people are dropping the .eth or ENS...what are y’all picking up $NMC @Namecoin? The Original Altcoin that planted the roots for NFTs and ENS?
34,@jamie247 Someone needs to do this and Take my ETH before I buy more jpegs
35,@CollinsCustomIP Unfortunately I don’t think a lot of these contracts even support royalties
36,@Ef_ex @CollinsCustomIP @robnessofficial Totally forgot about this piece which may be one of my favorite screenshots of a Google Image Search and I’ve done quite a few using that technique https://t.co/YQViGYLYI1
37,"The 2019 Golden Age of Gifting NFTs , CryptoArt Airdrops and #SPAMART! @CollinsCustomIP set up pools if you missed out the first time https://t.co/kuPdaFmsZH"
38,"@osf_nft Understand the feeling, but also so many people calling a top at this point has me feeling like y’all are stuck in 2017"
39,Curation is often used to  lift voices in power and silence the minority. It is past time we collectively sing in unity to celebrate our shared heritage. In honor of #BlackHistory I want to share one of my favorite artists Thornton Dial https://t.co/ec0FluUhPN #TRASHART
40,Fresh TRASH ART Mint only on @rarible “LAMBOS ARE TRASH” ...A Narcissistic Bull Gets Lost in His Own Reflection In A Wavering Pink Illusion of Sucess. Welcome to the NFT Space @Lamborghini! https://t.co/ZNb2oVSGb8 https://t.co/BQifXD6LjJ
41,@carlosmarcialt Lambos are TRASH https://t.co/4lg4CUXafH
42,"@aljaparis @opiumhum Curation  has historically been careful selection to promote one culture or ideal over another, and even recently is  often  mindless of its exclusions."
43,"I know Gas Wars draw hype for a NFT project, but couldn’t you create an NFT contract where high gas fees could not mint any NFTs? This would help level the playing field a bit during runs on mints."
44,"@kbometaverse I have so many Trash Cans and Toters at my house from bins, to steel cans, modern to vintage it is like MOMA up in here right now"
45,@zuvembee @annadrezen I see it in action everyday
46,@critical_doink @annadrezen Crypto just moves faster than traditional markets
47,@critical_doink @annadrezen Burned CDs usually aren’t but a lot of “collectors” edition Vinyl or CDs  were pitched as collectible investments along with almost every physical good that has a following. Buy this action figure... keep it in a box for 50 years and you might be sitting on a fortune...
48,"@critical_doink @annadrezen I understand this is an issue, but the same thing happened with vinyl records, cassette tapes, cds, vhs and every reproducible format. Again the problem isn’t the tech...any medium can be used in this manner."
49,#trashart https://t.co/DJN1Yj2VWx
50,@critical_doink @annadrezen Yeah that sounds like a scam...Wait are we talking about the Stock Market or a Sotheby’s auction of Abstract Expressionism?
51,@critical_doink @annadrezen People were stealing artists work before NFTs. This is not a problem created by NFTs. It is a technology just like anything else. Some people use email to connect some to scam.
52,"What is really heartbreaking is that if we pay artists, musicians, and creators directly how will advertisers and Web2 platforms make money off of our data and ideas? https://t.co/up4rxpuo4E"
53,"@LeonidasNFT Mooncats, Crypto Stamps, MLB Champions, Editional Mints, Rare Pepes and    #TRASHART"
54,@annadrezen Yeah artists making automated royalties on every secondary sale is heartbreaking and being compensated directly for their content is asinine. All that money should benefit wealthy collectors and platforms not  the creators.
55,@ZiggyCrypto Some OGs who don’t get near enough respect
56,"I made a 5 Eth off a collectible flip and spent it all on artists that haven’t had a sale in a while. Not because of pity, but because y’all are sleeping on some GEMS."
57,What are you working towards in 2022? Im going to keep pushing for  the decentralization of curation and open sourcing of cultural phenomena combined with the absurdity of Art/Life  with the intensity of Defi https://t.co/euiR38R9r1
58,@bernardo_cafe Bitcoin 😆
59,Totally growing a mullet after watching this for the 5th time

62,"ELO don’t get enough respect for combining impressive songwriting skills with yacht rock, funk, disco, pop, and classical music... the strings, backup vocals with a sweet short breakdown, vocoder and futuristic vibe in 78’ https://t.co/VfTItKE0uG"
63,"@theYRDGZ @Crypto_Skulls Thanks! I’m trying to be optimistic in 22’ I’m not losing hair, I’m gaining forehead and showing off my skull 😆"
64,"Thought I had a nice stash of skulls but only picked up 1 and sold it a week ago. Good to be back, just picked up a bones brigade @Crypto_Skulls#wedigtheskulls #NewProfilePic https://t.co/bycgBYPZnf"
65,"@meganroseruiz Some people see an amazing opportunity for success and want to share that opportunity with an artist they respect. I have made more money in my time making NFTs than my combined  20
Years as an artist and musician."
66,@CozomoMedici Is there a roadmap or any utility that the Rothko foundation might add soon?
67,"@WizardX_0x Perhaps one of the most impressive modern art scams of the 20th Century. He  pretty much made a career out of painting two or three colors with a big brush , actually really impressive 😆"
68,@WizardX_0x To be fair they are more impressive in person https://t.co/sYeR6vAWDg
69,"@Ganymede_888 @aljaparis It can be a medium like a format like some musicians prefer to release vinyl or cassette over digital or CryptoArtists can use the NFT contract as a medium, where the creation of the token and contract is part of the artist’s intention and a creative tool"
70,@sassal0x @CryptoToad69 @RATSswap is a truly Decentralized CryptoArt Gallery/ NFT Swap
71,@aljaparis CryptoArt  is a movement NFTs  are a medium
72,"@artnome @BarbaraReardon9 As someone who microwaves potatoes, I find it impressive that someone would not only bake a potato 🥔 not just once, but twice! Welcome @BarbaraReardon9!"
73,@iH0DL These are awesome! Lovin the style
74,"@robnessofficial @Crypto_Skulls I’ve got a pinback button maker from playing in bands over the years, maybe I should dust it off"
75,"Wanted to get a v1 Cryptopunk back when MoonCats were Rescued. Now I’m considering leaving these alone, or at least watching the large bag holders dump and then let them get redistributed on the cheap....trying to hash out my collector mentality and morality. https://t.co/tpeV7hL84S"
76,"@luluixixix Sounds cool, but not as cool as 3.69"
77,@LEOS10301 No restrictions were placed on either
78,"@VladCrypto1313 Nothing wrong with wanting to take your Art and make Nfts, just a different background and approach. Nothing real or unreal about either."
79,@mimnermosart @oficinastk @j1mmyeth This piece may have actually been made in response to the “TRASHARTISTS ARE THE WORST PEOPLE IN NFTLAND” article by Jimmy
80,"@mimnermosart @oficinastk @j1mmyeth “U R TRASH”
https://t.co/8ktvxp7ifz https://t.co/OYW5TxUWVO"
81,"Some artists entering the space don’t like or are not used to the nature  of Crypto. Whereas CryptoArtists aren’t here for minting art on the Blockchain with “NFTs”. CryptoArtists are Crypto Natives interested in Crypto as a Medium of Exchange, both culturally and financially."
82,@Vibinmyman Maybe life came up and they will make it right. If not Life will Make it Right in the End
83,This is awesome next level Digital Trash and cool extension of an already cool series...#TrashArt https://t.co/vbWacbwXwB
84,@StandardPigeon @robnessofficial Sometimes they display  the #TRASHART in or near the Restrooms since those are high traffic areas
85,@KeyboardMonkey3 LFG! https://t.co/AWuKSkuCwC
86,When I say best performing I mean Best of the Worst in the part 24 Hours.
87,DON’T HOLD $RATS https://t.co/OJhGScUw59
88,@whal3iam @loomdart Could also be more sellers than buyers https://t.co/LSFfnaczRB
89,"@loomdart My thesis is now there are too many competitors, they have maxed out and now rely on being a content creator while at the same time NFTs will capture all the content"
90,What has been your best performing NFT or coin during this dump? So far mine has been @Namecoin one of the OG Altcoins where the roots for NFTs and @ensdomains began to grow
91,@MassimoMagee @jerrysaltz In that pile of crap often times the diamonds will be obscured and considered crap as well... in those moments @RATSswap
92,@SatsMoonSoon I’ll be better once I can get the answers on this Coinbase quiz right and earn $3 in Crypto
93,@CryptoNinjaco I got my video ready and already know the answers to the quizzes! https://t.co/QdyMuRcpLU
94,Anyone else going to try to time the bottom on Coin Base to maximize the $3 in crypto you can earn watching the videos? https://t.co/GbGiIo3D6p
95,@NathanHeadPhoto I try to pass on my stress equally to those around me so it’s not too much for me to handle...it’s not healthy to keep it all in https://t.co/zMJzfgppsk
96,@maxosirisart Seems legit. There is text and an image posted on the internet
97,"@JulzRoze I think there are similarities with scams and hype, although the cultural and adoption shift will be much larger with  NFTs ....so trading this market will be wildly different."
98,@xCryptochild Awesome idea! Love it
99,If you haven’t checked out @xCryptochild’s work yet he is a hardcore #trashartists and his new series shows his dedication to the art and cleans the beaches! https://t.co/83FCZ5lQQ3
