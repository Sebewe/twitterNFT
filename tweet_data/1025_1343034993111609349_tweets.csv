9,"de-risking today. converted 14.5Ξ to USD. weird ‘stuff’ going on in the NFT space with utter greed from these new “founders”.

market is LIQUID in JPGs and ILLIQUID in ETH.

..a little profit sounds 👌 right now.

still bullish long term on 1% of the projects."
10,@chrismaddern @ShadowQuest_NFT @floornfts woww. &amp;&amp; floor logo on the jacket 👀 sick.
11,@FlurETH can’t trust a guy that has 30 lions 🙊
12,@FlurETH that’s one strategy..
13,@EB7 agreed. if you’re building a business around the IP you should be able to generate revenue in other forms.
14,@talkaboutdesign I think SWIFT was the right move. tomorrow is going to be disastrous for their markets.
15,"@beaniemaxi hope we get a good evolution. the space itself is immature. this is typical. but we need to grow, and soon."
16,"precisely why we’re in trouble. everyone running to create their own project. it’s a fucken joke.

and those that aren’t sell out out for a free NFT or two in return for a retweet.

if we want this to be something why don’t y’ll stop creating projects and taking $2 for a tweet 👌 https://t.co/ymQU9GclH5"

30,@coldpizza_eth yo. 🍕 . we got a war here. look at the equity markets—it’s bloody. not just shit coins and our beloved “art”.
31,@NateAlexNFT “founders” creating projects and siphoning money out has become the norm for NFTers. too many people want to creat their own project—it’s weird. https://t.co/PrJOsaiL62

the amount of people launching projects is crazy

and their excuse for the project is pathetic. it’s for cash, just say it https://t.co/a0hAZ3DlVq"
38,"@Helloimmorgan it’s their specials collection for the auction only. 

&amp;&amp; honestly it would be prudent of OS to start working with projects that are hyped as such to ensure they are verified prior to launch. 

..the scams that immediately follow a launch are disgusting."
39,great breakdown for soethbys auction of 104 punks today. eager for the result..big day for the space. 👀 https://t.co/qw9uqMpyUN
40,@floornfts would love….notifications for x-percentage movement of the floor on a particular project. I am in 50+ collections. can only pay attention to 5-10. I wish I knew if one of the other 45 collections moves by 20+% in a given day so I can trade on that movement. 🙏
