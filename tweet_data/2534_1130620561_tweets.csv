20,"$magic targets weren't hit so have been rotating my stables to $gala and $osmo. Hoping gala convincingly breaks out of this downtrend, best case scenario for me is it approaches highs and magic continues to range lower this month. https://t.co/WY9pSWSHn8"
21,There's a lot of luck involved in finding gems in this space but you get the most value from these opportunities by doing what you can to help them shine.
22,"I honestly spent more time playing Town Star, working to be the best at it, writing about it, and assisting people in the discord interested in learning the game than I did making modules for my students and preparing for the online classes I was responsible for that schoolyear."
23,"That I was getting that much $gala from referrals is a reflection of the time, effort, and hustle I put in contributing to Gala's early growth by being an active community member &amp; creating content https://t.co/CdE8jOncRt"
24,The other day the persistent rewards for referrals running their own Gala nodes were stopped. I now receive 37.5% less gala/day and this is healthier for the ecosystem as a whole. It was decided through a governance vote by node owners last Nov and I proudly voted in favor of it.
25,"@bbleezy2k3 Instead of guessing a word you need to make a logical equation😂

61,Got to exit my entire position at $6.6 last night before I went to bed. $magic tapped $4 again because of the $1m buys before I could get more so I forced myself to sleep to resist fomo. Should be patient and try to buy closer to the unlock. Hoping for an entry at ~$2.7 for magic https://t.co/hnRepjlslT
62,"@dragonboyultra I think so too. I'm assuming it ranges lower when the rewards get halved but gains momentum again as they release more features and have significant increase of average users. Still a good long term play imo, actually considering keeping a small bag"
63,"@Vegeta_JC Personal short term target was 6 so happy with these gains haha! Possible retrace to 5 and not willing to risk missing my $magic entry. I think not bad to hold for a few months (before the strategic sale unlock) and might be 10 by then though, sulit rewards kung mag play out yun!"
