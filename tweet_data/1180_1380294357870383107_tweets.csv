13,@cagyjan1 Fully agree here. Defending it with comparable fee structures also is a very poor look.
14,@SmoochAxie Defending the increase with an argument of it being fair with other fees is a very poor look especially when the creator idea is flawed and not ready. Really illustrates different reasoning for the change.
15,Fee being in line with other comparable marketplaces is a rate hike and not a positive thing for community growth and creators. Feels very telling. https://t.co/KtWT8iQuvy
