13,It’s poetic that my first Grail piece 💎 is none other than the legend I grew up listening to in the Bay Area. Pac was one of the greatest poets of modern times. @PhtoNFT @PatJohnsonphoto https://t.co/HJaimVhjca
14,@Reaper_NFT @PhtoNFT @PatJohnsonphoto @2PAC @SantanaCarlos Thanks! Pretty mindblown myself haha! So stoked! 🙏💎🙌
15,In my excitement I mistakenly overlooked @chimodu’s epic collection…apologies good ser. Gotta give credit where credits due. There are 3 PAC’s in his collection so this one is not the 1st. But it dam sure is my favorite and it’s the only 1/1 I can find anywhere. 💎😍
16,So stoked on winning the Pac piece! Thank you! @PhtoNFT @PatJohnsonphoto 🔥🔥🔥💎 https://t.co/RmVtdDQfOo
17,"Did I just buy the first ever 2Pac NFT in the history of the blockchain?!! A true 1/1. Photo taken by @PatJohnsonphoto when Pac was 20 yrs old. Shout out to @PhtoNFT @SlamDiegoZoo for making it happen! Stoked! 🙏🙌🔥I will be 💎🙌 this one.
