63,@thingdoms Is there an emoji for “patience”?
64,@ChezBeignet @thingdoms Riddle me 🧩!!!
65,"@vasa_develop @LorensHuculak @gemxyz An idea would be to refund the pro-rata of gas fees. If estimated gas cost was $100 in gas to buy 10 NFTs, and only 5 executed, return $50 in gas fees back to the user, with perhaps less 1% to 3% to Gem for processing. Would drive additional positive adoption and good-will."
66,@Art101NFT Class act!
67,"@vasa_develop @LorensHuculak @gemxyz I understand that, but I was curious about the gas fee refund. For example, If I try to sweep 10 NFTs, and only 1 executes, do I lose out on the gas fees (which were estimated for 10 NFTs)?"

83,"@LorensHuculak I have a question about using gem. I tried to buy 7 NFTs, and only four were executed. I was refunded the cost of the NFTs that didn’t execute, but I lost on gas fees which were quoted for 7 NFTs. Is that the risk I take, that gas fees won’t be refunded pro-rata?"
