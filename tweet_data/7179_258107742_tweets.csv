85,My first collection is called “Frankie - The Collection” after my dog/best friend. This collection will have 15 photos with 5 copies each. The photos will be sold at .15 ETH and 50% of the sales will be donated to animals shelters local to those cities.
86,"That is why I’ve started my own NFT project dedicated to helping support animal shelters. In different cities across the country I will be capturing the moments that make me slow down and bring me peace, and I hope they bring you peace as well."
87,"When I dropped out the only thing I was sure of was that I absolutely loved helping animals and I was so intrigued by the art of photography. At the time I had no idea how to bring these two things together, but the NFT space has shown me that truly anything is possible."
88,"My name is Christina Trumbo, I’m 24 years old and was born and raised in Oklahoma. Since I’m from Oklahoma I would love to say that I have a degree from The Univ. of Oklahoma, but after about 3 years and 7 changed majors later I decided maybe that wasn’t the best route for me."
