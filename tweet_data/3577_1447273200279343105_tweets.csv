31,"If you haven't checked out generative art, some of my favorites are Fidenza by @tylerxhobbs, Filaments by @abwagmi, Wavelength by @KalebsCode and all of the @braindrops_art collections. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!"
32,"Generative art is AWESOME:

The points I made above were somewhat based on facts and logic, but this point is not. I think that generative art is so cool. 10 years ago I would have not imagined I could buy a piece of art created by an AI, but now I can, and this blows me away."
33,"Who I think will buy generative art:

As I said, the wealthy often buy art as a store of value. A large portion of wealthy people now, and especially in the future, will be people associated with tech. I could definitely see these people being interested in art created by an AI."
34,"Storing wealth:

It is common for the wealthy to store money in art. This is because when you buy a piece of art, as long as it does not get damaged, it usually goes up in value. The interesting thing about art in the form of NFTs is that they cannot be damaged."
35,"Generative art:

Generative art is art that was created by an AI. I think that this could be one of the next big trends in art because it is one of the first times people can appreciate something that was intended to be art but was not created by humans."
36,"Main Points:

- Generative art could be the next art trend
- Art is a great way to store wealth
- Who I think will be interested in generative art
- Generative art is SO COOL (imo)"
37,"In this thread I will go over why I think it is a good idea to invest in generative art NFTs.

I AM EXTREMELY BIASED SO TAKE THIS ALL WITH A GRAIN OF SALT"

48,The game that they have planned will allow mass adoption of the project and bring in capital from people that are not already holders. This will create great sustainability for the Nanoverse in the long run.
49,"Final Thoughts:

I am extremely bullish on this project because of its unique take on a metaverse. I was able to speak with the founders fairly early on, and their ability to answer all questions with ease instantly sold me."
50,"7 - The Nanoverse. The long term plan of this project is to make their own metaverse that will double as a dungeon crawler game. They plan on opening the game to everyone, but the NANOPASS holders will be granted extra resources through Black Boxes."
51,"5 - Partnerships with other NFT colletions. The team has already executed on this, as they are already partnered with notable names such as @KaijuKingz.
6 - Additional series of premium perpetual loot boxes."
52,"Roadmap:

1 - NANOPASS mint. 50% of all mint proceeds will be used to build in phase 2.
2 - NANOPASS reveal and the community vault comes online.
3 - Black Boxes begin. This will begin 1-2 weeks after public mint.
4 - Project SUBNET. We are still waiting for this to be revealed."
53,"Team:

The NANOPASS team consists of @reicannon, @REEEEEruiiiii, @Yuri_ramen, and @iamabsinthe.

The team is a group of friends that come from various backgrounds and were brought together by the serial entrepreneur @reicannon."
54,"For each NANOPASS that you own, you will be granted a weekly Black Box.

Black Boxes are funded by 7.5% of secondary sales. With over 1.7K volume before public sale, so you can expect these to have some nice surprises.

The community will be deciding what Black Boxes contain."
55,"NANOPASS will act as your plot of land and access pass in the Nanoverse.

4,500 NANOPASS were minted via a whitelist with a price of 0.088 ETH, and the remaining 1,000 will be minted tonight by dutch action with a starting price of 2.69 ETH."

62,"Final Thoughts:

With this experienced and quick working team, I could see Furballs being something comparable to @AxieInfinity.

I also think that the mobile game and scholarship program will create sustainability for Furballs by exposing it to people outside of their ecosystem."
63,"Roadmap:

Their roadmap has been coming to life quickly, and Voyages seem to be just around the corner! https://t.co/DQtkVrGADw"
64,"Team:

The Furballs team consists of notable names such as @inZania, @queenfurballs, @abwagmi, @_MouseDev, and many more.

This team has been working very hard and it shows. Since launch they have updated the UI/UX, made their  own L2 solutions, and launched merch."
65,"The rate at which a Furball generates $FUR is dependent on its level, boost, and the amount of Furballs that you own.

The level of a Furball is dependent on how long you have it in explore mode, and its boost is luck based and assigned when it is minted."
66,"Furballs is currently a staking game with plans to become a fully interactive mobile game.

The first 2,500 Furballs were a free mint, but there is a max supply of 7,500. All Furballs can generate $FUR while in battle, and the remaining 5,000 Furballs will be minted with $FUR."
