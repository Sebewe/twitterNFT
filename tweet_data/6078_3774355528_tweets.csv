16,"@CryptoDJ_CO @aleph0ne @JungleBayAC Almost like they are into trading NFT's on the side lol, what the hell is wrong with that?

20,"@AttorneySeal1 @aleph0ne @JungleBayAC I realize that’s a rough spot, and it should have been voted on, really.

In short, I think it’s more ideal to give them a special NFT &gt; a bunch of ETH and royalties."

28,"@AttorneySeal1 @aleph0ne @JungleBayAC TLDR - we all invested in OG LBAC (not the one on OS), got rug pulled, the rugger also stole the art so the art owner got us delisted without offering any help to merge the communities. We banded together to build our own project instead of taking a big L…."
29,"@AttorneySeal1 @aleph0ne @JungleBayAC Honestly I can’t recall off the top of my head if there was a full on vote, I don’t know If we had the DAO set up back then. I’ll inquire and get back when I here. Aleph and DLV came in the Discord and had a civil, productive chat which was very good."
30,"@AttorneySeal1 @aleph0ne @JungleBayAC They worked endless hours after we got rugged and delisted by LBAC. They were just community members like us, but they took on all of it for JBAC. You’d rather them taking our ETH and royalties non-stop, or getting a piece of memorabilia to hold for their efforts?"
31,"@AttorneySeal1 @aleph0ne @JungleBayAC Do you know our entire story though? That part is VERY important. Our community would rather them own an NFT instead of taking ETH and royalties. Now, all those funds are used for the community DAO, not taken by them."
32,"@aleph0ne @MooseVsHunger @JungleBayAC @cotuck If they instead took ETH then we’d have other people pissed off, you can’t please everyone. No one in our community was upset by letting them own a piece, people looking in from the outside shouldn’t, either, once they learn our entire story."
33,"@aleph0ne @MooseVsHunger @JungleBayAC @cotuck If you know our story, and still think these people don’t deserve a small piece of the journey, then there’s nothing to discuss, but calling it a “red flag” is disingenuous if you still disagree. This community is filled with honest, solid people…"

35,"@aleph0ne @JungleBayAC The royalties are put into the treasury for the DAO, before we discuss, do you know our entire story and how we got where we are?! Because that’s important to know."
36,"@aleph0ne @JungleBayAC Are you aware of how we started? A rug pull and delisting and a community left with nothing. These people worked for nothing to keep the community alive, THAT alone is worth the payment, you can disagree all you want, but you’re VIOLENTLY wrong in that thought 🤦‍♂️"

38,@de_cuire Beautiful family!
39,"@BisforBooty Agreed, and in this case it’s even more so less of a red flag when these people volunteered 3 months (and still going) of their time to build this for free and this was their payment. Thanks for agreeing, and you’re right, this space has a lot of that BS."
40,"@BisforBooty It’s not, and if he would’ve taken 1 minute to actually ask why, it would’ve made more sense. I can’t believe people are praising his “research” which concluded unwarranted FUD 🤦‍♂️"
41,@Mau5Marketing @aleph0ne @JungleBayAC Take a minute to read the comments. Aleph should’ve spent 1 minute researching why things are the way they are before putting out unwarranted FUD.

50,"@MooseVsHunger @aleph0ne @JungleBayAC @cotuck As were JungleBay's, aside from those ones for the team. We were rugged, delisted and this team worked for 3 months for free to build this project after what we went through, that was their only payment, I think that's completely fair. The other 1/1's were spread in the mint."
51,"@aleph0ne @JungleBayAC And aside from that, yes, we ARE very passionate about the project and would love for you to join us, there aren't red flags here fren, unless you disagree with that being a fair payment for 3 months of time spent working for free. It certainly doesn't bother me, though."
52,"@aleph0ne @JungleBayAC Repost - It's not though, this project was community built and the team that built it did it for FREE. Getting a 1/1 was their only payment for months of busting their asses to revive this community and build JungleBay. Seems like a fair payment to me, don't you agree?"
