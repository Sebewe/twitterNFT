31,@HenryChatfield @YouTube @glassprotocol @soundxyz_ @catalogworks @mintsongs @viamirror I also feel artists should use web3 to build and reward their collectors first to then invest some of the money that they have earned into distributing the art across all web2 platforms in order to build an audience for touring
32,"@HenryChatfield @YouTube @glassprotocol @soundxyz_ @catalogworks @mintsongs @viamirror Personally think it all starts inweb3 whether that's launching the video on glass intially, (premieres feel so much better in web3 imo)let it breathe for a week and then roll out across multiple  curated YouTube channels feeding back to the official video on artists own channel."

38,"@HenryChatfield Love this Henry, often something I think to myself when giving back is ""do they actually even want whatever it is im giving?"" super interested to see how this plays out and what the response to offering participation looks like."
39,"@MartinOceanHQ @sophiaalexa @soundxyz_ Just listened, this goes CRAZY @sophiaalexa"
40,"Cool thing about #web3 is it completely takes the artists focus off of vanity metrics like streams or followers and puts the focus on one to one fans, charts are meant to reflect sales and earnings for an artist which in today's current system is not the case due to the red tape"
41,@wronskidoteth @SLOEJACKY @soundxyz_ Congrats!

52,@exhale_jr I really like ur face too though js
53,@HennessyVibes Sad reacts only 🥲🥲🥲
54,Is there anyone who's actually cool/ interesting that is on the anti nft train? It always seems to be a very specific type of person that hates on them... Usually people who hate learning or feel threatened by change. Probably why the communities around nfts are so positive haha
55,"I'm sitting on a song that I deeply deeply love, I don't put too much weight on my music but I really love this one, it comes out in April and I'm manifesting having it launch on @soundxyz_"
56,Web 2 me vs web3 me 😈 https://t.co/L2fwajfnOd
57,"No one reads your magazine so you're creating a false sense of importance in the first place, and you expect artists to spend 2k on a press person to get put in your magazine that gets no clicks unless an artist posts it 🤣🤣🤣"
58,"Most publications villianizing the likes of Spotify or other DSPS are the same publications that do nothing but steal from artists and use them to sell copies of a magazine, you stand for nothing. Also PR is the biggest robbery of artists can we talk about that???"
