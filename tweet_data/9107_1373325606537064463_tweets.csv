2,"@cryptoknitties Watched that vid recently myself. I knew at the time playing the game how far ahead it was but then after watching the breakdown, fascinating!"
3,"@bitfalls @MetaMaskSupport The best written one I’ve seen, for many newcomers unfortunately would be convincing. Even the use of the helpful link at the bottom no doubt pointing elsewhere but still reinforces a false security. Read receipt, friendly follow up email from a CS rep. 🙃"

5,ETH is like the paper credits you win at the fun fair. Then marketplaces like OpenSea are where you have to spend it all before the fun day finishes.
6,"@UNQNFTbot 👋 Daily would be great. Even alerts on low trait (rare) purchases or rare attribute sales like blondes and multi buys (sweeps) maybe asking a lot. Also you need to break the magic follower number, no-one wants to be 70 😂 https://t.co/oCNFCP2FL4"

24,Wonder how many IRL phishing attempts are made at these crypto conferences. Like a sushi bar for bad actors.
25,@ryancarson The castle I would buy with it.
26,"@macomoroni Another handy one, If interacting with different hardware devices via MetaMask, each time you switch between hardware wallet change VPN server on the comp using MM. As MM pulls wallet, NFT data via API so bad actors can associate your wallets if on the same IP."

33,Another project to keep an eye on I believe is Battle for Nova https://t.co/xVKENX98vz @DonnieBigBags doesn’t waste time neither does the team behind it. Wish them all the best. Keeping my 👀 on this!

38,"Highly recommend listening to this podcast on Wallet security. Even if you think you may know a lot there’s always something you may not know. If you only use MetaMask, this episode will scare you enough into getting a hardware wallet, in a good way. 👍 https://t.co/C6hhrnU030"

48,@gfk_acid @sergitosergito Interesting to think about. 🙂
49,"@xrp_bridge @0xPolygon Maybe check RPC settings in MetaMask, check you’re on the correct network, chain ID is up to date? RPC error on the bottom perhaps help. 🤷‍♂️"
50,"@PinballerComic @TheSandboxGame Nice! I have 9 plots as well, I think yours looks like 9? I made some stuff in their Vix editor last year but had to use Parallels for windows. Is it still Win only? My plots are all split up though :("
51,"@SubstraPunk @econoar Thanks for sharing, keep an eye on things better!"
52,@gfk_acid @sergitosergito Bit out there scenario I know. Just a thought I had when watching the movie Greenland 😆 guess if it were that bad there would be higher priorities. Always been fascinated by https://t.co/Ao9EcQkXn3 see the true power of the internet.
53,"@gfk_acid @sergitosergito Yeah agreed. I couldn’t really fit it all into a tweet. Was more of a scenario, solar flare ongoing for days, affecting globally. Are there full nodes placed in underground areas? Like Proton mail with their servers underground. “Trusted nodes” to help maintain the chain."
54,"@Hackatao @elonmusk @westcoastbill I’ve experienced similar. Learnt to just go for it and know at least I tried, always end up learning something either outcome. Enjoyed the Kevin rose podcast btw 👍"

63,@VGFreakXBL Upset you weren’t added to the cool list?
64,@sergitosergito I asked Lex Fridman if he could ask Vitalik last time he was on his postcast via tweet. Similar question. More relating to a solar flare though. Does anyone keep a storage of the chain on a daily basis? Like Microsoft storing physical film of GitHub repos “Arctic Code Vault”.

How many Metaheros does it take to work a monitor? 😂 We will find out today."
82,"@MoskowMamma @ASUSUSA May come of as patronising but simplest of things sometimes.. Have you tried a different device such as another comp, games console. If the same, maybe see if 2x hdmi port at the back and it’s defaulting to one of those? Are you using comp &gt; dongle &gt; hdmi?"
