and that's it so far, thanks for reading. i'm excited to keep creating and sharing my journey with you all. 

I hope this thread can inspire more artists to join this space and find creative freedom.

if you want, you can check out my genesis here: https://t.co/mAO3jzZoxK

what i find really awesome is, out of the 14 people who bought one of my nfts, only 2 were people i know irl. the other 12 I met on discord and twitter just from being in the mix. one of my favorite things about this space is that people genuinely like to support artists."
13,"8/
while it isn't all about the money for me, it's a nice feeling to finally be rewarded for your creativity and see that it's possible to make a living off your art. esp after years of companies pricing your song at $1 and paying crumbs for thousands of people listening to it."
14,"7/
this showed me a smaller group of supporters in web3 can be more powerful than a large traditional fanbase. the equivalent of almost half a million streams came from just 14 people...wtf"
15,"6/
to put this into perspective, to make $1800 from streaming, you would need ~450,000 streams on sp*tify. if the 14 people who collected my genesis wanted to support me in the same way they did when they bought my nft, they’d each need to stream my song 32,000 times…"
16,"5/
fast forward, i dropped my genesis nft project on jan 19th, 2022. 26 nfts, each one featuring my new song ""Make Sure"" and a unique artwork, priced at 0.05ETH ~$130 

out of 26, so far i've sold 14 for a total of 0.7ETH. after OS fees i saw 0.68ETH which is around ~$1800 rn"
17,"4/
in the months that followed, i spent all my free time researching and learning everything i possibly could.

I minted and bought a bunch of nfts, ventured into defi, got rugged, got rekt, fumbled some bags but learned 
a lot (21 voice) and also made some awesome new frens."
18,"3/
after feeling stuck for awhile, I discovered nfts and i took the deep dive this past summer. immediately it felt like everything i had been looking for. a place that offers creative freedom and the ability to value my art as i see fit."
19,"2/
bg: i’ve been an artist my whole life, i like to make music, design, shoot photos, and make clothes. my ultimate goal has always been to create full time.

after working 9-5 while pursing a career in music for a long time, i realized it wasn't working and i needed to pivot."
