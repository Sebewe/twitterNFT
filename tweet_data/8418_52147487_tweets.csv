95,@Zac_Aztec @cryptoMaxi420 @SoSoCrypto2 @PolygonHermez Yes! Exactly! We don’t care about the stark proof size becouse it will be a private input of the groth16 circuit!
96,@Zac_Aztec @cryptoMaxi420 @SoSoCrypto2 @PolygonHermez We are not sure yet. But the idea is to compensate with more queries..
97,@Zac_Aztec @cryptoMaxi420 @SoSoCrypto2 @PolygonHermez We will try to work with 2x domain extension (adding extra polynomials if required). And the last levels of the merkle tree we can use sha256 to improve proving time (at the cost of extra constraints in the stark verifier).
98,"@Zac_Aztec @cryptoMaxi420 @SoSoCrypto2 @PolygonHermez We are studying GPU’s. Besides that, the idea is to send each polynomial to different machines.  We have been thinking also to build a supercomuper with butterfly network connection schema. But we will try the other approaches first."
99,@Zac_Aztec @cryptoMaxi420 @SoSoCrypto2 @PolygonHermez fft’s and poseidon hash is computing intensive work. We are working to optimize it as much as we can because this will limit the gas we will be able to process. The cool thing is that in starks we don’t need to do exponentiations. And we can always parallelize those computations.
