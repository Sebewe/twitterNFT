85,@Cryptone0116 @pokeposer @HumansMetaverse @LittlelemonsNFT @FomoMofoNFT Exactly 😂
86,@Cryptone0116 @pokeposer @HumansMetaverse @LittlelemonsNFT @FomoMofoNFT But a scenario like this is what brought about the idea of a WL in the first place. So I believe that as the NFT space and community as a whole evolves the process of minting and WL will transform completely from what the process is today
87,@Cryptone0116 @pokeposer @HumansMetaverse @LittlelemonsNFT @FomoMofoNFT I agree! I think that this is part of the solution.Maybe in the future WL can be comprised of mostly holders of other projects!Which would be ideal in some ways but it also would make it incredibly hard to enter the space. So it would also require a goodway for new people to join
