32,"I called him Tiger, because he looks like a little tiger. Tiger is smarter than me, he won't buy NFTs that look like himself because he knows these are deceptive, and he won't mint other NFTs with a wallet with millions of dollars in assets.😼
Long live Tiger! https://t.co/fNmzV5dTGx"
33,"Whenever a market goes into a lull, people always throw away valuable chips in a rush to money, if there’re enough players.

So there’s a simple strategy for #NFT :pick a valuable collection, wait for the lull and pick up valuable bargains that others throw out.

Time is money.🙏🏻"
