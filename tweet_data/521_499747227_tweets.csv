22,@OGDfarmer @LooksRareNFT @gridplus @Trezor Yeah I guess my trezors will go the way of the Dodo. Dammit ... I liked them.
23,@ape7458 A little bit pissed.
24,@DanielitoG25 I'm happy for both. Those who made a great flip .. and those who can afford to pay 7 figures for an nft. I made a (for me) epic flip... but I couldn't enter into a lot of stuff I entered if I just stumbled over nfts yesterday.
25,@J0N45__ 🤣🤣🤣🤣 dammit ... yeah guilty ... got one of those. Never use it. I think VR still has a long way to go ... too gimmicky. Half Life Alyx was decent though.

41,@digitaldamaged noice!
42,@tmagled @BoredApeYC @yugalabs @DrifterShoots I'd called it: Stable market. But the @DrifterShoots Idea is better lol
43,@Legend @diverse yeah... sus
44,@tmagled @BoredApeYC @yugalabs needs a free-fall tower that shoots you repeatedly to the middle part of the atmosphere and then violently rips you back down (happens 5 times before you're allowed to exit)
45,@adamsmoot @jenkinsthevalet yeh... for me lore is important. Them pfps need a reason to be alive.

54,@NathanHeadPhoto Windows. Mac is too restrictive for my personal preference.
55,@tmagled @doodles Sorry but I'd argue that it would be legitimate to buy. DYOR is important in this space everyone should be able to read 2 lines of text.
