1,@Rxdha1 I’m sure 😂
2,They believe that this can be done by anyone. This is a very irresponsible attitude that can have great consequences.
3,The incompetence of these companies and believing that a NFT is something that can be offered to a brand without further ado could affect brands that are already well established and all to save money.
4,I know for a fact that a lot of advertising and communication agencies in Madrid are giving some employees the responsibility and the tittle of “NFT and Metaverse specialist” without them knowing anything about it.

I just got paid from @BoredPunksNFT, a brand new rug NFT Project. Their discord is already at 100,000 bot members with no sign of anything

1. Raise $70m for your NFT project
2. Pretend you’ll pay $7m to fix it
3. Wait a few days/weeks
4. Never tweet’s again"
28,"Wen raising $70mil and then playing a victim’s role for delivering a low and shitty quality project has become a thing? Making a refund is the only way but I bet this “founder” will disappear with the $ in a few days/weeks 

I hate what people like this does to this space… https://t.co/bOOxZRpyDV"
29,@Syberer I bet you and this project will disappear in a few weeks with the $. If you want to do the right thing you should make a refund to everyone and start form 0 (I didn’t bought your shit) but this is unbelievable
30,@Syberer “Let’s raise $70mil and send the people who believed in us a real shitt and bad low quality “art” then we will play a victim’s role and say we are going to do the right thing…” this is a fcking JOKE people like you that take advantage of this space are the worst.
31,@cobie I’m sure that will never happen. This kind of projects needs to end and the creators should be held accountable for this.
