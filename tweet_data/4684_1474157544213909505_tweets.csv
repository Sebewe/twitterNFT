6,@FangGangNFT @LittlelemonsNFT @Cryptoon_Goonz @FudderVerse @bricktopians Bricktopians - most original project out there. The time and money this team has put into the art is unmatched. With this community its bricks or nothing. A lot of big things coming soon and new projects by amazing artist law degree. This project has huge potential.
7,"@FangGangNFT @LittlelemonsNFT @Cryptoon_Goonz @FudderVerse @bricktopians Fudders - this project is extremely slept on. Some of the best pfps available and literally everyone could find their forever fudder. The potential is endless. Probably the funnest community there is, they could be under 0.1 forever but they’re not going anywhere."
8,"@FangGangNFT @LittlelemonsNFT @Cryptoon_Goonz @FudderVerse @bricktopians Cryptoon Goonz - I think this project has the coolest art in the space and the community agrees. The founder works super hard and him and his small team are very dedicated. There’s a lot of big things coming in the future for the goonz, I don’t know how they’re still under 1eth."
9,@FangGangNFT @LittlelemonsNFT @Cryptoon_Goonz @FudderVerse @bricktopians Little lemons - this is the most die hard community in the space. The holders absolutely love their lemons. A lot of the holders also hold other big projects but they rep their lemons to the death. Possibly the best community in the game so they really can’t lose.
10,@FangGangNFT @LittlelemonsNFT @Cryptoon_Goonz @FudderVerse @bricktopians Fang gang - this project has been around since early September. Its stood the test of time and the team keeps delivering as they just launched new fang city today. Amazing community and cool art at a really affordable price rn.
