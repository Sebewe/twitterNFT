11,@0xHustler That’s dope! Much love to the 3rd winner!
12,@0xHustler Hahahaha 😂 I hate people who clamor for attention when they want something
13,"@GamblingGnomes Im not sure, Fortune Friends club tends to do a lot of giveaways and collabs idk their requirements though :)"
14,@GamblingGnomes I would but I don't handle collabs so I can't help you with setting one up.
15,@GamblingGnomes yep! You probably won't get a response but it gets read and documented as a possibility :)
16,"@GamblingGnomes I don't handle collabs! Feel free to dm the twitter, however our schedule is full at the moment, if it changes we will keep you guys in mind :)"

20,@JensenTung Thank you for bringing me on &lt;3
21,"and you keep the funds to continue and eventually you and I will get there. 

- If there's anything you wanna know that I didn't touch on shoot me a DM / comment &lt;3 
- I shoulda just done a Twitlonger this was WAYYYY more than I expected hahaha"
22,"There's gonna be people who shame me, hate on me and any who list for floor / below pre reveal. My only advice is have conviction for your choice, get a good reason, and ignore them. Don't worry if it turns out rare, if floor moons you did what was right on the knowledge you had"
23,I instantly paid back EVERYONE who gave me the eth and continue to look into flipping the eth I have. With such a small amount It's necessary to flip early and take small profit I don't have a safety net of ETH incase a long term hold goes to 0
24,"but It was a start with my very small eth left over ~.19 I had 2 other people be generous and give me money to try and cover any gas fees, I got MegaPal for wonderpals and minted 2! I then sold one for 1eth an insane flip for most people and especially right off the bat."
25,"I'd run the server, I got lot's of inspiration from the Cool Cats discord and the people I met, I then get Whitelist for a project and someone offers me some funds, the next day the SAME thing offers me WL and the funds to mint (Both under minting price now rip)"
26,"We set up a meeting so I could meet @0xVinasaur and @velvetmooncake the Dev and Artist on the team.... And I missed the meeting. Completely got busy and forgot go first job right? Luckily they were super forgiving. I started thinking immediately, giving ideas, and wondering how"
27,"a project he was working on, I didn't know any details but we introduced ourselves and went on our way, flash forward to late Nov/early Dec I reached back out just to have an update on where we were for the project and we talked a bit and got into the discord early December"
28,"Back in October I put a looking for work in the cool cats discord for a CM position unpaid, I'm a teenager and have no experience. I said I didn't want to be paid because the learning and experience would be enough @JensenTung reached out within 24 hours letting me know about"
29,"Threw a curveball my way, ALL pet nominees were on the WL I immediately messaged her (Uncle Frex) on discord and asked if I could submit someone else's wallet and that's the end of that story. Now onto my journey of earning ETH."
30,"I didn't have ETH and didn't have a way to get eth. I don't like handouts or asking for money (Especially that much) so I asked for my nomination to be given to someone else, he kindly said it was probably gonna be a raffle so I told myself I just wouldn't enter then @lilfrecklez"
31,".@Grampa_Bacon and @ItsTymo when I first got nominated by Adam I was super stoked it felt good to be recognized especially as a kid in a space full of tech wizards, finance magicians, and all the above. I looked at that nomination and was super happy there was just one issue..."
32,"as I 17 year old with no bank account all the NFT's (Airdrops) I had, I had earned, not out of pocket etc. Even if I lost EVERYTHING I would be content that I hadn't gone negative and lost money . Fast forward to cool pets, as many of you know I was nominated by..."
33,"S/O to Ali (Liam) for putting up with me wondering how to turn weth into eth without needing to have gas funds so I could mint @VinnieHager's letters i got WL for (Sadly I missed mint), I went into this space knowing i'd lose money there was a glimmer of hope though"
34,"I met so many amazing people one of the first being @officialalim, I hung out in the cool cats discord so often and continued to see the positivity and enjoy being there. I continued to learn and ask questions about this space and asked for a LOT of direction and advice"
35,"I first found out about NFT's because @frak5555 asked @Yasin_Wunsung for help on @coolcatsnft very first puzzle. Me and Yasin (Sensei) made puzzles together online from other discords so he made a GC and brought me in, from there we solved the puzzle ""Cats Hodl/hold for life....."
36,Here's my journey 1/x? (hopefully short)

39,@TakeoffTone It’s definitely interesting the main complaint I’ve been seeing is “we can’t check updates so they shouldn’t have done it cause I sold for a loss”
40,@TakeoffTone Having a new collection or just an “in game” has been done before this gives some personal feeling of ownership. That’s not just a spaceship in game it’s “my” space ship I think they wanted to do something new and they did it. Let’s see what they use it for now who knows what.
41,"@TakeoffTone Don’t even own a doodle but I think it’s smart as hell, wrap your doodle as a new piece without hurting supply to be used in future games and and what seems to be a skill training simulator type. The UX/UI looked insane and I’m excited to see the future for them"
42,@thekingpinner @cr0ssETH @doodles Cause they’re dumb.
43,@thekingpinner @cr0ssETH @doodles If you’re investing this much money and refusing to keep up with what you invested in you can’t complain when your ignorance hurts you 😂
44,@thekingpinner @cr0ssETH @doodles “I don’t pay attention to updates they shouldn’t have done this because I didn’t read or follow up for months or read the article they sent out about the mechanic and all the warnings” is what you and everyone else are saying it’s dumb 😂 take ownership of it

99,@DoSomethingGuud @CudiEth @bobbyhundreds @DentedFeelsNFT @WeatheReportNFT Of course and I’m not saying you’re wrong to do so was merely giving another side :)
