3,"Here’s an idea: why doesn’t @Syberer pay @PAPERDIAMOND $1mil of that $70mil to redo the entire Pixelmon collection for a re-reveal? 

I’m not even joking 🙃 https://t.co/cYnDXQJrxg"
4,"@Metahero007 I get it, but I’d personally rather take that risk with other collections where I think the team deserves secondary sales royalties."
5,"@kivos_12 Meme ownership at this point I suppose is another reason. 

Just hate seeing more money flow from secondaries to that joke of a team."
6,@BoomBoomNFT @InvsbleFriends @Imaginary_Ones Can't wait for lawsuits to start hitting.
7,"What's the logic for buying at this point? Short-term flip?

Or maybe it's ""They raised lots of $, so they could still build a legit game"" ? Building a AAA game is hard af. If they botched reveal this badly, what makes you think they'll pull it together under this leadership?"
8,"In addition to the $70million @Pixelmon raised from initial sale, $33.5mil have been transferred in secondary markets in OpenSea. That's an additional $1.5million (4.5% royalties) to Pixelmon team.

15 of them sold in last hour, including 3 ""rares"" between 2-4ETH"
9,"@S33DS4U @Ay_Zimmy Not gone, just renamed his account to @jeffreywinnft. He probably does these giveaways, gets a bunch of followers, then changes username and pfp after. Cheating his way into a lot of followers to try and become an influencer or some bs."
10,"Yesterday I was going to try to be funny with a tweet along the lines of ""I might not have an @InvsbleFriends but I do have an imaginary friend that's worth a lot to me""

Then saw @Imaginary_Ones just now 😭 How tf do they have 300k followers?"
11,RT @iamVCLV: Some of you may have seen me posting a variety of 3D imagery over the last few months and I am excited to post what I consider…
12,Pixelmon is our fyre festival
13,What’s more vulnerable in the NFT world than showing someone what you’ve moved to your hidden tab?
14,"Also, even if they couldn’t figure out how to make an interactive 3D NFT viewer work in OpenSea (which is entirely possible like we see above), then pick another option to display them. Maybe like Apostles for @BYOPills where it’s a gif of the 3D model: https://t.co/C9Bo6sfaBR"

Honestly feel bad for whoever paid for this shambles of a project. And hey, hopefully they actually use the money to rescue it. That would be a great comeback story… but come on “OpenSea limitations” for 3D when we’ve seen a multitude of successful 3D projects 😂 https://t.co/dhiRqdc2Iw"

21,@doublesNFT @3Landers 👊🏽 loved the thread
22,"@BrandKnockout @omgkirbyDAO I know right? I picked one up thinking I might legit use this track for one of my future projects, or offer it to other projects."
23,"@gunh1gher ☺️

Honestly it’s worth it for people like you who share your thoughts and help challenge my thinking. We’re all still learning in this crazy innovative space!"
24,@gunh1gher https://t.co/cvnk8OrXV9
25,"@gunh1gher Fair, but I’d rather see:
* Tokens instead of NFTs (all the NFTs are the same and effectively passes, they don’t need to look like anything)
* Tokens should represent real ownership of company, like stocks.
* More reasonable entry price asks (if no ownership)"
26,"Seeing a trend of NFT projects where the utility is giving you early access to their new app. So basically pay hundreds of dollars for the privilege of beta testing. 

It’s a glorified Kickstarter. How many times in your life have you paid hundreds of dollars for an app?"
27,@richerd That’s why we need WLs and long mint windows. Otherwise you have not only gas wars but also life schedule ruining 😅
28,@the_freightrain @_portals_ @BYOPills @councilofkingz That said @YoelAryeh has had me craving a @CryptoCitiesNFT
29,@the_freightrain @_portals_ and @BYOPills myself. And everything @councilofkingz holds indirectly 😄
30,"In summary, why I'm bullish on @omgkirbyDAO:

1️⃣ Major vibes from these lofi beats and art
2️⃣ Music NFTs are just starting to heat up
3️⃣ DAO execution looks impressive
4️⃣ Love the mission &amp; vision

Go listen and find some faves: https://t.co/f2IxUSzrrh"
31,"Ultimately the mission of the DAO is to be a leading web3 music project, setting standards for decentralized music ownership, and be part of disrupting the music industry by providing new pathways for creators, musicians, and artists to succeed."
32,"Some example initiatives being voted on now:
* omgkirby creates a track with high-visibility artist feature
* Create a grant system to help empower up-and-coming musicians.
* Host an industry-focused roundtable discussion

https://t.co/jAoUpnhiPR"
33,"omgkirby is also formed as a DAO, with a community treasury. I was instantly impressed with the activity &amp; structure of the DAO.

They have 2 month long sessions. Each session has multiple initiatives, each run by a committee. DAO votes on initiatives."
34,"In a trendsetting move for music NFTs, owning a omgkirby NFT gives you complete ownership of the song in its entirety, which includes:

* Master Recording
* Publishing rights
* Access to lossless 24-Bit stem masters (the individual pieces that make up the song)"
35,This genesis collection of 3k NFTs combines hand-drawn art with a unique lofi track that is a collab between human and algorithms. https://t.co/4dWxd4dsAs
36,"The omgkirby group has serious music talent. Formed 2 years ago, their account has over 1 million monthly listeners on Spotify, with some of the chillest lofi beats I've heard. 

https://t.co/RpdHN0sh0E"
37,"Latest pickup: @omgkirbyDAO. Instantly became my favorite NFT music collection. 

Read this quick thread if you want to learn more about this dope project.

38,@the_freightrain Unless you converted to USD than you made 0.8 ETH which long term is a lot better than $300 IMO 😜
39,"@emilecrypto @BoredApeYC Apparently I didn't follow you as an ape, but I'll follow you now as a former-ape. Always part of the fam."
40,"@Metahero007 @beijingdou @councilofkingz @Just_in_Gains True, and we can thank them for bringing some mainstream attention, even if they are bastardizing the core concept 😆"
41,"Kudos to @beijingdou, @councilofkingz, and @Just_in_Gains for sparking these thoughts after a great Space on the metaverse earlier today: https://t.co/NVnzxhksbu."
42,"We know what the alternative is, and we know it's better. It may or may not be Sandbox, or Decentraland, or NFTWorlds, or a combo of others that gain success. But ownership and interoperability, stored on the blockchain, will be what we all define as the metaverse in 5 years."
43,"Does this mean Meta's ""metaverse"" will fail? No. I just think time will show it won't be a real metaverse. 

Games like Fortnite already challenge the notion of traditional games, and show the appetite for broader interactive experiences like it, but also isn't a metaverse."
44,"With these new web3 metaverses, you get to OWN and EARN in exchange for your time and commitment. That is the key. 

Meta and other ""traditional"" gaming entrants will focus on UX, believing they can build great games and VR experiences, but we know they'll be selfish in profits."
45,"Does this ultimately become a big-corporation, closed wall argument vs. open-source, decentralized argument? e.g. Windows vs Linux, etc. I think it's easy to dismiss it as such.

Here's the thing though: one metaverse model is clearly better than the other."
46,"In metaverses like @TheSandboxGame, @decentraland, and others, the time you put into the experience actually gives you something out of it. You can truly own land and what you build on the land. You can earn real rewards (currency tokens or NFTs, not just achievements/badges)."
47,"IOW:

A true web3 metaverse is like owning property in real life, and owning the items you you use everyday in your life.

A web2 world is more like like a vacation to an all inclusive resort. It's fun, but it's temporary and all you do is spend money/time."
48,"As @cdixon put it, imagine if IRL you went to a hotel, but had to come naked and only wear the clothes in the hotel closet. And when you left the hotel, you had to walk out naked. 

That is gaming &amp; web2 today. Closed walls, where the owner of everything is the platform creator."
49,"Ownership and interoperability are what blockchains and NFTs provide. 

That means:
* Owning and building your own land. 
* Owning or bringing in your NFTs to be your 3D avatar, accessories, event passes, or more across metaverses."
50,"A metaverse is not a real metaverse if it does not exist on a blockchain. If Meta is building their metaverse on their private servers, that is not a metaverse. It's just a game and/or VR experience.

Why? 👇"

54,@BoomBoomNFT https://t.co/Y8YOWf1R0G
55,"Personally for me: although life changing money would obviously be great, as someone who works in “traditional” tech I am so inspired by web3 that I’d like to set up a new direction in my career expertise wise.

Even if I could retire tomorrow, I’d be build NFT projects for fun."
56,What are your personal goals with NFTs?
57,"@jhancik 💯 

@psychedelic_nft once a month update as a blog post is an absolutely amazing approach for others to emulate for this. Kudos to @BAYC2745, they’re innovating and bringing professionalism in multiple ways."
58,"How do we know we’re still early? 

Because rn we’re saying “Never mint from non-official links. Unless the discord gets hacked. In which case don’t mint from those links either.” You need a PhD in Discord scamming to play right now."
59,"How to respect holders?
* Months long claim windows, or even better, free airdrops
* Provide updates in multiple formats (sporadic summary updates in discord, recorded AMAs/spaces, blog/website summaries, wikis/docs for complex projects)"
60,"I love NFT projects, but it's becoming standard expectation that owners must constantly check Discord/Twitter for updates.
e.g. short claim/mint windows, abuse of discord #announcements posts, etc

Fostering engagement != punishing for being away a few days

Respect your holders."
