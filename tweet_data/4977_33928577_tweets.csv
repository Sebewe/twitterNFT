1,@metamaximalist 🔥
2,@chilldonor @JungleFreaksNFT Welcome to the jungle!
3,"3/3 @morganstanley just said this emerging #metaverse market will be worth $8 TRILLION in #China alone. With #web3 we can own a piece of this directly, we can own the #metaverse itself. Don’t say you weren’t warned when these projects are household names by the end of the year https://t.co/VDLzORH0lG"
4,"2/3 using #NFT ‘s as high quality fully rendered characters that we can actually inhibit in a world like $NETVRK via PC, mobile app and even fully immersive #VR ( @Apple ‘s VR headset rumoured for this year) - this is going to be the next wave of value and utility. #NFTCommunity https://t.co/nC5ws5lEwc"
5,"1/3 @JungleFreaksNFT just dropped the mic with 3D avatars coming to OG holders using $JUNGLE utility token. Combined with the recent  @NetVRk1 partnership, the sheer scale, scope and quality of the #Metaverse they are building all in @UnrealEngine - it’s kind of game changing… https://t.co/11t0c2UWmK"
6,@Randall80072947 @angryapearmy @NetVRk1 Yup
7,"@nick_kuzmick @KatDevelopment Not a shill, but yeah @NetVRk1 will be the next Decentraland - but way way better $netvrk"
8,Looks rare 🔥👀 this will match my IRL #cybertruck which is on order. Can’t wait for this new drop from @JungleFreaksNFT @elonmusk @Tesla @THEPRINCE______ #NFT #NFTCommunity https://t.co/xOz0D7cr8I
9,@doodleguy83 @NetVRk1 Present 🙋🏽‍♂️
10,"But which #Metaverse?! It’s the question on everyone’s mind… Having deep dived them all, without a doubt @NetVRk1 looks like it will be by far the best, like the #OASIS from @readyplayerone. @SomniumSpace gets a special mention. $netvrk $cube $sand $mana #netvrk #cube #Bitcoin https://t.co/gczmM2hl6X"
11,@SomniumSpace @chandalak_vr Yo!? Where is my parcel shoutout it’s equally as cool! Parcel 529 check it out
12,@TheDogePoundNFT You can see my DOGE in my NEW VERIFIED TWITTER PFP :) SO EPIC!
13,"I own 12 @JungleFreaksNFT , the project is insane. Hard not to be crazy bullish on the future… it’s so early in terms of how far and wide this brand and vision can reach. Freaks will take the #metaverse by storm.  @THEPRINCE______ @hellowillfan @ed3___ #NFTs #DAO #JUNGLEFREAKS https://t.co/xdYZC4Ra1J"
14,@numbauponly 🔥
15,"@rollbitcom @TheDogePoundNFT will be next @BoredApeYC , look into it 👀"
16,"@joshnomics @trader1sz He doesn’t shill stuff, but $basis is what he is behind and it’s about to go ballistic, don’t get left behind - DYOR and you will see how mega it will be ;)"

19,@DeepFuckingDefi 👀👀 I love the smell of revolution in the morning
20,@Loopifyyy @Xdotxyz solves this
21,@The_OpenDAO The @Xdotxyz partnership is most exciting. When is the airdrop??
22,"Did this guy just trip over the cable to #Kazakhstan ‘s #internet connection? 18% of the worlds #Bitcoin miners are there… this is real reason it’s selling down. A similar thing happened when #china banned mining months ago, shortly after #BTC rallied hard 👀 #cryptocurrency https://t.co/39bzejmFJV"
23,@Xdotxyz @JohnLemonNFT @TheDogePoundNFT why are we not a part of this!?
24,@ellaorten Why? Hard at work building X marketing campaigns? :)
25,"@TheDogePoundNFT @niftygateway You SERIOUSLY need to get listen on @Xdotxyz ASAP - and get on their listing incentive program - trust me Doges, $X will flip Opensea itself as a better product but most importantly #web3 #Decentralised and community owned! Look into it @JohnLemonNFT"
26,@Xdotxyz Get the Doge’s onboard!! @TheDogePoundNFT
27,"@numbauponly @AOmetaverse @decentraland @Sveniac Wow, and from the Australis open, so unexpected"
28,@JRNYcrypto @gainzfeldt JRNY you obviously have not seen https://t.co/Y0WOdYKhSe yet!? X exchange is the one - partnered with @The_OpenDAO #sos and truely community owned… check it out. PS right now if you trade @BoredApeYC ‘s there you make the fees yourself not the exchange or anyone else
29,"@StrawberrySith @SomniumSpace 10pm Perth, Western Australia time work for you? @Sveniac I’m really keen to try this new thing too"

32,"My #2021withBinance … what a year!   Been with Binance for 1457 days, time flies… I traded $13 million USD on Binance this year… shouldn’t that come with a complimentary Lambo from all the fees I would have paid 😂 #Bitcoin #Ethereum #Binance  #DeFi https://t.co/Fzg0fRRxjO"
33,@pranksy https://t.co/7QgnnyBt9q
34,@kucoincom $SOS is the next $shib but way cooler as its a fair launch #DAO - good you are listing it! #SHIB #dogecoin
35,"I probably spent too much on JPEGS (and fees lol!) this year, but #nft’s are the future and it’s been a hell of a fun time so far. Amazing what @the_openDAO is doing, super bullish on the project, thanks for airdropping me 0.5eth for just trading NFT’s! #NFTCollector $sos #ETH https://t.co/rlCxQbqKIi"
36,@PerfectDAO @numbauponly @Sveniac @MegsieWood
37,"@PeterSchiff you sir, are a hack - one of the biggest public morons out there… instead of owning your mistake/s on #Bitcoin, you double down on your futile war against it with every passing month, meanwhile it consistently does the exact opposite of what you predict"
38,"@Meta_R00T @SomniumSpace This is really bloody good, well done! Welcome to the real metaverse!"
39,@fravincenti1 @SomniumSpace @teslasuit @katvrwalk @ASychov Is that a valve index?
40,@TraderSkew Meanwhile @basismarkets up 40% when everything else is red…. Probably nothing…
41,@ConcaveFi ‘s arrival will be …. Nothing short of a revolution in #DeFi …. Expect us https://t.co/TWXinzYbUW
42,"@ftx_us @SomniumSpace @FTX_Official I want to trade Somnium Space $CUBE in your exchange!! Please add it, hardly any exchanges have it yet… huge project, so far ahead of the pack"

44,@ObservantGun @SomniumSpace Agree
45,@BTCMarkets !! What the hell is going on with you guys? I did a standard USDT withdrawal yesterday and your transaction ran out of gas!? How do you not have gas on your end to process these? I opened support ticket nothing back! Please get back to me asap.
46,"“There are three ways to make a living in this business: be first; be smarter; or cheat. Now, I don't cheat. And although I like to think we have some pretty smart people in this building, it sure is a hell of a lot easier to just be first.” Sam Roger’s #Bitcoin #eth $cube $ncr"
47,@JacobCanfield To make way for ‘the new’ … its good
48,@ASychov @admixplay @SomniumSpace 👏🏾
49,"@QanonMac @SomniumSpace @LHebristean @Everdome_io @Metahero_io @wdw_io @Rob_Gryn $cube has been partnered with Sony since 2017 :) look into it. I’m not bashing Hero here, I’m a fan - but I am saying that as far as metaverses go I think $cube @SomniumSpace is hard to beat"
50,@cameron And $cube is THE metaverse that will matter the most! @SomniumSpace
51,@KMON447 Does NCR support NFT’s natively in world? Does it have land you can buy and build on?
52,@KirkDBorne #cube @SomniumSpace are best placed to be the Metaverse of choice… Amazing project
53,"@LHebristean @Everdome_io @Metahero_io @wdw_io @Rob_Gryn $cube and @SomniumSpace are already doing this, it’s built and fully VR ready… best kept secret in AR space"
54,@TheCryptoLark $CUBE … it’s 100% the next $SAND
55,@anarchyarcade @SomniumSpace V cool!
56,@TheMoonCarl $cube @SomniumSpace beats them both! VR at the core makes all the difference and @ASychov knows this - check it out
57,@elonmusk @ID_AA_Carmack Imagine if you two worked together…. It would be utter mind boggling insanity of the best kind
58,@cameron @LilMoonLambo 100%

63,"If you are wondering what the #Metaverse is and you haven’t seen #ReadyPlayerOne by Spielberg, go watch it - epic film but also a very insightful look at where this is all going (hopefully without the dystopian element!) #NFTs #Bitcoin #ETH #gm #WGMI https://t.co/5V103t04zM"
