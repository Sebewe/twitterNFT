1,@kosgoood @SkyMavisHQ I spoke to Greenranger about @0xSunflowerLand but you shouldn't underestimate what this game will do. It already broke matic and has the potential to create a real world burn mech for RON whilst also stress testing the network for future AAA titles.
2,Special thanks to @ZyoriTV for helping us to arrange the Axie Grant and for support getting this first season underway. We are super excited to welcome all the teams.
3,@DAVEvsAXIE won the testing season but who is going to take the Season 1 Championship NFT and AXS prizepool ??
4,"Registration will be opening for @AxieInfinity League on the 5th

5,@Allan_Ryan_ @AxieInfinity have you not heard the voices on twitter comments :D - sometimes it's best to remain centralized ... the community does not always know what is best.

7,"@PancakeSwap Promoting a burn that has zero price impact on an unlimited token :D 

I would MUCH rather see better tokenomics to reduce mint - that would be worthy of a post.

36,"@maximusalphax @danielesesta Also I agree with you, if someone invested too much that is on them. I didn’t leverage at all and sold at a massive loss. I take that L and will tax harvest it but to come back here acting green is BS. Just an addict looking for another dopamine hit from his fans IMO."
37,"@maximusalphax @danielesesta So lets look at the facts, he said they would cover those wiped out on leverage - they didn’t. He said they would keep focus on wonderland, they didn’t. He said they would not pull funds until people were made right, they didn’t. Facts show lies. Words are meaningless."
38,@danielesesta Why are you trying to be a victim here where there are so many that got screwed who will never get to recover? Your reputation to many is dead and you will never be able to make that right. It is what it is but don’t disrespect them further by playing your own victim card !!
