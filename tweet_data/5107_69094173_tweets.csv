4,"As more IRL brands embrace NFTs, I predict we'll see more utility tokens that build on this idea. 

If you've seen other innovative examples, drop a comment. I'd love to hear about them."
5,"Beyond that, the project offers the typical benefits you'd expect from a utility NFT: Generative art, merch drops, charitable donations, etc

That stuff is all great. 

But the truly novel idea here is an NFT that evolves based on outcomes from a real-world sporting event."
6,"2. #AusOpen Metaverse experience in @decentraland 

During the tournament, tennis fans can virtually attend the events in the #metaverse. They can explore re-creations of the stadiums and watch live streams of matches. 

NFT holders get VIP access. https://t.co/EGnOAOz74m"
7,"The mini-game is a genius marketing idea. It's the NFT equivalent of playing ""Super Bowl Squares"". 

People are more engaged watching sports when they stand to personally win something (even at long odds)"
8,"For Championship matches, the prizes are better. 

If the winning shot lands in your square, your NFT is effectively updated to a 1/1. 

Also, you win a real tennis ball used in the championship match 🎾 🏆"
9,"1. Match winning point mini-game 🎾 

Each NFT in the 6776 collection is assigned a unique plot on the tennis court. 

During the tournament, when a match winning shot bounces in your square, you win! 

Your NFT metadata and art will be updated on-chain, increasing the rarity. https://t.co/VZAJ0jIXmn"
10,"The #AusOpen NFT is crazy innovative. 

They've created a novel concept: an NFT that evolves and gains value based on real-time data from a sporting event.

Excited to see how the experiment unfolds.
