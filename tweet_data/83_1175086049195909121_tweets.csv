1,"In case anybody is interested i will make it my life mission to integrate $SPIT into everything i do in crypto. As a payment option, a lending collateral, for staking to earn other NFTs. I also don’t know the anon dev that created it, and the keys are burned. But it feels right. https://t.co/TKLQJ4h3aA"

12,"What NFT project can’t handle insults/jokes well? 

Like if you tweeted at a holder and you said “Your pfp makes you look like a tool” - who would overreact?"
13,@NGJKKS yes im referring to making money right now; not long term holds but sure you can find good entries here
14,"This is the market where if you want to make money you just can't use your brain

This is not a time you should be degening if you don't have liquidity OR don't understand how degening works.

People get stuck holding the bags.

(yes i degen too i understand the risks)"
15,good night to everyone for the people that it is night for https://t.co/6blnuKeVgY
16,"@Screwz1 I didn't want to go into an essay of how they distributed their WL - but yeah the point is they educated a majority of their buyers.

Sorry for the miswording - but at least in our server they gave spots for people that listened to the AMA that wanted it."
17,"@unveilance ??? do you see the market right now

Also 0.18-&gt; 1.45 eth sales in this market is really good.
I don't see anything minting out the next few days that can do almost a 10x off WL."
18,"@DmacNFT This is in a shit market.
It performed really well considering what is going on right now."
19,"The reason why our DA PUMPED even though we did it before whitelist?

We educated buyers.

Educate the people minting your project before giving them WL. Educate the people buying your project.

People sell because low confidence majority of the time or lack of value."
20,"People are asking me why Cartoons didn't moon and Antonym performed really well?

Whitelist distribution.

Majority of Antonym's WL was distributed for people that listened to an AMA.

Majority of Cartoon's WL was distributed to communities, discord spammers and upwork workers."
21,"You know what we do in this time frame of project founders feeling down because of this market?

We fucking build.
We did this in October and went from 0.08 to 1.9 ETH + the Llamaverse mint.

We got some crazy shit rolling this week.
Feeling determined as fuck."

24,@crazn_eth @Llamaverse_ It doesn't work according to them - we need budget for marketing and to increase investors...
25,"@lidi_son @Llamaverse_ No we need to list at 5 eth so we can run our marketing campaign and increase investors.

These people told me this works...."
26,"Alright guys - seen this in another server so i guess we can try it!

I need everyone to list your NFT at 5 ETH - so I can run marketing campaigns.

If you own a @Llamaverse_ go do this now! https://t.co/6TZkChZsrf"

36,"Guys this isn't about a specific project.
This is about the WHOLE SPACE.
Every project is a fucking rug.

Literally 80% of these projects are rugs.
I will only invest in founders and buy things after the devs have made money and they prove they are delivering.

I'm so sick of it."
37,"Unfortunately here is my new trading strategy...
Flipping WL every time

If they dip and the team seems confident that they can deliver, I'll buy the dip after reveal.

If the team seems hesitant and development slows down post mint. I made $.

I'm done with these rugs.
Fuck you."
38,"@wunksnft Very true - glad to see you all working.
Building some exciting stuff - it will get recognized eventually."
39,@AMNESIANFTS @OttoSuwenNFT None in specific.
40,"@OttoSuwenNFT Bro I don't even wanna talk about it
It's so fucking annoying.

I'm like this close to stop investing into newer projects and buying post reveal after I get to know founders and just insta flip every wl opportunity.

I'm actually so annoyed."
41,@Cambodius there is no intel - 60% of projects that are going to mint this month won't be here in months because founders can't take the heat and the other 20% are just straight up... YOINK RUG.
42,"Why is every project a fucking rug nowadays lmfao.
Legit - either it's a hard rug or a slow rug.

It's so fucking annoying.
I don't even lose in trades based on shit I can predict - I just get fucking rugged unexpectedly LOL."

Pay attention to the ecosystems that you're involved with.
