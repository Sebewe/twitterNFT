March 2nd 12pm pst  https://t.co/ViN93QrDqa"
1,@joefier That’s just because I force you and threaten violence if you don’t. But a view is a view!
2,"I just put out a new video on YouTube that walks through the most popular #PlayToEarn game of the moment, @PegaxyOfficial 

Check it: 👇 https://t.co/WSzi35Mlxu"
3,@John_Corey @RyanCarruthers Would still love some recommendations!
4,Easily the best @CyBallOfficial game footage you'll ever see! https://t.co/fFBHkjA5Cb
5,RT @naval: Crypto is the smartest people in the world exiting into their own economy.
6,"@RyanCarruthers @jayclouse @joefier Glad you enjoyed them. We’ll probably make it an annual tradition at this point. :)

We saw our show’s biggest growth ever during that month!"
7,Join us in the #PlayToEarn revolution! Let’s go! https://t.co/C3csi6qRrZ
8,We've been playing a lot of Pegaxy lately! Seems to be the best earnings in #playtoearn right now. https://t.co/A35YeymIQM
9,RT @hardforkgaming: The @hustleflowchart boys sit down with the one and only @cagyjan1 to discuss the opportunities that exist in #playtoea…
10,"The psychology of NFTs…

Person 1: I need to make rent, I’m going to sell an NFT. Floor is .5 so I’ll sell mine for .49 for a quick sale.

Person 2: Oh no! Floor’s dropping. Sell for .48 before it dumps.

Everyone else: ahhhh sell sell sell!"

13,"@thenicolascage @NeoshiNakamoto @naval There’s a fine line between shilling and educating. Those who get it, see it as education, those that don’t, see it as shilling."
14,"RT @cagyjan1: we will run a gaming studio one day.

Just keep that in mind."
15,@sdutKevinAcee Adrian is ok in my book. It’s just hard to root for any Dodger while they’re on the Dodgers.
16,@hector_podcast Until you get to 69 or 420… then everyone points it out!
17,@crypto_raiders 🔥🔥🔥
18,@SippinOnCrypto @Route2FI Is it actually playable yet?
19,@VanLifeIncome @Route2FI Try Thetan Arena.
20,@Route2FI Town Star is fun but earnings are crap since value of $TOWN crashed.
21,@hardforkgaming Just gonna casually drop the new logo like that with no mention. ;)
22,"@crypto_raiders Question: Once you bridge your $AURUM into the game, can you bridge it back out? I want to pull it out so I can use it to recruit…"
23,"NFTs can play with your head. I sold 4 yesterday from a project that I thought was fading, only to see that they tripled in value overnight. Doh!"
24,@PatFlynn @ColinandSamir Love their channel
25,@hector_podcast Editing out parts that don’t add more value to the conversation or aren’t entertaining.
26,@joefier @jakenstake @dbmoffatt Wait until you see what I built with the insights. :)
27,"@hector_podcast @RiversidedotFM We tried to record last one on Riverside to give it a chance. Our guests couldn't hear our audio very well no matter what we did. We gave up and went old school. Recorded over Zoom.

We're going to start recording with V-Mix in the future. Designed for video but does the trick."
28,"@hector_podcast @RiversidedotFM Ah crap. Hopefully I didn’t jinx it for you!

We used it for a year unscathed. Last 2 months… poop show."
29,@Zeneca_33 How to make a million dollars per year with NFTs with zero risk. Please. 🤞
30,@hector_podcast @RiversidedotFM Riverside has been a cluster-f lately. We’ve pretty much abandoned the platform at this point after our last few podcasts poor quality. We’ve completely stopped recommending it to anyone.
31,@jakenstake @dbmoffatt @joefier - check this thread out.
32,"This is fucking gold! Take this, make a spreadsheet to analyze, score projects, and make decisions based on the best scores. https://t.co/G4voaEjf1p"
33,@indiedropin That you need to charge sponsors on a CPM basis. Turns out it’s a pretty crappy metric to base sponsorships off of once you’re really rolling.
34,"Not to toot our own horn but @joefier and I called this coming about 2-years ago. Specifically these 2 companies too.

Spotify is acquiring two major podcast tech platforms https://t.co/aZKz4dOQUb via @Verge"
35,"Looking to buy and sell NFTs? Should you flip them quick or hold them long term? Do you know how to avoid the scams and rug pulls?

36,There’s alpha in this post 👇 https://t.co/wmbJrZKg48
37,@hector_podcast I pitch a new podcast idea about once a week and then @joefier has to remind me that we have to keep building businesses and that one’s enough. Lol
38,@ChouLaw2 @AxiePablo_ @hardforkgaming is building scholarships for both games as we speak. Follow and engage with the community over there for a shot at one of the spots opening in the next few days.
39,RT @APompliano: The Colorado Governor just announced that his state will begin accepting bitcoin for tax payments starting this summer.
40,@TranLiver_0904 @fractalwagmi @justinkan @YakuCorp Killer project and that shit moved fast!
41,@TranLiver_0904 @fractalwagmi @justinkan @YakuCorp Solana had issues with the volume during that launch. Hard to blame that on Fractal for that either…
42,@RiversidedotFM I see a lot of announcements about upcoming announcements on Twitter these days. I wish people would just make the announcement instead of announcing an announcement is coming.
43,@cenkarslan @MacBudkowski @web3talks @hustleflowchart @joefier We appreciate you! Thanks!
44,This is worth understanding. This is what @hardforkgaming is built around. https://t.co/YIpqStRx90
45,Things are getting exciting over here at @hardforkgaming 👀 https://t.co/eo0i2vPesn
46,@hector_podcast @RiversidedotFM Riverside has been nothing but problems for us for the past month. Not sure what’s going on now but our last 3 recordings have been a shit show. :-/

52,@JuddLegum I love the performance so much more now!
53,@cobie I think you’ve accurately described it actually.
54,Super Bowl = What I need to smoke to enjoy NFL football.
55,@cobie It’s what I need to smoke in order to care about NFL football.
56,My high school years flooding back to me from that one. I know I’m dating myself. I was in high school in the 90’s.
57,I’m rooting for the Rams because @weddlesbeard is on the Rams now. He used to be a SAN DIEGO Charger (and never an LA Charger). I don’t care about football anymore since my team left so it’s as good a reason as any.
58,@cagyjan1 Lol
59,Da da dada da… it’s the motha forkin’ D O double-G.
60,@PatFlynn I sang along to most of it. (Although I don’t know Kendrick Lamar’s music). Dre/Snoop/Eminem were on repeat in my car in high school.

62,"If you’re not following @cagyjan1, you really should be. He’s kinda crazy and talks about chopping his peepee off sometimes BUT I pretty much know most of what I know about play-to-earn gaming because of that kid!"
63,Absolutely love every point made in this. Worth printing. https://t.co/vXgGKFCcrN
64,"Being so far removed from that side of the media, the clips I see circulating from “mainstream” media all seem so ridiculous (regardless of what side of the political spectrum they fall on)."
65,I know I’m in my own echo chamber so honest question… Do people still pay attention to and buy into the narratives of mainstream news? I cut the cord to cable a decade ago and haven’t watched normal news since.
66,"@RyanCarruthers Message received loud and clear! ;)

We’re actually focusing H&amp;F just on audio again and developing a new show designed for video. Repurposing audio podcasts as video just hasn’t been very effective. 

Most people aren’t Rogan."

https://t.co/UB0TlPFEBA"
89,Agreed! Gaming too. https://t.co/X0bHECXbv2
90,"@RyanCarruthers @BrendanHufford If you get 20 downloads an episode, you’re a top podcast! 

Is that true? I don’t know. No one shares their numbers so let’s roll with it! :)"
91,"Do people really think that the play-to-earn standard is going to come out of a Blizzard/Activision/Microsoft/Valve/EA?

They’re looking to increase stock prices, not create mechanisms where gamers come out on top."
92,"@GageHarris_ @justinkan @Twitch So summing up this video. The play-to-earn concept should go away and stop trying to innovate because the current state of it isn’t ideal. Innovation bad. “Way it was” good.

Also if you play games, you add no value to society therefore deserve judgement on how you make a living."
93,"People entering crypto should think “what skill or value from my old career can I bring to this space?” instead of “how can I make money fast in crypto?”

The first question will take care of the second."
94,".@SynergyLandGame is doing an NFT mint right now. I'm super bullish on this game. Looks like Diablo II style gameplay but it's Play-To-Earn. Take a peek if you're into the gaming space. This game has a lot of potential.

These are the two that I minted. https://t.co/tDiDc3o5jW"
95,"Anybody remember Geocities? The metaverse is kinda like that, right?"

99,"Gaming tokens seem to be on a tear today. $RON up 13%. $MANA up 15%. $AXS up 17%. And GALA up 32%… in the last 24 hours!

Only a matter of time before gaming decouples completely from the larger crypto markets."
