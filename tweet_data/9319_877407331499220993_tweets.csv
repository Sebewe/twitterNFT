tl;dr: where trade_type != 'Bundle Trade'"
45,"@bakabhai993 Right I think this is the floor sweep from Genie and I don't think the USD amount or the raw amount is correctly reflecting what's traded in the transaction. Only 5 were traded instead of 22 and I think the Dune team knows that it's a bit cooked. 
Mabye @0xBoxer knows more"
