1,Feels like this is first-hand embarrassment... https://t.co/296sZxbSLw
2,RT @jasminecrowe: Goodr news @TheGoodrCo is bringing our Popup Grocery Market to #SXSW! Thanks so much to the unofficial Mayor @OneBandwago…
3,Honored to be doing this to help lift our community. Many people will be traveling into Austin unaware of the challenges that affect our neighbors everyday. Tomorrow I'll share more about the orgs that are joining me to do this AND how you all can help! Stay tuned! 🙏🏿 #DoGoodr https://t.co/NaTaC8XWhE
4,@jasminecrowe @TheGoodrCo Yes! Can't wait!
5,@adameargle 🙏🏿
6,@thecla923 Yes bro. Madness.
7,"@joshua_godby_ I parked at 10:03a and paid for an hour. 20 minutes later, the person types a ""O"" instead of a ""0"" and without considering common sense, puts a boot on my car which messed my schedule for the day."
8,@muvaofmarketing Right??
9,"@MelanieJonesTX Not a great start to the day, friend. 😔"
10,@merket No bueno
11,@mattyd02 @itsThatGirlKita Correct and didn't even use common sense to consider that they did a typo. And had the nerve to say that maybe EYE mistyped it in the machine. 🙃
12,@Tekvoyant @curvalish @BrianBrackeen Thanks y'all! Probably available in your state! I'm holding it down for SC!
13,"@PDXStephenG My first time ever, bro"
14,@samzoandco 🥺
15,@NancyFechnay Thanks friend!
16,"Haha I appreciate all the license plate love, y'all ♥️ 

They took the boot off (for free, of course) about 45 minutes later. My day was thrown off as I was late for pretty much every meeting afterwards but I'm going to relax at home and get ready for a more chill tomorrow. 🙏🏿 https://t.co/QUuvW4lKfa https://t.co/BzxG1SswEx"

23,"A reminder... Instead of spending 7 ETH on a Kevin, you could buy SEVEN Supporter Tokens and help 7 Black creatives get a membership into @Blackatxyz 🥺 👉🏿👈🏿  https://t.co/Xu5lRCRLoX"

27,@saadiq @0xOddrey It wasn't and I'm sorry. We should've announced that we were having an issue with CollabLand. I stepped away to read bedtime stories. Hope you're good now!
28,@jamesrichardfry @chiefgayofficer Definitely! @TheKofiAmpadu probably does too
29,@saadiq @0xOddrey is working on it - Sorry!
30,@mitacarriman @Blackatxyz Thank you! 🥺
31,@ElkanahReed @BenWalker037 @Blackatxyz @shondradanielle @0xOddrey 🙏🏿
32,Forgot to add the Link to the private group chat! Here it is: https://t.co/ZZvAgUBslD
33,"Lastly, if you bought a token but didn't click the link to join the private group chat, click the link below. As a reminder, @shondradanielle, @0xOddrey, are the Core Team and we will NEVER DM you asking you for money or to connect to any links."
34,"We will have more details announced tomorrow, including another event AND some of our members but for now, HAPPY MINTING! If the gas/transaction fee feels high to you, wait a little bit and try again when it's more reasonable.  https://t.co/u4sohmzyQ6"
35,"As we announced earlier, the FIRST IRL event will be hosted on March 14th here in Austin, TX during SXSW. Members and Supporters will get in free to enjoy an open bar, music, and the first opportunity to connect with the Black@ community in-person. More details to come! https://t.co/LI3inRsNpE"
36,"Second - and most important - is that with EVERY Supporter NFT sold, we will be GIVING AWAY a @Blackatxyz membership! This is how you build community and show up for others so we appreciate all of you for your support! https://t.co/Xu5lRCRLoX"
37,"We also know that we have many non-Black allies and supporters out there so we decided to mint a Supporter Token. This token works in 2 ways. First, it gives the holder access to all of the same benefits that the members have EXCEPT the private group chat https://t.co/Xu5lRCRLoX"
38,"As a reminder, we are reserving 125 NFTs for marketing, promotion, and giveaways and the remaining 500 are for sale starting with 125 memberships starting at 0.1 ETH. After those sell out, the price will go up to .3 ETH, then .5 ETH, and so on... https://t.co/R7Ec41Mo9d"
39,"As a reminder, we are creating Black@ for Black founders, founders, creatives, and collaborators. The private group chat is meant to be a safe and collaborative space for US! ✊🏿 If you want to learn more about the community, check out our FAQs here: https://t.co/x1gr3PiMIy"

58,So excited! Can't wait for y'all to check out this beautiful space. Mark your #SXSW calendars for March 14th! ✊🏿 @Blackatxyz https://t.co/6393bq8MgU
59,@tmcleod3 @tradeblock_us Yup! Sneaker trading platform. (Disclaimer: I'm an investor 😉)

The drop is tomorrow at 6pm ET. More details are here: https://t.co/tpX6INbao9"
75,@zsilvs303 I'm saying that 7 years ago I believed that. Now I don't. I even told @NancyFechnay the reasons. Every link you include is a call to action and an opportunity for distraction. I believe that there is a formula now.
76,"Randomly thought about the time that I was giving a talk and in answering a question about Founder Market Fit, I referenced Jay-Z's ""I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessing I can sell CDs"" line. A good founder offers more products to their current customers which improves CAC:LTV. 🧠"
77,@KarinDillie Welcome!
78,@KarinDillie This. https://t.co/6XB0dS09hK
79,@YesImThatNikki @TRich1914 I'll send y'all some right now in a text. You'll become a believer.
80,@TerriBWilliams @JetBlue @Bojangles It didn't 😩
81,@albreybrown @curvethots Ok. Glad to have opportunities to converse.
82,@zsilvs303 ???
83,"@albreybrown @curvethots Lol I'm not. I'm literally asking questions hence the question marks... 

The OP points to their idea of their central problem. You restated the problem with a different central point (the problem is low barrier to entry). It's ok to disagree but I was trying to get clarity."
84,@ncb000gt Definitely.
85,"@albreybrown @curvethots You said the NFT space is trash because of low barrier to entry opposing the OPs point about it being a buyer issue. Did I misunderstand how you reframed it?

Is it more than any other industry? More than gambling? MLM? I don't think there should be more barriers to making $$$."
86,@albreybrown @curvethots Your solution to the problem isn't more discernment for buyers but rather more barriers to entry for creators?
87,@YesImThatNikki And thank God for growth. 🙏🏿
