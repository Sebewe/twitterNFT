0,@Nikhilsulghur @zapper_fi https://t.co/93Pea660Xm does a good estimation on returns. Could be a little off.
1,"@Nikhilsulghur @zapper_fi We don't get taxed on our holdings either way so don't necessaruly need a value estimation tool.
Every sell order gives us the value on the day the asset was sold ( etherscan)
That helps workout approximate gains."
2,"@Ankit_A While a pain in my A**, yes. That's what I am doing."
3,@Nikhilsulghur Yeah you should. But you still need to figure out your expenses and account for all your trades so you can figure out your net income from the same. Of the top of my head I would have paid twice as much If I hadn't dug deep and figured the details.
4,"If anybody wants help breaking down your Etherscan transactions for NFT taxes this year, hit me up and I'll try sharing a template. It's not the best and has manual work to be done but I was able to wrap up working through 150+ transactions ( minor) and a quarter major ones."

29,@saadjhk @kayprasla onboarding users and allowing them to benefit without needing to understand every single detail about the blockchain will be vital. Just the way the internet works today. Cleaner onboarding experiences + obvious utility missing in the old world.
30,"@saadjhk @kayprasla True. + Most people do not have the bandwidth to comprehend the underlying tech while using a product/service that makes their life easier. As we build the world of gamefi, defi, digital assets &amp; other numerous use cases"
31,@adityashertg @TakeoffTone Yup. I am very careful and spend an awful lot of time just reading licensing agreements because of these sneaky founders.
32,"@saadjhk @kayprasla it's also cause talking about it rn seems to garner a lot of hate just because people associate it to its volatility, scams and other shortcomings which is obvious with any new technology. It's a slow process of educating people. We'll get there."
33,"@TakeoffTone Yeah I used to think it was an obvious part of any project. But lately I've noticed a lot of projects have decided to retain complete control of their IP and all we receive as a collectible series which was the ""first nft collection"" from the brand. Gotta stay sharp!"
34,@saadjhk @kayprasla Woah 40% is a lot. I'm calling more like a fraction. ( Not by market cap but by adoption and use cases)

46,"3. By falling for a phishing scam that reveals your keys or by signing a message blindly thus giving away control by your own will.

There is no other way for your BTC to be seized. By the time somebody decrypts your keys the universe would no longer exist."
47,"Let's clear this up for the sake of those that read:
1. The only way you lose your BTC is if don't own your keys. That means your assets are held by an exchange.
2. You expose your keys to the internet. By storing them online or on your devices that are connected. https://t.co/C7gWzJ7Kme"
48,@lolcatrises @deepakshenoy @daglihet Agreed and my point stands. You could be your own bank if you wanted to is what I'm trying to say. Those that chose not to bear the cost of potential financial censorship.
49,"@deepakshenoy @daglihet Anybody can point me to a government take over of BTC and I'll tell them how the keys were exposed not hacked. Also, as far as seizure goes BTC is the best bet for any country."
50,@deepakshenoy @daglihet Any other way of acquiring keys is by not storing them properly or storing them online. Which if anybody is smart enough to hold keys it's going to be a small percentage of those dumb enough to expose it to the internet.
51,@deepakshenoy @daglihet You Can't do it by brute force. The only way they can do it is if they physically abuse each one of us to reveal our 24 word seed phrases. An operation with a much heavier cost than the Cost of acquisition of the asset.🤷‍♂
52,"@AndyfromBharat @rejutm @srb_sh @daglihet Bank accounts not accessible etc was in context to countries where the citizens do not have access to financial services because of dictators and financial censorship. 
Doesn't make it illegal. It makes it the only way to truly own something."
53,"@AndyfromBharat @rejutm @srb_sh @daglihet Check where the conversation started. The reason I mentioned changing currencies is to display the need to not hold BTC because no, not even people that speak for BTC want it to be a currency. 
But that doesn't mean it can't transmit or store value.
You are free to choose."
54,"@rejutm @AndyfromBharat @srb_sh @daglihet Why is it so hard for you to comprehend that millions could be transacting on the network?
Read carefully. I said ""use the network"" 
They don't need to retain their BTC and can move in and out based on their needs.
Has nothing to do with the networks capability to transfer value"
55,"@AndyfromBharat @rejutm @srb_sh @daglihet Many have reported being unable to use their bank accounts. Crypto assets are the only thing you truly ever can own. Besides gold maybe. (Which has its own issues with security, maintenance, divisibility &amp; portability)"
56,"@AndyfromBharat @rejutm @srb_sh @daglihet Are you once again confused? You clearly are. Did you not read up that you don't need to hold the transferred value in BTC if you don't want to? Especially in countries where it isnt a problem yet?
In others where you wanna get away from censorship you bear the cost."
57,Or even our response to ignorance for that matter.
58,CT needs to stop telling people that they are NGMI or Have fun staying poor. We need to better in the way we respond to criticism.
59,"@AndyfromBharat @srb_sh @deepakshenoy @daglihet Your arguments could also be refuted by observing how  bitcoin  is able to provide access to millions of citizens of El salvador via the lightning network. 
Don't comfuse the price action of the asset to its ability to move value/energy from point A to B."
60,"@AndyfromBharat @srb_sh @deepakshenoy @daglihet once again people are confused between an open monetary network and the token that's used to access and transfer value across it.  
Every other currency is far better in the short term. The bitcoin network is the best solution to transfer value."

66,"@mryalamanchi @shek_dev I'm obviously excluding slow rugs. And accounting for projects that fail /succeed based on competence and know-how alone. 
On those grounds, yes, they've delivered.
Most projects arent even that sophisticated. So it's easier to deliver."
67,@mryalamanchi @shek_dev plenty! I could name quite a few that have over-delivered on their promises.
68,"@mryalamanchi @shek_dev That's fine. 99% nft projects are more tokens and less about art.
I wouldn't be buying any of these without their utility. Except for maybe a few."
69,@GatorMD97 My argument for that would be: Crypto isn't as efficient today without additional infrastructure (If it hasn't already been setup) and wouldn't really help Russia as much. Especially considering how traceable it is and I doubt they need the world to know their moves +liquidity

Next would be the remaining 10-15% could also be WIP.

Virtual 3D environments have less to do with the metaverse and more about a segment of the space that could power certain use cases."
93,"@adityashertg I find it extremely annoying that the narrative has flown towards the need to own a $500 device to be able to experience the metaverse.
Cons:
1. Massive exclusion
2. Limitations to use cases
3. Exhausting, definitely can't sustain engagement
4. Limits the true metaverse potential"
