36,"It's such a simple scam that I've seen countless times before but for some reason I was in a tired haze and just failed to spot it this time.

Thankfully I *only* lost 1.3 ETH. It could have been much much worse."
37,"It's a classic trick that I should never have fallen for, but sometimes when we're tired our brains don't work properly.

Lesson learnt. Always check to see if the person receiving the NFTs actually signed the mint transaction."
38,"Then I noticed all these big wallets hadn't actually sent any ETH for their tokens which seemed strange.

I did some digging and realised this was a fake contract which was sending the nfts to the big wallets to convince others to mint."
39,"So what happened.

I noticed what I thought were @WGMInterfaces being minted by some big wallets.

There was no mint button on the website but I just assumed some people had stumbled on the contract early so I minted 10."
40,"It finally happened. I fell victim to a minting scam.

Time away from NFTs combined with tiredness meant I wasn't as sharp as I should have been and I FOMOd.

71,"@creations_nft @gigigorlova To clarify; the baseURI will need to change for reveal if doing it over IPFS, as the CID will change if any of the data within changes.

That alone isn’t suspicious and there should be some kind of provenance to prevent devs from messing with the order."
72,"@creations_nft @gigigorlova I assume you’re talking about numbered json files inside an IPFS directory. 

Yes you can rearrange them and change the baseURI on the contract to the new CID, but this would be entirely public and any team doing that post mint would have some explaining to do!"
73,"@creations_nft @gigigorlova There’s definitely a lot of projects that serve metadata from their own API and have full control over who gets what yes.

You should be looking for projects that can provide a provenance hash pre-mint and who randomly set a starting index on the collection."
74,"@creations_nft @gigigorlova This is actually incorrect if a project is built properly.

A project can be built in a way that a random starting index is set once the collection has fully minted.

Even the developers won’t know who’s got what."
