20,"@NicoAltNFT @StarcatchersNFT So would it make you feel better if they faked one? When i started nfts, i got bored bunny. Roadmap n all, celebs promoting it, logan paul, dj khaled, mayweather all kinds of promotions, and it turned out to be a rug pull. Complete trash. Lost my money. So ya."
21,"@CryptopreneursC @NicoAltNFT @StarcatchersNFT I am not supporting invisible friends here, what am trying to say is road maps are “sometimes” nothing but BS. Lots of rug pulls have road maps. So it means nothing, but at least they are not faking it to sell anyone. This seems like a decent project, even not having a road map."
22,@BuzzFeed Is that why we’re paying $19.99 next month? They are making up for the cost 🤣

27,"@LFGHobbies @topshotfund @garyvee @LoganPaul Gary would never promote dump but logan prob. He promoted rug pull bored bad dump bunny n I fell for it💩 I was new though, had not gotten to know the scammers yet."
28,@NicoAltNFT @StarcatchersNFT A lot of rug pull projects give people phony road maps. Buncha BS. They mean nothing sometimes.

60,@metamomzilla @murtzahhh @StudioIrida @WomenTribe_nfts Lol be sure of what you click on. No matter who sends it
61,@murtzahhh @metamomzilla @StudioIrida @WomenTribe_nfts @Min_min372 He was one of the bots too. He didn’t mint one at a time. The dude swepts like 280 of them and sold them all already at .2 plus. all the real supporters who were there from the beginning n didnt get lucky to be on WL got nothing from public. Infact a lot of them lost $ in gas
62,@murtzahhh @metamomzilla @StudioIrida @WomenTribe_nfts Bro please. The last 2700 were gone in seconds by bots. No human got any. Everyone was frustrated about this yesterday and no one even addressed their frustration on discord.
63,@murtzahhh @metamomzilla @StudioIrida @WomenTribe_nfts But a lot of projects don’t get bought out by bots. Public had 0 chance.
64,@StudioIrida Cant wait!

81,"Support them through their difficult times or just don’t say anything. Keep the negativity to yourself and allow the 10k holders to hopefully recover from this. You may not agree with me and I don’t care, but I am thinking of the holders not the artist atm."
82,How are you empowering them? Give the artist a chance to fix her mistake and make things right. Stop spreading hate and negativity. You are hurting so many females. Just because you are not in the project shouldn’t allow you to trash it and cause others to lose their money. 2/3
83,"I don’t support artists copying other people’s work. But seeing so many females hate on @NFTCryptoChicks today is heartbreaking. I thought we were here to empower each other. By hurting the project, you are hurting the 10k other females who put their life savings in it. 1/2"
84,"@NFTs_girl To all those women trashing CC, a female project, saying you are here empowering females, you are also hurting 10 k other females. Allow the artist to make things right. Many people make mistakes. Think about all those women who put their savings into this project. Just saying."

89,@AngelPo91156060 @WomenTribe_nfts Been waiting for this for months. The first problem is them allowing pre-salers to mint 75% of the collection. And then left the public for bot. I’m very upset about this. No real human that supported them and waited for public got anything. Seriously done here.
