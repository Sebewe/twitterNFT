46,"15/ but seriously we just both enjoy sport and thought this was a cool concept. Would love to know the #nft twitter communities thoughts on a sport related NFT project like this.

#NFTCommunity #nftchat #NFTs #NFTGaming #NFTProject #NFTGiveaway #NFTCollection #nftcollectors"
47,14/ if the @NFL @EFL @OfficialFPL @premierleague @SkySports @NBA @nbatopshot @ESPNNBA @Bundesliga_EN @LaLigaEN @MLS @NHL need any advice on how to build this project... we here 😜
48,"13/ Obviously this is only an idea and not being made by myself or @iamlynchy. We just wanted to create a discussion and expand on what we know a lot of successful projects are doing. i.e. Tokenomics, rewarding users, gamification, art to buying certain NFTs, applying sport etc.."
49,12/ Wallets will only be able to hold a maximum of 5 players. So the game relies on communitys and people getting together to create the best team
50,11/ Each player will have a minimum of 3 seasons (this will be likely down to injury) but could have a maximum of 9. With a season expected to last 6 months
51,10/ A player will only last a certain season lifecycle before hitting retirement. These players could go into coaching but the reality is these players will burn. However once a wallet loses their player a new one will be allowed to be minted into the eco system
52,9/ To add to the player ecosystem. Drops will happen for additional NFTs like stadiums and training facilities. Which could improve players of times up your eth throughout a campaign
53,8/ The rewards system of weekly games is the players (NFT's) stats improving however come end of seasons winning teams will be reward back etherium for successful seasons
54,7/ Depending on the teams performance (success) and your player's (NFT) contribution stats can improve and diminish. Injury's and suspentions can apply and manager will have to tactically decide areas like aggression/playing style before games
55,"6/ With teams created leagues will be generated and depending on team selection, stats of players, conditions, a game will be played every Sunday at an identified time"
56,"5/ The manager can also identify assistants who can help with picking the team, if they are unavailable throughout a season"
57,4/ With you player now in your wallet you will have to be active to get the best out of your player. You can either create a team or join a team. The teams will make up a squad of 16 in this football example. The creator of the team will have to manage the team
58,3/ Once you have sucessfully minted your player will have a random position and stats to your player. For this example we'll use Soccer/Football
59,"2/ First minting each wallet would be allowed to Mint their own ""player"" for FREE. What would happen is you'd need to take a picture of yourself before minting. You won't be able to use celebrity images it would have to be your picture profile. https://t.co/XBzQGchgWi"
60,"1/ The Sunday League could be applied to Soccer, American Football, Basketball in thoery any TEAM sport"
