1,@zooko I understand that 'no excuse' part is acknowledge in the article. Just trying to add some context it.
2,"@zooko Here's an article about 'neo-nazis' from Moscow?! 
You have such morons in abundance in Eastern Europe, especially... 'nazionalism' is a very frequent mental disease there.. I know that well.. 

https://t.co/vVRYOhiuGp"
3,"@zooko I sure did. 

There's one party mentioned that currently has a single deputy from 450, that is 'far right' (neo-nezi). My point is that neo-nazis exist everywhere, unfortunately, and during military conflict over 'land' are easy to weaponize. Still, no excuses for Putin's war.."
4,"@zooko Unfortunately, neo-nazis are a big issue everywhere. Every European country has small groups of these associated usually with football hooliganism. In the US, individuals with similar views are running for Congress and/or storming the Capitol…"
5,"@zooko Unfortunately, you have these type of nationalists (neo-nazis) in every country in Easter Europe. Serbia, Bulgaria and Russia are no different. Greece too. In warfare, will be used the same way… Is that a good enough pretext for a fully fledged war on 45m population?"
6,"What’s happening now regarding capital pull from Russia is kind of what I’ve expected. Peace and non-violence are key marketing tools, while aggressors are major danger to capital! So, capital itself will tear the aggressor to the ground. Back to the middle age."
7,"@patrickjalbino @AhsanFarrall @WilliamandMaria @MayoIsSpicyy He's more of lapdog than ally.. Belarus was basically annexed to Russia by Putin, a year ago. The positive is that people there in large majority seem to want to get rid of Lukashenko. Matter of time..."
8,I've already donated but will continue to do so periodically until the conflict continues and likely afterwards. https://t.co/Zugz4lLvkE
9,"@sillytuna They can’t hold on to Ukraine, even of Kyiv and Kharkiv are taken over. It most likely will become a guérilla war and the moment his army disengage the government will be overthrown… Ukraine isn’t Russia .. and never will be.."
10,@sillytuna I guess was responding to Garry K.
11,"@sillytuna To be fair, Hitler was ‘evil’ pretty young. He wrote his infamous book in 1925 and was spouting poison well before. He was evil pretty early."
12,Making a uncensorable decentralized and globally distributed news platform would be as big an achievement as creating bitcoin. But how?!
13,"@krybharat It’s because people are not really using it to ‘build on top’ but simply reshuffle stuff to make a buck. That’s not CCO problem, more builder’s lack problem… But that will change with scale of adoption, imo…"
14,@twobitidiot ‘Beat’ but how? Economic sanctions are supposed to affect his army and make him rethink his strategy. All his kleptocratic friends and ‘collaborators’ had a good life… he screwed them all over in less than a week.
15,@punk4156 I guess countries will get some crypto holdings but can see why they would argue for CBDCs use for many businesses operations to be mandated. Weaponizing currency with ‘CBDCs’ would however be even more obvious. 🤔
16,@punk4156 That might be unconstitutional though and in a way a defeat for crypto. My guess would be that off-ramps would be even more controlled. And inter-state affaires would be enforced even longer on rails that can be controlled. -&gt; Less institutional adoption. Just guessing.
17,@Pauly0x That's as lame as dumb... really! fu
18,@0xTopa @andersostlund That's fairly irrelevant statement though... They did vote the right way on the important sanctions. Even Orban..
19,@michaelL771 @leashless Someone’s been watching too much RT.
20,"@leashless Agree. Only, I feel attacking Ukraine made that predictable. No sane person will try to invade an European country of 45m like that… Putin did go too far…"
21,"@0xCR0509 @iamDCinvestor China does much more business with the West, even despite the recent ‘trade war’. Plus, they have a massive USD reserve. So, that’s my rationale. I hope once the current situation is resolved (and Putin’s gone), everyone comes along. We all have more to lose than win from wars."
22,"@mdudas @Dictionarycom Thanks, have been wondering about that for sometimes and was lazy to ask.."
23,@0xCR0509 @iamDCinvestor Can you find the numbers of Russia trade incomes?! Then you get the picture… EU is their main market. They just fucked themselves so badly.. not just by the sanction. They made Germany change their politics on energy and defense…
24,@tbr90 ‘Retail’ is saying that for 10 years. Most don’t know shit about what they are talking. What is happening is that a lot of people have also stopped caring about random tiktokers. Panicked retail’s coins will go to companies and states.
25,"@iamDCinvestor That would have been on the table anyways, is what I mean. 

Logistics and money rails and business interactions over decades are not something you re-tool for a few months, though… 

If I was at Xi place, rather deal with West than with a megalomaniac (neighbor!) dictator."
26,@iamDCinvestor Doubt it. China knows business and its products aren’t going towards Russia. It also knows where the moral high ground here is. They will likely push for a digital yuan to slowly emerge as alternative to USD.
27,@ChainLeftist You continue with the wild assumptions. Not the appropriate time to argue about it…
28,"@ChainLeftist A) So why have that conversation. When I was protesting Palestine bombings you were likely in high school. So, cut your virtue signaling BS. 

B) It’s a wild and dumb assumption. Can guarantee once actual nazis are governing UKR, will fight them otherwise than with tweets.."
29,@ChainLeftist There are more nazis in US Congress than Ukraine douma..
30,@ChainLeftist There are far-right and neo-nazis in every country. Using that as pretext to wage an invasion of what is a liberal democracy is a crime. Facts are these are not represented in the politics in any meaningful way to justify the propagandist excuse and denominator.
31,@ChainLeftist Who is ‘nazi’ in their Gouvernement? There’s 1 deputy from a far right party in the parliament. That’s the dumbest putinist propaganda for the past 20 years… so cut the crap..
32,@balajis They are fucked
33,@ChainLeftist And btw many were opposed to it at the time… but it isn’t our generation as it started 20 years ago…
34,"@ChainLeftist With the difference that Iraq was ruled by another blood sucking dictator, while Ukraine is a liberal democracy. The war was wrong and under false pretenses but not the same narrative. Expect in the minds of poorly informed ‘what about’ Putin apologists…"

41,@TennesseeJed3 @0xTjo @BillyMcSmithers @Debussy100 @ArtOnInternet @CullenColors @radiosolace @MFPOOMA Absolutely. : ) SAMOgans are vault material.
42,@bantg Is that true?
43,"The problem with contradictions is that they usually stem from contextual thinking. 'Hot water is good!' and 'Hot water is bad!' are both true/wrong depending of context. Most people use 'system 1 thinking' to stop at 'contradiction' aspect, going for the 'gotchu' moment."
44,"@Pauly0x Needs more data. The consequences of COVID can expend over years. You could stay 20 days in coma, get out of it and still die a year later of poor health. It's difficult to find causalities with simple correlations like this one..."
45,"@TP_CEO_of_TPI @tbr90 I hope so. Everyone has so much more to win by simply trying to do commerce and exchange. Even Russia, which unfortunately has been 'occupied' by Putin's regime, caring exclusively for itself."
46,@tbr90 @PeterZeihan The economic losses with mass scale confrontations between these powers should be the biggest deterrents. Russia is strongly affected by 2014 sanctions and will be  much worse after the past two days. Not sure about the 'over leveraged' part. Need the look at numbers.
47,@tbr90 Agree. I just don't see what China wins from such actions. Why have your image tarnished like that when you do so much business with the free world!?

55,@carolineradish There’s corruption but Ukraine is functional democracy… despite all attempts from Russia to prevent that…
56,@carolineradish But there’s obviously a side to take.. Ukraine has its own state and laws… period
57,@carolineradish Pretty much yes… accurate
58,@Greekdx NATO*

63,It was alarming when they (Kremlin) green-lighted the assassination attempt of Navalny. A clear sign that he's loosing grip of reality...
64,"@adeliechic It was technically a 'country'. Also, has its own ethnicity.  Ukraine is on the the biggest countries in Europe as a territory and population."

76,"@phunk2243 @HeidiBriones They are not really filtering anyways but it seems efficiency is pretty good if all participants wear one. Ofc, it would be also influenced by other factors."
77,"@HeidiBriones Could be anyone. Ideally you (or whoever) wears an FFP2 mask but an 'ordinary' surgical mask would be good enough if everyone wears one indoors. The first 'increase' your odds of not getting contaminated, the second the odds of not contaminating someone."
78,@HeidiBriones You only wear surgical masks and replace/recycle them on daily basis.
79,"@0xinc @warandnoise The way I understand it however is that to paraphrase 'this is a stage 1 of 40' or something like that regarding the planed development. It's a small piece in a much bigger edifice. In that regards it makes sense to have it all integrated from the beginning, imo.."

86,"@0xinc Possibly. I don't know really. I think the token itself creates more its own problems - balancing the in-game 'tokenomics' but not sure if it adds any technical issue around the game itself. The game relies on 'market trades of items etc', and adds utility for the cats..."
87,@0xinc What I would have done differently is let people pay their transactions and no bother with that. Perhaps facilitate the whole gaming?! Txs on Polygon are cents so no need to be 'extra kind' and make these 'free' especially if that creates technical issues...
88,"@0xinc Nothing wrong really. The ideas are good, the execution less so BUT no one has done or is doing anything remotely close from the PFP-based projects, at least to my knowledge. It would take ~a month to adjust to all variables, many of which are infrastructure related."

90,@GrantYun2 Love this one.. Superb! 👏💎🔥
91,"@cory_eth Because the wear masks, I presume? 

Mask mandates are only for indoors here and heard that in California, the mandates have been removed now.. So, I guess, depends a lot where you live."
92,"@cory_eth You mean you currently live in an area/city with COVID-related 'mandate', which restricts you and others from going outside and having 'norma' daily social activities?"
93,@cory_eth Do people still have 'mandates'? Like lockdowns? Where? I've heard that's the case in some Asian countries now.. (to some extent). No one in Europe has any currently..
