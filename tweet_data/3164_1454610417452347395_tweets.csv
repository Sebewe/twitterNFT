91,"imo, artists should do some experiments on each platform to verify how NFT works. There are a lot of questions we have to answer like How to build the business model with NFT? How NFT affect their fans? What's the value of NFT?

(4/n)"

In terms of the ROI, purchasing royalty NFT does not make sense. But I expect how they are playing out.

If you buy music NFT on .@soundxyz_  or @catalogworks, you will get the ownership of this song and a source file of the song. And you can sell it on secondary.
