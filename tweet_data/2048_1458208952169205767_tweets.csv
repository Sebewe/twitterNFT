0,@3rdeyeNFT @AzukiZen You’re already part of The Garden homie. Looking forward to the day you rock that pfp 🤙🏼
1,@latteicecoffee 😪😭 learn how to lock pick yet?
2,@latteicecoffee Dude I just found mine. So priced out. So heartbroken
3,@imlenti No more hype.
4,@AzukiSales I just got chills seeing this one. 😭😳
5,@JustmaikoNFT @NFTGrandMaster @AzukiZen Brooooo. Set up an ATL one 😭
6,@Thexdsignr Wait for dip. Buy soul back. Profit.
7,@latteicecoffee Wait that can happen 😳 I been on some sketch sites.
8,@OttoSuwenNFT @AntonymNFT Fair.
9,@OttoSuwenNFT @AntonymNFT BUT. So soon to mint? How many people will actually listen this soon to mint. It gives no one time to write it off as FUD or see that it’s a valid concern.
10,"@OttoSuwenNFT @3LAU I mean…I agree. But you can’t deny that the timing is dumb. It’s not like he hasn’t been in the space and or heard of Antonym until today…I don’t even disagree with what he’s questioning, just with the timing of it."
11,@OttoSuwenNFT The timing is a little dumb though. Antonym has been around for a minute. Why not make this challenge a week or two ago? Or even a few days ago as opposed to their mint day. Surely they have a lot going on today…🙃
12,@LonelyStoner365 Yes. Exactly this. LOL
13,@LonelyStoner365 But what isn’t right 😂😭 making me anxious LOL
14,@LonelyStoner365 Dude. Me too…idk why or what exactly it is that hit me. But it wasn’t good lol.
15,"Soooo, am I the only one who just started thinking…wait, what the actual fuck? Or was that a collective thing?"

83,@krislieberman1 @sleepyavocad0 @RAREBANDY Agreed…idk man. I’m sad for everyone who minted. Huge bag loss.
84,@sleepyavocad0 @krislieberman1 @RAREBANDY I legit can’t even determine what that is.
85,@NFTooPerfect My Hero and SAO?? Feathers ruffled…
86,@krislieberman1 @sleepyavocad0 @RAREBANDY Pain. Pure pain.
87,@sleepyavocad0 @RAREBANDY Dude. Same. I kept asking so many people if it was real. I thought it was some organized FUD or something LOL.
88,"@RAREBANDY @sleepyavocad0 Well, the sneak peaks looked dope tbh. And it was meant to be playable, maybe p2e? Idk, never hopped on the train. But that looks neither dope OR playable."
