1,"@dearearth_ Yeah, that sometimes is the most effective way to manage it! Now you just need to not have it open as a tab 24/7 :p"
2,"@dearearth_ Interested to hear how this goes for you ;)

You'll have to let me know if you used Focus mode or something similar to stop the notification creep."
3,"It’s refreshing to see @BossBeautiesNFT announcing scholarships, mentorship opportunities, and internships. 

Impact programs like these have the same sizzle as merch drops and big Web2 partnerships.

Let’s do more 💪

P.s. Also don’t get me wrong, love me some merch as well ha"

Would have it contained in a @fractional_art vault after we raise the funds."
