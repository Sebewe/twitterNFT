0,I 100% support @ashnichrist ! White fans quoting @kanyewest lyrics is NOT racist. As a black man this is NOT the accountability / witch hunting we want. We want REAL racists to be held accountable not people enjoying lyrics that stream publicly for billions of people to “enjoy”.

63,For every minute I spend on Twitter/Discord chasing the dopamine rush of information I’m committing to match that time per day in meditation. Web3 &amp; this space needs balance. Our mental health needs balance. This is a sure way to filter the noise. #MentalHealthMatters #NFTs
64,"Send me a list of #DAOs that are focused on supporting “the culture” of creators from our community. Fashion, Music, Art, Tech, Education, Film, Finance etc? If we don’t have them yet. Then let’s build them! #WEB3"

73,It typically takes 3-5 years for a footwear brand to turn a profit. @RTFKTstudios got acquired by @nike after 2 years of existence and about 1 year of going super hard in the #NFT space. Safe to say this is indicative of the power of #NFts and #community 🚀
