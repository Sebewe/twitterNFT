66,"Because of the consistent utility that their tokens were providing to the game, economy and players.

Its utility and community that the market is hungry for and rewards.

If you can find the right project early enough you can enjoy a nice rocket ship to the top. 

GL everyone"
67,"2021 brought about major awareness to this niche with the rise of @AxieInfinity and other projects that followed.

During the last major dip in 2021 while most tokens were down significantly, axie infinity was on an upward trajectory. Why?"
68,"If you hadn't guessed it by now its the blockchain gaming space. 

Gaming has always been one of the biggest industries in the world and is constantly growing. 

Gaming has the ability to connect everyone from so many different backgrounds, and guess what? Web3 is all about unity"

83,"3. The Roadmap doesn't seem farfetched 

There are A LOT of projects in this space that are sharing so many buzzwords in their white paper about what they will do but in reality things promised will take years. 

This project has a believable timeline and team for execution."
84,"Normally when NFT projects say that are ""creating a game"" they have never done so before and don't have anyone on the team that can execute. 

The studio behind this project actually has done so in the past and let you see their work."
85,"2. They have a team that can deliver and have delivered before 

The @foxfamnft is created by an actual design studio out of London that have been doing this exact process for quite sometime."
86,"1. Art is unique
