26,@AlexMasmej Bowling!
27,@GeoffStengel @SuperRareRoses @SuperRare I think it’ll be up to artists to advocate for it being a deal breaker for using their platform
28,@GeoffStengel @SuperRareRoses @SuperRare i think royalties are here to stay. the nice part about the blockchain is everything is public so you can check the royalty engine address on etherscan and see which contracts are calling it (via internal transactions) and which are not
29,"@GeoffStengel @SuperRareRoses @SuperRare the issue is every marketplace has their own, different way of encoding royalties (these existed pre EIP-2981) which is why they pop up as zero. this is why the global registry was created, now we just have to push everyone to use it so everyone can get paid"
30,@GeoffStengel @SuperRareRoses @SuperRare if youre talking about royalties on other platforms this is a bigger issue and why we've partnered on https://t.co/URCMzPCUNJ which any marketplace can hook into to ensure that everyone gets royalties regardless of where the nft was created
31,@GeoffStengel @SuperRareRoses @SuperRare 0xb932a70A57673d89f4acfFBE830E8ed7f75Fb9e0 is the 721 contract associated with the superrare token so it itself will not pay royalties. those will come from the superrare marketplace contracts

44,@humangallardo @SamuelDrozdov @wwhchung For that you’d have to look into a platform that does lazy minting or something on polygon or an L2
45,"@humangallardo @SamuelDrozdov Manifold is a good option, this might fit in to their existing extension system @wwhchung"
46,@SamuelDrozdov @humangallardo Damn that’s a bummer. You should start up your own contract and have a trade in system for the first 603 and new tokens are minted starting at 604
