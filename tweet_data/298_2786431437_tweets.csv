0,@ExtremelySunnYK I’m utilizing a mechanic similar to this contract’s SVG renderer in a personal project so this ended up being extremely useful.
1,"@ExtremelySunnYK No but that’s a good idea!

Mostly just pick things day-by-day from stuff I’ve heard of.

Today I went through this: https://t.co/0ZDSbzw9Rj"
2,@tkoutsaplis Player is en-route so I should be good soon but I appreciate that 🙏🏼
3,"Most of these have been interesting NFT contracts.

The creativity of the code is beautiful to me.

(DeFi contracts and devs are absolutely galaxy brain and my smol brain will try and tackle some of those soon)"
4,"@tkoutsaplis Enjoyed the live event!

Don’t have a stem player so unfortunately haven’t listened beyond that yet."
5,"@shanebreslin Thinking about doing something like this.

This is a pretty good starting point with a lot of examples on basic concepts: https://t.co/wcyrhBSGwU

This is good too for more general overview stuff: https://t.co/UnaqmkfbOK"
6,"I could study deployed smart contracts forever.

Been digging through a new contract every day this month and it’s genuinely my new favorite hobby."
7,Future slowed is also S-tier

9,@remnynt Last night I had a debate for like 30min with myself whether a function should be getTokenTraits or getTraitsByTokenId and I realized either would be fine and I was wasting my time lol
10,"RT @usleepwalker: My Ukrainian credit cards don't work anymore. I'm safe physically in Kazakhstan, but all my savings are gone.

Crypto is…"
11,May or may not have just pre-ordered my Mega City Merch from @chain_runners 👀 https://t.co/lgX5LMCDTu
12,"@PaikCapital That’s really, really bad."
13,"@rsg Of course, to top it off, they have laser eyes."
14,"Humanity has access to a golden age unlike anything in history.

Unfortunately, we refuse to build the infrastructure that would allow for it. https://t.co/DDuaIZt4YH"
15,Crypto does really well with the “What will seem super obvious in 20 years?” test.
16,@wolfejosh Brilliant!
17,"@pummer We probably agree more than we disagree here.

Just circling back to state my original criticism here which is that politicians spewing “the right is on Russia’s side” is an egregiously horrible thing to be doing right now."
18,"@pummer Again, not trying to be adversarial.

Just think this way of thinking is recklessly dangerous and generally hypocritical.

Not a critique of you - a critique of most political thinking in the US."
19,"@pummer Strongly disagree.

This is a dangerous way to think, and unfortunately, it’s very prevalent in the US.

The irony here is that these opinions are proliferated by the left version of people like Tucker Carlson.

Same thing, different side of the aisle."
20,"@pummer Don’t know what you’re referring to. I don’t pay attention to or care for them.

But if you think that literally half of US citizens’ opinion is reflective of a handful of TV talking heads, then you are lost.

Not trying to be adversarial.

But that’s scary if you think that way."
21,"@pummer If anyone believes this, then shame on them.

Seriously.

If you genuinely think that right-leaning people are on Putin’s side then you have been completely corrupted by extreme left wing media.

Sad."
22,"And I am completely unaffiliated with any political party for the record.

This should be something the right and the left both condemn.

Does absolutely nothing but divide people."
23,"US Congressman in CA.

Disgusting behavior.
https://t.co/lq6lKkJXNL"
24,"Seeing official United States government representatives Tweeting out things along the lines of “Republicans are cheering Putin on” is absolutely abhorrent.

Shame on anyone peddling that rhetoric right now."
25,"Citizens praying in Ukraine right now.

I really take life, peace, and prosperity for granted. https://t.co/U8HBIeAYI0"
26,"@JacquiHeinrich Good work, Twitter."
27,"Lot of emotions flying around.

People are already on edge from 2 years of Covid.

Now is the time to love and support your family, friends, and neighbors.

Spread compassion, positivity, and optimism.

Lift up all those you encounter."
28,RT @VitalikButerin: Очень расстроен решением Путина отказаться от возможности мирного решения спора с Украиной и вместо этого начать войну.…
29,@VitalikButerin Appreciate you standing up for human rights.
30,"The last thing I want to do is be political here.

Not the time to be throwing zingers and pointing fingers.

But it’s also extremely concerning to me that Biden, who clearly isn’t 100% there, is our current leader, and that he will be addressing the country tomorrow - not now."
31,"Sorry mom for the language, but fuck Donald Trump.

Russia is invading Ukraine right now and he hops on Fox News to stroke his ego and talk about how this wouldn’t have happened if not for a “rigged election.”

What an absolute garbage tier leader and human being."
32,"Putin effectively just declared war on Ukraine.

Praying for the world."

Good day."
35,@raxtechbits @PaikCapital I can definitely get on board with that
36,@PaikCapital Minecraft music also good.
37,@fvckrender It’s not a coincidence that the best people in the space are collectors.

48,"@dfinzer Sending good vibes to you and your team.

Really unfortunate you’ll all take a lot of completely undeserved blame.

Appreciate what you’re building!"
49,"@hudsonjameson It’s terrible.

People practicing absolutely terrible security with extremely high-value assets, getting phished, and then blaming it on the tech.

And it proliferates and outsiders view it as insecure tech…"
50,@dapperjman I hope many influencers in the space use this as an opportunity to push a lot of asset security content out
51,"It’s clear not enough people understand this…

A hardware wallet alone does not solve all of your Ethereum security issues.

Keep that wallet cold.

Do not use it to interact with *any* contracts.

Have a cold storage hardware wallet that is exclusively for transferring to/from."
52,@then_there_was It’s tremendous
53,@remnynt I thought it was a joke at 1st and then I realized “oh he’s serious” hahaha
54,I 100% live in a simulation because I refuse to believe these people are real
55,Dude wants to hard Fork Ethereum right now lmfaooo
56,Some guy is going off about how Vitalik needs to take charge right now and I’m losing it 😂
57,Can confirm that I have *not* yet seen Justin Trudeau and the hacker in the same room.
58,Are we absolutely sure that the Canadian government isn’t behind this NFT exploit???
59,"Anyone trying to make sense of some of the oddities around this “hack” shouldn’t.

Anyone this technically competent and organized is a galaxy brain hacker.

They likely don’t even care about the money.

They’re just doing this because they can."
60,Best info I’ve seen so far regarding the NFT “hack” happening rn. https://t.co/vz07O9EkGj
61,"Looking through “hacked” accounts and I don’t think this has anything to do with X2Y2 (at least at the contract level).

Way too many of them have never interacted with it."
62,"If you’re in the “openSea is under attack?!” space for the love of god don’t listen to anything they’re saying.

90% of it is just so, so, sooo bad."
63,"Revoking is good, but I do worry about people deploying copycat revoke websites that are malicious.

If you’re not technical it’s hard to identify them.

Transferring to a new wallet avoids this."
64,"@then_there_was “Don’t transfer it to a new wallet it’s just panicking you could get hacked!”

No buddy that’s not how it works lol"
65,"To the people saying “no I didn’t get phished” - yeah you did.

Nobody can take your assets this way unless you signed something you shouldn’t have.

Sending it to a new wallet means that wallet is completely free from any contract interactions.

AKA no signatures &amp; no access."
66,"Listening to all of these spaces with fairly large Web3 influencers with person after person giving absolutely awful advice.

If you have *any* concerns about your NFTs being compromised, transfer them to a brand new Ethereum wallet and do not interact with any contracts."
67,@_anishagnihotri @RoscoKalis You’re a legend for this
68,"Can confirm that the Revoke Cash redeploy from @_anishagnihotri at https://t.co/hz6gIeQ300 is legit.

Always confirm by yourself, but as you can see here the revoke contract does exactly what it says it does.

Hope this helps someone if https://t.co/IaDYNnFxBP is down. https://t.co/M83LmBfj2Q"
69,@andrwwang @_anishagnihotri Can confirm the contracts it has you sign are legit.

74,"@web3mark Love L2! I actually have a separate idea that requires more active transactions that I’ll want to try out on L2 (unsure which one yet).

All of my DeFi usage is now on L2 between Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync."
75,@web3mark Nice MEV miner btw :)
76,@web3mark Ethereum L1. Will be using ERC721A to help people with gas costs.
77,"Been working on an NFT project for fun during my spare time.

Experimenting with several mechanics I think are really cool - some tried &amp; true and some brand new.

There will be a game component that ties the whole thing together.

A+ interactivity.
