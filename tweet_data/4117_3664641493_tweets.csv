1,@Degentraland @doodles I suspect a strong floor with only the non humans going for a premium. Most of the human doods will likely be comparable  in price
2,@mondoggg @clichedraws Man I need to send some bids people giving these away lol.

23,"@TheBlondeAlex @AndrewSteinwold Lol. So they outsourced their actual product to a random company know body has ever heard about.
Ya this doesn’t end well."
24,"@brandonmighty @SuperRare @nounsdao Great, now I need to set aside eth for 1/1"
25,@codeerror_ @objktcom @hicetnunc2000 😁
26,@EvoTheCurator What ya working on sir
27,"@DeanSamed Tezos is the best kept secret in nft art. I suspect this time next year several of these artists on tez will be some of the biggest artists in nfts. The artwork is unmatched to any chain, especially for how small it is."
28,@g13m @doodles Vacuum dood
29,@jstn It’s so fun lol.
30,"RT @wabdoteth: WHO WANTS SOME FREE PIXL PETS!?

31,@iamdos L.A is popping for web3 and nfts. I suspect is becomes the nft capital for the U.S as Hollywood goes all in on nfts.
32,@BillyMcSmithers @ununkx @Punk_2070 Bullish on tezos art big time! Only a matter of time before it catches fire
33,@punk4156 @brandonmighty Uhhhh I need this

38,@ellepleurenft @doodles .76
39,@0xBender and its at 11 lol
40,@0xBender I don’t think the market will be kind to established brands who struggle to execute. Floornwent from 16 to 12.5 when pets got pushed back. If it doesn’t mint today I could see it go to 11
41,@raidparty liking the new rules. still new that WL to go with my genesis. :)
42,"RT @raidparty: Our Presale Mint starts tonight at 10PM EST! 🥳

47,@YsaeNFT @doodles DCA is my new favorite term Doodle cost averaging lmaooo
48,"@pranksy @poopie @doodles @CryptoKitties if you don't own at least 1 crypto kitty and 1 doodle, you ngmi"
49,"lucky enough to be one of the winning bids. This one going to the vault along with 8 others from @brandonmighty 

If you haven't seen Brandon's work, I suggest scooping some up as its some of the best on OBJKT and TEZ. https://t.co/Cr2rAI7brP"
50,"RT @brandonmighty: All offers have been accepted
We had 383 total offers, insane. 👀 Thank you so much all.

This demand continues to floor…"
51,@CozomoMedici @Spotify @joerogan I liked you better when it was just GM posts and NFT's.
52,@philrayho @punk3178 @doodles this is the way

55,@mrnftgod @doodles welcome dood
56,@TheMauiWowi @doodles Someone sweep this
57,@mondoggg @brandonmighty Welcome fellow dood. Brandon’s stuff is awesome. I grab as much as I can
58,"@tommyk_eth @Degentraland @BoredApeYC @doodles @AzukiZen @worldofwomennft @coolcatsnft @RTFKTstudios @HAPEBEASTGANG @cryptoadzNFT BAYC has done the best job, but who else? NT? Kongz? Etc? Out of 20k projects only 10 or less have legit utility."
59,"@tommyk_eth @Degentraland @BoredApeYC @doodles @AzukiZen @worldofwomennft @coolcatsnft @RTFKTstudios @HAPEBEASTGANG @cryptoadzNFT I’m not sold in NFT utility at this point in time. Outside a few very special brands, nobody has nailed legit utility."
60,@TrainerLuisCR I was sleeping on it. So much good stuff
61,@0xBender Wild stuff lol
62,@Punk_2070 Crazy how many nft folks have never touched defi. They all have bright eyes with these nft tokens which 90% will be dust in two months
63,@timoshisuen @doodles Welcome dood
64,@greatbuy2012 @ThinkingUSD This comment wins
65,@pranksy @doodles Demon flip
66,@Punk_2070 @catdirtyart Love cat dirty got a few myself
67,@0xBender Lol what did u post?
68,"@Punk_2070 Matic works fine, you just need to have a reliable rpc. Solana has always been bad. Networks get tested when markets dump"
69,@GOLDSMOKE10 @drippyarteth @JeeniusETH https://t.co/dJtqIW3cbT
70,@ashrobinqt Wtf u mean it’s closed why don’t I have an invite sir
71,@NFTmachine That didn’t age well
72,@Julian_Holguin @doodles Welcome fellow L.A dood
73,@mignano @doodles welcome
74,@ashrobinqt ay yoo
75,@danielesesta But do you own wagmi.nft or .eth?
76,@OrtegaMedici Oxo
77,@tomkysar @poapxyz Seriously.
78,@wgmiio $1000 a year for portfolio tracker? Seems steep plenty of good free ones
79,@PuffYatty lol at not listing doodles. yall NGMI
80,@Mr312 @doodles both
81,@Abs0lutelywrong need when?
82,@GOLDSMOKE10 https://t.co/fUsFtjWR24
83,"Since doodles going to the moon, here’s a video of my vans slips being made! Epic! https://t.co/Ea5qOMDokM"
84,@danielesesta It has to dump before it can moon. Last stop all aboard FTM world
85,@NathanHeadPhoto @NathanHeadPhoto why does it go down? What type of problems do they suffer from? Curious as I’m in expert in observability/IT ops and would love to know what their trying to fix and how they pinpoint issues.
86,@danielesesta Bring some real utility to NFTs. All the exsisting utilities are pretty weak and don’t have the defi ecosystem behind them to do well long term.
87,@Abs0lutelywrong You actually hit #2 after that 150 listed tez piece sold! I added a few as well to help!
88,@wonderpiesNFT Juicecounty.eth
89,RT @drippyarteth: @AdamBombSquad @thehundreds glow in the dark 💣✨ https://t.co/pB0x1KSwnn
90,@HollanderAdam @CNBC @BoredApeYC @HungryWolvesNFT Really wel spoken especially in a live interview on national TV. You championed that the right way for web3
91,@bernardo_cafe This app is nice lol. Gunna use it up today
92,@ashrobinqt @CryptoBatzNFT Doods headed to 6 which is insane
93,@cerealclubnft I’m game
94,@prgrssnx @AlexGilbertson Yoooo we have a lot of similar art on fx.
95,@_desultor_ Grabbed some of your stuff on tez. Glad to see you that chain!
96,@BiggsCrypto Gamers hate in game economies and pay to play models. They see it as a potential cash grab which they are not wrong. I think once someone converts exsisting items into NFTs and there is only benefit to the player. P2E will make standard games obsolete.
97,@JeeniusETH @coolcatsnft @evankeast and @doodles is a good example.
98,"Lots of talk about P2E games, but I have yet to find one I really like. DFK is the closest thing to gamification in the defi space. I suspect in the next 6 months we could see it compete with Axie for dominance. https://t.co/0H0P6mahoY"
