5,@moses23__ If you’re talking about buying and accepting a high offer right away then this has been around for awhile and isn’t a scam.

7,How you guys feel about @SatoshiRunnerz ? Good staking project? Or we going to see reveal and 3 week delay on tokenomics? Don't see much value of the token yet.. I'm not a big fan of the 'use tokens for white list spots on future projets'..
8,@zkpawky @doodles I was hoping to see a space shark :D
9,Actually surprising how few @coolcatsnft cool pets are listed. You'd think it was a staking project or something.
10,@0xQuit @RiceFarmerNFT @moses23__ @opensea @BoredApeYC Gwei for the 22eth buy was only 69. Crazy. Typically bots ramp up the Gwei to guarantee the purchase when a big buy and weth offer difference is detected.

59,Wait what! :D https://t.co/hy7JqaJG73
60,My worry for tokenify or and other platform looking to expedite the smart contacts for NFT projects is saturating the market with random projects and rug pulls. Perhaps it’s worth it to allow creative minds to push out their work without needing to find a dev they can trust.

In the meantime it looks like @themetroverse @CritterzNFT  and a few other staking p2e games are doing alright. Been having some fun with them. Never played minecraft before today."
66,At least @LooksRareNFT was responsive to the community. So far @the_x2y2 just posting random stuff to try to deflect. Hope I’m wrong though as a platform with bulk listing is what we needed.

77,@JfellzZ @NiftyReport @doodles I can see this.
78,@Vitalz1000 @doodles I think part of it is to showcase a small sliver of what you can do in web3. not many projects right now allow you to change and undo things with your nft. Granted it’s not difficult but it’s newer features.
