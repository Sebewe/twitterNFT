3,What’s truly important in life? Today’s been an opportunity to reconsider this question. It’s easy for us to get caught up in the “fluff” esp in this space. Let’s not forget the health &amp; safety of our friends and families that we take for granted most days. Praying for Ukraine 💔

29,"@crypto_coven I’ve learned to be intuitive in listening to my body/mind when I need to take creative breaks (&amp; not feel guilty about it). I’ve also utilized this awareness to guide an equal energy balance in various relationships and when to let go😌

38,"There’s a very interesting conversation going on in regards to the Crypto Chick artwork &amp; plagiarism. In theory, yes, a lot of art is “copied” - art inspires art. But this is literally stolen. Blaming your age + ignorance isn’t enough when you’re on a project raising millions $. https://t.co/H1U93Cuf2S"

56,@claire_salvo @danieljohnson amazing! Yeah i feel that too on both your points- seems like everything I do these days ties into both the physical realm + the digital/nft space. and shut down my commissions too😅 - way too distracting and hindered my development of my own style for much too long!

68,"@isabellaarnao I think a value tier should be not exploiting creators. Isn’t that one of the main points of nfts and trickles into web3? Every day I’m seeing more projects exploiting creativity via “fan art,” web3 promo pages stealing content w/o credit, &amp; so much more. It all feels very web2."

72,"That same love that was scribbled on napkins and traveled miles just to be stashed under my pillow is that which broke my spirit.. the emotional abuse, trauma, and heartbreak we don’t realize were enduring until we get to the other side."
73,There was a period in which we couldn’t communicate on phones &amp; relied on writing letters back and forth for 3 months. It was beautiful but brutal. I’ll still always look back on it fondly.
74,"This is one of love &amp; loss. I once had my first “love.” I say that in quotes because it wasn’t love. It was the idea of love. Sweet, soft and sultry, riddled with innocence and lust. There were many things wrong, but at that age, no one knows better."
75,Photography was actually my initial artistic pursuit. These images were created while I lived in Melbourne in 2019 &amp; had my first experience shooting at a professional studio. I wanted to create work that told an entire story.
