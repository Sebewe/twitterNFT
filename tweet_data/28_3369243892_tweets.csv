19,WE ARE LIVE! 🎙✨ https://t.co/wlOGOr4nmH
20,@duarchieC Love to see it!
21,@Abbyiqbal01 Do we really though? The ones you have mentioned are all from teams/communities that have either changed the space or delivered!
22,@Gillynator Agreed. I love our Discord because it is so far away from that. We also have a price talk channel that everyone mutes where people can vent lmao.
23,"@bluntman_eth @RugRadio Also, not all projects need to be DAOs, but all projects *need* to have a treasury that is transparent and where the money goes back to building."
24,@cumzillaraptor @nfteasedETH @FoleyConor @saltymfer @same_mfers @same_mfer @ProtonMail @RugRadio Mfers 🤝 Rug Radio
25,"@edwardtheartist Agreed. I feel all of the growth pains with is, sometimes it hurts, but it feels good overall!!!"

28,"@thehamzajunaid In the @RugRadio we just opened an alpha channel for members to chat about projects and I myself am very active in our members chat. That does not mean I give signals, but my wallet is doxxed and anyone can track it."
29,"@NotJackDavis Correct. I will use my own project as an example: when we ran from 0.5 ETH to 1.88 ETH in a weekend, I was happy, but I was worried mostly. No founder in their right minds actually wants a mega pump, it is not healthy. Slow and steady wins the race."
30,"@chxppeth @coolcatsnft I own so many cats, but it seems the most vocal people have been people who don't own any cats. Sure, the delays suck, and I have had my worries and concerns, but I trust the team."
31,"What's funny in this space is that projects are mostly judged by their floor price, rather than by their builders and communities. I expect that to change as more people continue to get rugged over and over again and overhyped projects slowly start fading away."
32,@bluntman_eth I'll take it!
33,"Rug Radio was built for the artists, community members and builders of the space, by artists, community members and builders of the space. We not only keep growing, but we keep supporting the above, and it will never stop. Very proud of us and we will keep on delivering. https://t.co/wpiP8sPJnQ"
34,"@Jiran_z Tell us about the influencers, what celebs are they hiring. LMAO"
35,@solflowers_bot Love to see it!
36,"When @KeithGrossman called to ask me if @RugRadio would help elevate what TIME is doing to help raise funds for Ukraine, I didn’t even think about it. Glad to be hosting this today at 5:30PM ET, and hoping to see you all there. The 1/1’s are beautiful! ✨ https://t.co/wlOGOr4nmH"

43,"World of Women #5672 just sold at Christie’s Evening Sale in London for 567K GBP with hammer fee which is approximately $755K USD or 260 ETH! That’s a new ATH for a non royalty WoW, congratulations! 👏✨ https://t.co/jYOTwH9FEq"
44,"@averagejoelle The lull on digital/crypto art is momentary. Those thinking 10 years ahead will become very wealthy, it’s impossible not to see this clearly!"
45,@BoredApe1000 Maybe I need to turn Kevin into a rug and our floor will fly
46,"Heard at Christie’s sale: “This work is coming directly from the artists estate, you could not get better provenance than that.” 

I believe it, but how do you verify that in 100 years aside from hearsay? God I love the blockchain, and I’m so bullish on digital art."
47,RT @angelinocvino: Just got my @RugRadio member pass. Working in media most of my life I really liked this project. Plus @farokh is great.…
48,"Gm!

Putting my #PinkTuxForChristies on WoW #6777 to celebrate the sale and support @YKarkai and the wonderful community she built!

I go back to her often, matching eyes and lips, got that lioness hair, shes flowin’ and flyin’ no wonder she’s the 9th rarest! 👸🏾✨

53,"STOP SELLING YOUR SPACE DOODLES FOR CHEAP YOU’RE SELLING YOUR ACTUAL DOODLE WITH IT. 

I don’t own one and I know that. You own a $30,000 jpeg and aren’t even researching it. Be careful! 

You’re WRAPPING your doodle. It’s NOT a new NFT.

61,@DeezeFi @BAYC5511 @coinmaverick @SacramentoKings @sobylife Can we actually go do that together for a game plz
62,"@heartstopworks I noticed you put the price down to 0.10 ETH back in September 2021, yet you are still here. That's grit. That's putting yourself out there and never stopping. Also, your web is fire. Keep it up!"
