23,@Helloimmorgan It’s a partnership and it’s not on the main collection. It’s just for the charity auction I think
24,@NathanHeadPhoto They partnered with OpenSea for the gold edition auction.
25,@the_good_knight @0xTAY_ @coolcatsnft Not if the team has someone leading “product” in many cases CEOs are mostly visionary or involved in the highest level meetings / trying to get more funding for future projects

57,@K3n_eth Founders think that running a successful mint earns them repayment of a mil+ each… they aren’t treating it as seed money

61,@andrwwang The grind for WL also creates a fake community in many ways. Community pre and post mint will be a night and day change. How is anyone supposed to dyor if they can’t accurately understand if they fit into what will eventually become that projects community
