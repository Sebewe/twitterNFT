7,getting my bearings in @GenesisLoot slowly. i have listened to every ep of @TolarianCollege but trading for builds isn’t in my blood. more often a an observer of these cultures. learning how to participate
8,99% of kevins will go to zero
9,99% of the kevins youre collecting will be worthless in 10 years!
10,RT @divine_economy: @nnnnicholas kevins are public goods made by private scammers
11,@divine_economy luxury communism right there
12,the metaverse is the meme
13,the meme is the metaverse
14,dyor i dont own any kevins
15,"kevins are like crypto: not good or bad, but an opportunity 💫"
16,kevins are bigger than @kevinmfers
17,@nptacek just now and it fuckn blows!  https://t.co/ynD5O88TDo
18,kevins are funnier than 90% of nfts
19,kevins cinemative metaverse
20,kevins is bigger than pixelmon
21,@0xcyp you can see a world in which all anon rugpulls are effectively cc0 because liability risk &gt; copyright value
22,kevins reminds me of loot
23,is kevins effectively cc0 because shame?

28,@WilsonCusack so cute
29,@Jihoz_Axie @fiveoutofnine and @r_ross_campbell have both been toying around with ideas in this neighb lately iirc
30,"tl;dr: instead of every client hitting the ipfs then making dozens or more calls to @infura_io and @graphprotocol ($$$), one client every few minutes makes those calls and caches the results on @pinatacloud. every client in between gets cached data from pinata (fast+cheap)."
31,"to create a performant and decentr. dapp frontend w/ fresh data, visitors first fetch the most recently pinned cached data from @pinatacloud on ipfs. if the data is more than a few mins old, the client fetches new data from @graphprotocol &amp; @infura_io, then pins it anew to pinata"
32,ipfs hosted decentralized websites struggle to achieve the performance of centralized sites running on AWS/Vercel because all the cool realtime data must be fetched from @infura_io and @graphprotocol by each client each time they load the page. this is slow and $$$.
33,extremely cool new ipfs caching strategy by @PeelDAO for @juiceboxETH. https://t.co/GUaNwqkIcE
34,@peripheralist .@PeelDao pulled it off! amazing 🧃🍊🍌
35,@jakethedegen let’s go
36,@NathanCRoth yep agreed  :)
37,@WilsonCusack depends what you mean. @graphprotocol has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars to parallel core dev teams like @streamingfastio. meanwhile @juiceboxETH has many independent devs that have joined the fray as dao members and aftive contributors.
38,genesis mana fam: i have received your messages but i must complete some work before i can return to focusing on mana later this aft
39,"@ptrwtts @steveklbnf @0xProject @reservoir0x trying to understand what @reservoir0x is. is this right?
- an NFT REST api
- an NFT marketplace API
- an offchain orderbook
- an SDK for making frontends out of these pieces"
40,@GratefulApe_eth @Zom_Bae_ !
41,@ptrwtts yes!
42,"@Amin_3X zora already does this well. but it makes buyers pay gas to bid. weaker buyer UX compared to opensea. however on OS, artists pay 2.5% fee"
43,@Westlife29Nic yes i took a step back a few weeks ago. but i love juicebox!
44,@neokry_ @ArtivaApp i think @0xProject can do this for you reliably
45,lets find and elevate the people who made magic schoolbus
46,@caffeinum no offchain bidding afaik
47,"@DennisonBertram they are open source and not shared contract (unlike OS). they have a website that makes them easy to deploy, also integrated with opensea and foundation. the team has been supportive and helpful to artists deploying their own contracts for good a stretch. also free afaik"
48,"RT @dystopiabreaker: in the future will it really be a litmus test for money that it only allows you to do ""good things"" with it (where goo…"
49,@crypt0natrix @caffeinum they’re strongk
50,@crypt0natrix @caffeinum oh!
51,"@crypt0natrix @caffeinum sick makes sense. i guess it’s better if everyone is on the same site, in terms of traffic/browsing buyer network effect."
52,@caffeinum offchain bidding would be clutch for feeling on par with opensea ux
53,"@caffeinum basically just a self hosted frontend for manifold nft primary sales, fixed price or auction"
54,lol auctions
55,artists would flock to a good self hosted offchain bidding no fee auction frontend for manifold contracts
56,anyone doing pretty front ends to opensea audtions?
57,@r_ross_campbell 🔥
58,@DrGorilla_md ugh.

64,what is Lost Mana? https://t.co/VUYRMFNXUH
65,@TimshelXYZ @bitcoin4bernie @GenesisLoot are lost mana the items that could exist but are not represented in the og loot bags?
66,"@bitcoin4bernie @TimshelXYZ @GenesisLoot @damedoteth also, did @dhof mint mana yet?"
67,@saraledterman investor accreditation test should be an optional AP class
68,@JoshuaFisher oh havent had that problem!
69,"@bitcoin4bernie @TimshelXYZ @GenesisLoot couple improvements i'd like
- claim all for bag (this is prob not possible without a proxy contract)
- improved local storage so that ""minting..."" remains accurate regardless refreshing the page (this sorta works but not perfectly)
- filter by minted/unminted"
70,"@bitcoin4bernie @GenesisLoot i'm surprised. i had a lot in the same block, same way. maybe the gas limit got adjusted accidentally? scrolling through the gas limit input can change numbers (in ffox if i recall)"
71,just sold a genesis mana i didn't need for 0.21e to the nftx pool.. fun! https://t.co/ZS7bpHxhQ2 https://t.co/BU00PHDU8J
72,@bitcoin4bernie @GenesisLoot oh that's odd! with mmask?
73,"@bitcoin4bernie @GenesisLoot you can, but you have to remember which you've already queued. luckily screwing it up is only $2 per revert"
74,@bitcoin4bernie @GenesisLoot been minting for 24hrs+ lol
75,@bitcoin4bernie @GenesisLoot lets do it.. pathogen.eth :)
76,@GenesisLoot it’s free real estate
77,getting txs thru at 22 gwei is luxury. L1 is the new matic
78,"gas at 27 gwei, wyd?"
79,@KeyboardMonkey3 destroying etheria wasn’t enough for this guy 😂
80,@john_c_palmer makes it feel like a great wallet needs a great shield
81,@drewcoffman yes. i felt the need to observe that we have now broken the seal on internationally crowdfunding weapons for foreign wars. i’m afraid of how this plays out long term in the social media misinformation war theatre.
82,"@drewcoffman imagine if a fundraiser to arm russian separatists had emerged shortly thereafter, and was collecting funds via crypto. are we really ready for this technology to be used to crowdfund foreign wars? i fear many are not considering what’s around the corner."
83,juicebox’s Banny banana mascot was drawn on paper first https://t.co/pNSw8Nr8uZ
84,@bitcoin4bernie if you sold! haha
85,a high velocity frontend dev could create a twitter vs ethereum comparison site to facilitate pump and dump sleuthing. make it easy to screenshot and ride the virality into sustainable pmf social block explorer
86,@r_ross_campbell @withBackdrop hm i'm not seeing where it does that but maybe it's just slow to crawl my wallet
87,took the cheap gas opportunity last night to name a handful of the wallets i use regularly. has already made it so much easier to find those wallets on etherscan and opensea. very fun
88,web3 devs: a site where you can see a person's twitter and txs side by side. bonus points if you can select an nft collection or token and see all related tweets and txs
89,never seen etherscan like this https://t.co/BtyXGxNwTh
