15,@NFTLlama Stop caring what people thought about me and my nft plays and just held and not let fud get in the way of my conviction plays. Your gut often does wonders when you listen to it..

17,"I knew not to care about what the nft community has to say when I noticed projects with racist roots and artists still have high floor prices.

Morals come after money in this space and therefore I really don't care what anyone has to say, I do my little bit in this rat race."

35,@WickdNFT @Pixelmon I can see where you're coming from -- the general view from their perspective (all stories are two sided though...) Is that what they were shown is not what they were given
