26,@jarrodT123 @TheStarsPodcast @awo211 @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys We finished it up today but that you!  Just disappointed I spent the money on the tool to do the grunt work ya know? Grateful that part of tax prep is done
27,@jarrodT123 @TheStarsPodcast @awo211 @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys Oh no it’s more than that- it’s going though every open sea transaction and properly noting it as a mint on a csv file. Can’t even use the tools within ZenLedger
28,@WitchyBits1 @__Keegan__ @jleewalls1 I keep forgetting like a douche canoe! I’m sorry! I bought orange candles the other day though! Haha
29,@jarrodT123 @TheStarsPodcast @awo211 @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys That’s likely true. That’s not the issue- it’s the way ZenLedger is pulling the transactions in resulting in a manual review and adjustment
30,@agaramdhani Anyone else going to click that link bc I’m not!
31,@jarrodT123 @TheStarsPodcast @awo211 @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys No-  we had to do a whole thing bc all of the tokens we bought on open sea lazy mint contracts came through on ZenLedger as straight eth  to usd conversions
32,@TheStarsPodcast @awo211 @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys @jarrodT123 Also self transfers came through weird too. I’m just disappointed that for the price tag- it’s a lot of work.
33,@awo211 @TheStarsPodcast @ZenLedgerIO @nfdaddys Someone needs to bc I feel like I did a lot of the work for the money we paid.
34,How many 8949 pages did you generate? 🤦🏻‍♀️
35,@theashrcrawford Planning on it
36,@Gee2Lorie 🙌🏻
37,@doreencummings_ I deleted my tweet encouraging people to be unicorns just in case! Hahaha
38,Gm! Big stretch!! Start over as many times as you want today!
39,@doreencummings_ I just meant to be the unique being that someone needs to experience so they believe in magic!  I may need to look it up too to make sure im not promoting something crazy! Hahah

70,@Gadget_Girl_1 It was so hard!
71,@KenWhiffey Yep.  There are many of us vocal about the standards we expect from people and projects.  I get soap boxxy about it but that's because it's important even if ethics seems boring to talk about.
