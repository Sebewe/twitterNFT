1,Always lovely to see the Art Blocks newsletter... even lovelier when my Cube is the hero image 😘 https://t.co/KDJRBAm9x6
2,@bentossell @mattdesl Love the blue monochrome!
3,"@dmitricherniak @pixelpete We considered counting it as infinity, seemed most appropriate for Wrapture -- but it meant that unlaunched projects would all also float to the top."
4,@soupskyn You're welcome! Awesome avatar! 😙
5,"This is our last release before the really big one -- next up, we'll be launching the full Archipelago market. It's going to be 🔥, can't wait to show you all what a truly collector-centric NFT marketplace will feel like. 

Until then--happy browsing and happy collecting!"
6,"Speaking as a collector myself, I'm confident that exploring the market using Archipelago, and then going to OpenSea to make the purchase, is the best way to collect generative art. I used our beta branch to pick up some Chimeras and it was 🧑🏽‍🍳😘"
7,"But, building a great collection means finding grail pieces no-matter where they're listed. And OpenSea orderbook has some true gems... they can just be a bit hard to find sometimes 🤣. So we're super pleased that Archipelago can make collector's lives a bit easier."
8,"Archipelago's mission is to create the best possible experience for collecting generative art. That's why we're building a tailored marketplace with trait bidding, lower fees (just 1%), and a super smooth UX."
9,Dear @artblocks_io collectors: the @archipelago_art team has a bear market surprise for you! We've integrated @opensea pricing data for all ArtBlocks pieces into Archipelago. Check it out here: https://t.co/5Nhj92TdVk
10,@erinbeess Final touches on integrating OpenSea data into Archipelago :)

12,@aramunu Cube club! 🧊🙌🏽
13,"Thanks also to @mattdesl for making the awesome art, and @Vince_Van_Dough providing the ETH 🙂"
14,"Also, I followed in the footsteps of @ArtOnBlockchain and used @endaomentdotorg to set up a crypto-native donor advised fund. This has been a super seamless process and has made my giving way easier -- highly recommend it so far."
15,"It's the very end of the year, and I'm happy to report that I did follow through on giving away the proceeds from my Subscape. The two largest chunks went to @coralcrf who are doing amazing work restoring coral reefs, and @SavingNature who are preserving South American rainforest https://t.co/AxJCDB61T9"
16,"@balon_art @tylerxhobbs @coinbase @punk6529 First name that popped into my head is “hyperspace”

I love #9 btw, it’s perhaps my favorite denza"
17,"@andrewbadr Coral Restoration Foundation, they are doing really cool work around renewing coral reefs off the coast of Florida. @coralcrf"
18,"@OriginalGoldCat Wait no, I meant to grab that one but someone else did!
Got this one though

20,"A while ago I assembled a full ""Divine ... of Brilliance"" loot set (robes, slippers, gloves, hood). I'm looking to let go of it in the next few days for tax loss harvesting. Anyone interested in it?"
21,"Also thanks to @mikeybitcoin and @kaito_gallery for getting me back into my @useGALLERY! They've added a bunch of new features that have made organizing little sets like this a lot easier. You can see these sets (and more) here: 

https://t.co/pHcCbVbxSw"
22,"Thanks to @Unordered__list and @artblocks_io for making awesome art, and to the bear market for how affordable these pickups were 🐻😘"
23,"Finally, my favorite set: ""Two Moons""

I love how balanced the composition is, even though the mints are random!

28,"I like it as a counterpoint to Meridian 801 (Starry Summit), which has a similar mountain &amp; stars effect, but with a pristine starscape.  https://t.co/NnAmf7qamM"
29,"Decided to make a bear market pickup and collect Meridian 145. It looks like a mountain at night, although the white tear slightly jars the sky. 

https://t.co/eB2TZjtpwt"
30,"@sharadv @opensea Yup, building @archipelago_art. We've been a bit quiet on twitter lately, but action proceeds behind the scenes...expect to see a lot more in January.

(Also, explore the art! https://t.co/qsGboB5NDu)"
31,"This is a grail set of Ringers. Love how it has four different body/bg colors, and has increasing grid sizes from 3x3 all the way up to the buggy/unexpected 6x6 grid. Props to @rudyadler's legendary Ringer collection which has all 4. https://t.co/gl5TOicEcd"
32,@DeFiStaker Thanks @DeFiStaker! Right back at ya 🥰
33,@DeFiStaker You’ll need to withdraw it manually from the bid. Everything always costs gas 😬
34,"This partybid didn’t quite go thru — we got to 10/11E before the deadline. 

Disappointed that it didn’t work out, but still appreciate the learning experience. Trying new things and seeing what happens, rain or shine, is a big part of how I crypto. Thanks to everyone who joined! https://t.co/9yoQHxiYNF"
35,@plutoniumfitzg This is actually Meridian 801 😍
36,"For the first time, we’ll have an @artblocks_io auction organized by people who love and *get* generative art 😍 https://t.co/Ncz1s1X9Qx"
37,"@META_DREAMER Nah, the same problem def exists for DAOs. Just look at older DAOs where the big token holders and the current contributors are not the same.

Principal agent problems are more fundamental than the corporate structure."
38,This partybid is nearly filled! Excited to co-own a beautiful Meridian with some fellow generative art adventurers. 🖼 https://t.co/9yoQHxiYNF
39,"@kaito_gallery @gnosisSafe Hey, super glad to see you're working on this! Pinging @wchargin to see if he has any thoughts."
40,"Wanna co-own this meridian together? 💍😉
https://t.co/seRy2mVrQh"
41,"@AndyPuls @prtyDAO @mattdesl @WPeaster Once the Meridian is purchased, it will behave like all the other tokens on https://t.co/W6rPp6NKSL. I haven't actually looked into the dynamics super closely -- I like to learn new technology by diving in a little, so this is my dive into partybid / fractional."
42,"You can also read all about @prtyDAO's new launch here:
https://t.co/YMxs06cxwj"
43,"The Meridian is on sale for 11E, which I think is a pretty good deal on one of the most interesting collections on Art Blocks. If you'd like to join me in grabbing 837, you can add your ETH to the party on @prtyDAO!

https://t.co/seRy2mVrQh"
44,"I like this Meridian both for its soothing color palette, and because it looks a bit like there's a mountain under a dark sky. In that respect, it reminds me of my favorite Meridian, ""Starry Summit"". 

https://t.co/NnAmf7qamM"
45,"I'm super interested in NFT-powered social experiences, which means I'm super interested in @prtyDAO making group NFT purchases easy. 

So, I decided to give it a spin on one of my favorite projects: Meridians by @mattdesl. We're going for Meridian 837: 
https://t.co/MbcwMgYRU1"
46,"If you'd like to be a part of our earliest beta cohort, please add your email address to the beta signup list here: https://t.co/CIs4Rz3Ejr

Can't wait to have you all onboard for the launch 😘"
47,"As for timelines: the art explorer is already live. We're going to ship the OpenSea data integration concurrently with writing the marketplace backend, so you can expect that in December. We'll actually launch the marketplace in January."
48,It's with this question in mind that I share the most exciting new update: Archipelago will have a token! We want to recognize and reward the early adopters we depend on. So we'll be distributing the token liberally to early users ☺️
49,The key question for Archipelago is whether people are willing to migrate liquidity to a new marketplace. We can build it; but will you come?
50,"That said, our marketplace will support some powerful new features from day 1. Most notably, we'll have collection-wide floor bids, a super smooth experience, and reduced fees (1% rather than 2.5%)."
51,"After that, we'll be launching the actual marketplace. We're going to deploy it cautiously and progressively, as keeping your NFTs safe is a top priority. The first beta launch will not request unlimited smart contract approvals, and it will only allow trading certain new drops."
52,"Next up, we're going to integrate OpenSea marketplace data into the explorer. As a collector, knowing the floor prices and trade history is crucial to making informed decisions. Since we're building the site for collectors, we need to include all that info!"
53,"Our first step was launching the Archipelago Art Explorer. We put the art front-and-center, built in a trait explorer, and have optimized, buttery smooth performance. It's great on both mobile and desktop. Take it for a spin, and find some art you love!
https://t.co/qsGboBnov2"
54,"First, our focus: We are creating the best possible experience for discovering and collecting generative art NFTs. As collectors ourselves, we're making the marketplace that we wish already existed."
55,"gm frens!

Time for an @archipelago_art update. We've been hard at work building an amazing NFT marketplace for y'all. I'd like to share our progress thus far, as well as our future plans and timelines."
56,". @useGALLERY is spot on in their read on how NFTs will shape digital identity and culture. Can't wait to see and use the tools they build!

Also @mikeybitcoin please add @gnosisSafe  support soon, I miss using Gallery 🤣🥰 https://t.co/pcg5QbIW4W"
57,"Have been off twitter for a bit -- I've been focused on co-founding @archipelago_art and (simultaneously) falling in love with someone new.

However! I have had some tweet threads brewing and I think it's their time. Expect to see a bit more from me this week ☺️"
58,"Hot off the @archipelago_art presses: We now support showing a collector's whole collection, as here: 

https://t.co/PXvRQlVByV

More features, like filtering and searching within your collection, coming soon!"
59,"@balon_art @proper Nice pickup Balon! I was eyeing it, glad it went to a good collector."
60,"Just grabbed my first Edifice! A beautiful salt that feels very structural. Big thanks to @_blockbird for pointing it out to me!

https://t.co/L4xi0vdYNX"
61,"As expected: the Salt palette Edifices are my favorite.

https://t.co/HkcGxkpGRn https://t.co/aGpPok6K9U"
62,"The Edifice mints (by @bendotk) are all rendered now. Scrolling through them is a pleasure. 🖼

https://t.co/cR3zGsxvW2"
63,"surprisingly strong secondary volume for Edifices, even with all the AB APIs down + no images available for most of the mints. Brisk business in plain black squares. https://t.co/9UQ3SmJH3h"
64,"Woah, check out edifice #31
https://t.co/z4oUCUTMA3"
65,"Here's another Edifice that's quite striking.

https://t.co/cBOlSll5m9"
66,"I'm guessing this colors: salt setting will be a favorite palette of mine. Right now there's only one, but I look forward to seeing more show up! https://t.co/HkcGxkpGRn"
67,"Edifice had some trouble getting off the ground, but the mints are coming in now and some of them are quite beautiful.

70,@Ugly2PointO @plutoniumfitzg What filters are you looking for? We already have trait filters.
71,"Archipelago is focused on making the best possible experience for @artblocks_io collectors.

The collector’s journey starts with encountering, exploring, and falling in love with the art. 

So we’ve started with a buttery smooth art explorer.

72,"Gm NYC 

The @archipelago_art team has been hard at work, and we have a surprise for you 

It will go live tomorrow morning 🥳"
73,"@elaifresh @liminal_warmth @enkiv2 @mikerugnetta I don't know the provenance of those projects you linked from @liminal_warmth's OpenSea, but I would bet money that both Cryptopunks and Ringers have made it into MoMA by the end of the decade.

Ringers, if you haven't seen them: https://t.co/HWKyELLWMZ"
74,"@elaifresh @liminal_warmth @enkiv2 @mikerugnetta Early impressionists were *trashed* by contemporary art critics. Reviews on Impression, Sunrise by Monet include: ""Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than this seascape!"" https://t.co/O74ZxUf1IB"
75,"@liminal_warmth @waluigi_stan_1 @elaifresh @enkiv2 @mikerugnetta The same is true of the traditional art market (w diff participants). 

Whether or not you think enormous valuations on pieces by Monet are Picasso are ""reasonable"", they're definitely a stable part of our socioeconomic reality. The same will be true for significant NFT art."
76,"@liminal_warmth @waluigi_stan_1 @elaifresh @enkiv2 @mikerugnetta The fact that generative art NFT valuations are so high (e.g. the Fidenza floor is 130E) reflects the existence of a confident crypto-native noveau riche, for whom these NFTs are status flexes, declarations of taste, and also investment pieces.

https://t.co/1nPUYKiqJD"
77,"@liminal_warmth @waluigi_stan_1 @elaifresh @enkiv2 @mikerugnetta In this case, the (purely digital) nature of NFTs perfectly matches the (purely digital) nature of software-produced generative art.

Some of the results are very beautiful and surprising, as in Starry Summit:
https://t.co/g743N9AEIj"
78,"@liminal_warmth @waluigi_stan_1 @elaifresh @enkiv2 @mikerugnetta However, generative art NFTs are the best example where the NFT *is* the art. The creation of the NFT specifically corresponds to the creation of the artwork, because the transaction minting the NFT supplies the random seed to the algorithm."
79,"@liminal_warmth @waluigi_stan_1 @elaifresh @enkiv2 @mikerugnetta I'm not really the ""owner"" of MoM -- more, the owner of the crypto schelling point associated with MoM.

But, it has some real effects! There's a group that's planning to make a published version of the essay (hopefully w/ Scott's blessing) + I got added due to the NFT"

84,"We got the team together last week, and hacking together has been a lot of fun. We've made solid progress. Some of it is almost ready to get shown off... but not quite yet 😉

Stay tuned over the next 1-2 weeks. I'll have a demo to share, and an exciting announcement."
85,"It amazes me every day that my go-to person on frontend design and my go-to person on the nuances of US securities law are the same person. 

Both of his skillsets will be vital for Archipelago, since we need a kickass frontend, and operate in a murky regulatory landscape."
86,The third co-founder is @ianjdarrow. Ian is one of the most capable designers and frontend developers that I've worked with. He's ALSO a lawyer and an expert on crypto regulatory policy; literally on the board at @BlockchainAssn. What. a. unicorn. 😱🤩
87,"Ever since, he's become my go-to resource on deep Solidity questions, and for smart contract security reviews. (He was the one who spotted that bundle attack I mentioned a few weeks ago.)

Having William on the team gives me a lot of confidence in our backend execution."
88,"A few months ago, I persuaded William to leave his job at Google and learn Solidity. Many people would start with some tutorials. William's approach was to deep dive on the spec and semantics of the EVM, and then read through the full Uniswap code. This took him about 2 weeks 🙃"
89,"First, there's @wchargin. He is an incredibly tasteful and talented software engineer. We first met when he was my intern at Google; still in college, and already a much stronger dev than me! 🤩 We co-founded @sourcecred, so you could say we've got history."
90,"After the rush of the initial Archipelago sprint, I realized that shipping a great product first requires building a great team. I'm happy to say that I'm co-founding Archipelago alongside two incredibly talented individuals. Allow me to tell you about them!"
91,"Hello all! It's been a little while since the last @archipelago_art update. I'd like to give updates on the team we've assembled, on our progress thus far, and on the roadmap. Today, to start, I'll brief on the team."
92,"@erinbeess I've been using a macbook with a broken trackpad for the past several weeks bc I've been waiting for this drop... 

planning to bid 1000 GWEI on the macbook order page"
93,@no_nft @kGolid I do have a cube in the same palette :) https://t.co/0ojpBlOkKm
94,"My favorite thing about this set is how the pieces seem to flow together, united by a band of white that bounces across the triptych. Taken together, I think of them as a river flowing from the highlands of abstraction and minimalism down to the marshes of complexity and chaos. https://t.co/Vns2s9ASAw"
95,"#467 closes the trio out, exploring Archetype's turbulent and chaotic side, and showcasing the vibrancy of the Paddle palette.

I missed this when it first came to market, and when I saw it in the Christie's set I thought I'd lost it. Luckily, I wound up getting a second chance! https://t.co/NLBXWLnFBh"
96,"I discovered @artblocks_io through falling in love with this project, and #36 was one of my first favorites. To me, it evokes a fantastically futuristic cityscape, or perhaps the surface of a computer chip. It finds harmony between regularity and complexity. https://t.co/suacsPhDh1"
97,#45 shows off one side of Archetypes that I particularly love: their minimalism. It's structure and its use of the palette are both quite muted. https://t.co/U6Kd9PFchy
98,I've long wanted to make a triptych of Archetypes (@kgolid) that showcases how Archetypes range from minimal and order towards chaos and complexity. I've put together a trio in my favorite palette (Paddle) that I'd like to share. 🤗 https://t.co/qTpoIb4MhY
99,@dmitricherniak Love them
