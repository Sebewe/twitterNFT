7,"@nohbhodi @andrwwang Do you know what a low estimate is? Auction houses set in away that the end result is double the low, which would accumulate to $40-60m which is way off."
8,"@nohbhodi @andrwwang Nope, it was the low estimate was $14m, so reserve must have been less than that"
9,@andrwwang Potentially a ~$2m withdrawal fee 😳
10,@elitanjourno Might be around $2m if 75% of buyers premium of low estimate 😳

14,@Jon_Sharples Yes very good point Jon!

This is definitely one of the most asked questions in the NFT space!
