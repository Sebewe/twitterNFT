6,@doriandargan @HipCityReg @cdixon and yes that’s correct!
7,@doriandargan @cdixon ahhhhh okay that tracks!
8,@telefontelaviv 100% agree
9,@facesOfEth haha oh yes i don’t mean in a ui design way—i mean the way that people are using it to critique web2 patterns of thought in web3
10,@amrith @holyn i DO think it's a great word in specific contexts because it captures a particular pattern/mentality well... but yeah the buzzword-y quality is wearing on me hahaha
11,don’t get me wrong i support it but also i feel like i missed a memo somewhere
12,okay is there a reason everyone suddenly started using “skeuomorphic” as shade recently

i do that with some games that are not meant to be played that way but pls just give me a “no attacks rn” mode"
16,"@lindseywinder1 @hedgeyfinance i think i feel similarly to dom—financial utility is fine, but that’s most of what people are doing right now, and i’m a lot more interested in what lies beyond defi but with nfts https://t.co/xewddDyoiq"
17,"@damedoteth aw, i hope you’re feeling better soon!"
18,"pattern-matching—and pushing every nft project to follow a template—isn’t what’ll push forward nfts as a whole

progress comes from people charting their own courses to try something new"
19,"“utility” for most nfts now is a kind of collective fiction

it’s not hard to push out random perks (mint lists, erc20 airdrops, token-gated discords, and so on) that temporarily boost perceived value—real use cases take time to create, and they’ll look different for each project https://t.co/X0nUDyKoTa"

31,@divine_economy reading the cryptopians rn and every time i read more about the origins of ethereum i’m astounded that it turned out this way because a couple more of these people and we would be living in a completely different timeline rn
32,"@divine_economy ahhh, i think that’s a much more fragile situation—if your perception was clout-chasing con artist (rip), you’re probably not alone in feeling put off by that, and then (imo) only a matter of time before it blows up in some way"
33,"@divine_economy oh, yes, if you’re asking if people can go far because of these qualities, i think the answer is absolutely 

but how to define “success”"
34,@divine_economy lmao i feel like “borderline con artists” speaks for itself
35,"@heypva “at all costs” is the operative phrase, i don’t think many of the others can coexist with that long-term"
36,"the incentives of the space as they exist today are so heavily slanted toward empty hype and against slow, thoughtful, painstaking execution

if that doesn’t change, projects by conscientious people who care about craft, like interfaces, will disappear in a sea of pixelmons"
37,"all the respect to @WGMInterfaces because i can’t imagine that this decision was easy to make but i can absolutely empathize

the pressure of the latter will grind out the people doing the former if we let it"
38,"earnestly: web3 needs to figure out what the purpose of this space is

is it about experimenting with new ideas, sparking creativity, building long-term value, making cool shit, having fun? or is it about chasing quick returns at all costs https://t.co/By11hwirwn"
