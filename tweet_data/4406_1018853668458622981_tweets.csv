14,"With most major I.P on @veve_official now dropped with 5 variants and combined editions of 50k+

35,@ontherightpad @veve_official Yes  💯  I agree with the common comics especially when the others are the same but with parts greyed out 🤦
36,"@ontherightpad @veve_official I don't think the commons are more of a 1st that the others 🤔 they all get the FA label 

The batman's were different statues whereas the Spiderman's are the same with different poses 

maybe on chain data could prove the mint order but personally I don't value commons as FA"
37,@wrapAjay 💯 https://t.co/54SMERHSkc
38,"@ontherightpad @veve_official I think it depends each collector is different, personally I like FA's I don't like how Donald is labelled because the lenticular cards were his 1st appearance but the golden moment is labelled FA 🤷 

But generally I think FA &gt; FE"
39,"@Xugioul @TgCmdrVIPER Yeah I like em both, I think L&amp;T is a little more ""disney iconic"" and maybe a bit more collectable 

Also has less supply, rare and is cheaper ATM 🤔 https://t.co/q9kyDmLkPk"

I tend to agree, however I think a higher gem cashout fee helps omi - nft work better 🤔"
52,"@yuckitsandre Thanks for sharing 🙏

10% seems a little high compared to other services using similar cash out methods 

2.5% market fees should be considered against volume traded on veve this adds up to alot and is probably the bulk of their revenue 

Im interested how this effects omi-nft"

maybe a DAO play, something like veefriends or maybe the metakey for access and utility 🤷"
68,Que the : In case you missed it post 😅
69,"Let me know your thoughts and suggestions below 👇

I'm hopeful the team will improve the experience 🤞 https://t.co/Me6FBtGA5A"
70,"So in short, 

The drop raffle will help and I think gem / collectable transfers need to be stopped 🛑

I know this is a good feature that many use but overall I think its better not to have it  🤷

Some form of KYC is needed to have all cash out and marketplace features 🤝 https://t.co/Nk7dDFq6x0"
71,"How do you stop the market bots ❓

These is no good way to stop the market bots as they have a speed advantage 🤷

Perhaps limiting secondary sales to 1 item per day for non verified / non KYC accounts could help with this issue 🤞 https://t.co/FuDdeG8MQq"
72,You could offer $omi trading to KYC accounts only or restrict $omi withdrawals to verified users 🤞 https://t.co/7cd9aOdKiN
73,"What about omi - nft ❓

Without KYC omi to nft will become a method to enable bot users again 🤖

1. Generate accounts on multiple phones
2. Fund accounts with drop 💲 amount
3. Run bots and collect collectables
4. Sell collectables for 10-20x $omi gains
5. Take $omi off app https://t.co/b6qxvE4QGN"
74,"If cashing out is only via MTL and you cant transfer, coupled with the drop lottery system multiple accounts should become less of an issue and have less advantage than they currently do🤷 https://t.co/Jesdr1KHCF"
75,"How do you stop multiple fake accounts ❓

Without KYC as an initial requirement this would be difficult but, as long as drops are mobile only they are limited to the amount of devices they have 📱

you could ensure web versions are not drop enabled https://t.co/hcrGx4leDb"
76,"How do you stop bots ❓

Taking away the speed advantage is a good start and the new drop lottery will help with this 🤞

Stop gem and collectable transfers, This will stop bot users from cashing out and force them to use the MTL and KYC methods 🤝 https://t.co/AxAqfgz8E2"
77,"Even if 1 in 10 bot accounts make it through, they could have still made a profit and now they just repeat the cycle with fresh accounts 🤖

In the mean time legitimate accounts are getting falsely banned 🤦

Its more important to find ways to stop the cycle and in app exploits https://t.co/MWzW8vQo3R"
78,"Does disabling accounts work ❓

Most bot accounts are often disabled after the above cycle 👆 

By this time bot users have already sold the collectables for gems and the gems for crypto 💸 https://t.co/h9573ILfs8"
79,"Lets look at exactly how they do it❓ 

1. Generate accounts on multiple phones
2. Fund accounts with drop 💲 amount 
3. Run bots and get collectables 
4. Sell collectables for 10-20x gem gains
5. sell gems off app for crypto @ 0.5 per gem

This is how cheap gems are made 💎 https://t.co/gbZHCd8LiO"
80,"How do they get away with it ❓

Whilst #veve may stop many types of bots they are also unable to stop many bots 🛑

Most bots don't alter or affect the #veve app so I imagine they are hard to detect 🤖 https://t.co/wvDkY75dvP"
81,"There are also marketplace bots 🤖 

These will monitor and snipe collectables under a certain price point 💎

This would come in handy straight after a drop or when users make listing errors 🤦 https://t.co/4K140xKxdp"
82,"Ok, lets talk about the @veve_official bots 🤖 🧵

How do bots use #veve ❓

There are many bots programmed to auto locate the buy now button and click it as soon as possible giving them a speed advantage 

The button is often pressed before it even renders on your device 🎮 https://t.co/kt6LQQOrYn"

84,"@Xugioul Cashing out is an important feature and without a clear method the collectables will lose alot of their value, I would hope they roll it out as soon as its ready to go🤷

I feel the longer it takes the more they lose credibility and damage their reputation 🤞"
85,"@Xugioul Interesting, thanks for sharing your perspective 🙏 

I agree it will be a slow rollout, the market prices shouldn't be their concern, the market will adjust 🤷 

I think the lack of MTL is causing the high prices and enabling cheap off app gems and false pricing"

only catch is you can never sell 🤔 https://t.co/iFnyE2gQ4o"
94,"@Wolcott503 @VeveFam If they get MTL and stop the transfers this will also force kyc without making it a barrier 🤝 the only way to cash out will be through MTL which requires kyc, could solve alot of their issues 👍

Omi to nft may cause issues though 🤷
Bots - sell cheap for omi - take off app 🤔"
