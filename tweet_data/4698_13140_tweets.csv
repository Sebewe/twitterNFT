Not many brands out there that have raised $50M+ and still tweeting openly about what needs to be improved.

Eric @ Zoom and Stewart @ Slack are two other great examples of being so earnest about their companies on social media. https://t.co/9uhzAct1yv"
36,"@shandysulen @ParallelNFT money raised and valuation are very different ;)

""The platform tells TechCrunch they’ve raised $50 million at a half-billion dollar valuation from crypto VC firm Paradigm."""
37,"@ParallelNFT @shandysulen and this is why WAGMI -- bc ya'll are open and driven about improving every day. 

your drops are always an event that I get to share with friends (IRL or video chats). can't wait for PD4"
38,"@shandysulen @ParallelNFT totally agreed!

I think something that makes it possible for Parallel to get so wild here is they've raised $50+ million already (so have plenty of resources) and releasing packs every year means they reuse this interface (vs other 1-time drop projects)"
39,"WGMI team cancels project and prioritizes their emotional health and long-term goals. I was really looking forward to the art but total respect.
