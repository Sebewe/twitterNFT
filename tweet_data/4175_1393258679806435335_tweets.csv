13,@_fvox @12yrold_with_cc @takenstheorem the blacklisted sybil wallets would have gotten away with ~ 800k $ENS
14,"@12yrold_with_cc @erlalons @takenstheorem another interesting aspect with these is the registrations themselves acted as indicators to link them, they weren’t manually registered so a lot of them had similar structure like “bluetable” and “redchain” - since something more random like “5hsjvdc6j7” would be too obvious"

24,"@Helkem0 @bigdsenpai sure, ""let"" was probably the wrong word to use. i'm all for open finance, against unbridled optimism. personally i've just heard firsthand that the internal management at some of them is an absolute shitshow"
25,@knowerofmarkets but I do think it's magical that some of the most talented devs in this space are still in highschool lol
26,"@knowerofmarkets and to clarify, I have nothing against young people taking an active part in development, governance of the largest protocols. however, there is a certain kind of maturity and experience associated with 'leading' that level of risk, which I think seldom gets acknowledged."
27,"@knowerofmarkets I would hope so :) it's my ""most controversial"" crypto opinion. eager to hear your argument though"
