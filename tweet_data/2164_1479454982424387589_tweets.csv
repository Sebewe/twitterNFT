0,"I’m in the @AntonymNFT whitelist chat and it’s embarrassing. People selling for 5-10x mint and they’re getting called out as paper hands. Oddly enough, 1+ eth is more than most people make in a month. It’s a toxic culture. Taking profits IS NOT paper handing. It’s smart."
1,"i feel like i need to start a ""how markets work"" spaces. some of yall just have no idea, huh?"
2,"8. i do all of this stuff, WITH A TEAM, and still sometimes we get bamboozled. that's showbiz, baby. you don't get outsized returns with no risk. it's impossible. just make sure you aren't risking ETH that you need. because nothing is guaranteed profit."
3,7. i'm lucky enough to have an entire community at @weareilliquid to do most of the DD for me. consider joining a reputable group and working with the community. doesn't have to be us. it can be anyone. although @EtherOrcs and @CyberKongz are top class as well.
4,"6. on mint day watch how fast the project actually mints. if you have WL, congrats, you have a free call option with no risk. you can simply wait and see. i don't mint until i've seen significant volume. usually &gt;30-40%."
5,"5. how active is the discord compared to the number of members? 80k members but only 10 messages in 10 minutes? all bots. ~1/3 of all members should be ""online"" at any given time."
6,"4. what communities are backing this project? whitelist spots usually go to known, respected communities that tend to hold (shout out @weareilliquid). there should be some overlap (kongz, orcs, mice, etc). no? be careful."
7,3. is a rapper or athlete involved? do they know about blockchain tech? no? exit immediately.
8,2. look at the roadmap. does it make any sense at all? do you think the people running the project are actually capable of executing. be realistic. if they're a bunch of chads do you really think they know how to make a game in unreal? i'm a chad so it's ok for me to say it.
9,"1. if anyone of the team ever says anything about the floor price, it's already ngmi"
10,Catdads best practices for figuring out if a project is trash: a series.
11,@henrycoo0 this is how i've made money. if you do your research the risk is asymmetric.
12,TOON MOON LFG. or is someone about to fud it in like 30 seconds?
13,@henrycoo0 it's the same as investing into any startup. you HAVE to do your due diligence or you're going to get crushed. people have been completely blinded by greed and have stopped thinking critically.
14,@henrycoo0 who cares if they're asking for a big mint price? you're the one who gets to decide whether you want to pay it. there's no moral obligation to charge any less than you think the market will bear.
15,@Nate_Rivers @wizardofsoho @etheroman @vahrez273 welcome to the wonderful world of investing in startups. seem to good to be true? don't give them your money. it's your own fault if you do. no one elses. ever.
16,"maybe i'm just numb from years behind a desk on wall street arguing with people. i don't even care if something is a scam. if they get me, gg. but i do my best to research and avoid projects that seem too good to be true. the real issue is the greed is making most of you stupid."
17,@jumpmanft derivatives are never the move. even if you make money it feel dirty.
18,"if you're not willing to put in the work you're going to end up losing your money. maybe fast, maybe slow. mayne you'll make some here or there. but eventually it'll all be gone."
19,i've been a professional trader for almost two decades. want my advice? don't listen to anyone. do your own research. think for yourself. something look off? don't buy. who cares? there's a million mints a week. don't fomo. don't worry about it.
20,@NFTLlama bro you need a snickers or something. it's gonna be ok.
21,so all of you following along at home. just because some clown you follow says X project is good or bad doesn't mean shit. chances are they have a vested interest and reason to be saying that. they're not thinking of you. they don't care about you. it's about the money. always.
22,at this point the mint day fud is just another whale/influencer market manipulation tactic. maybe they didn't get in. maybe they didn't get paid. idk. i don't care. it's just as bad as any other manipulation tactic. you're playing yourselves.
23,"squiggles got nailed and they still make $8MM. It was a best case scenario for them, assuming it was a scam. Cereal Club minted out, just at a lower price, so they're not missing any meals either. the only thing that happened was the FUD killed the secondary market."
24,"let's take a stroll down memory lane and see who exactly got rekt from all of these mint day callouts:

the buyers. 

not the founders. the founders will ALWAYS make money even if they don't mint out. when you take a project down on mint day you only hurt the people who believed."
25,"@wizardofsoho @GrantlandOG @Nate_Rivers @etheroman @vahrez273 it's not nonsense, it's a hit job."
26,"every one of these bullshit influencers ""protecting the community"" are talking their own book and pumping their own bags. no one cares about you or is trying to preserve your bankroll. you have to do it yourself."
27,"this is the kind of clown show our space has turned into. an influencooooooor has decided a founder, who is doxxed himself, is not worthy of launching a project. get the fuck out of here, you tool. https://t.co/P3dk1qEHCJ"
28,"@JustAshleyNFTs leave my bags alone, lady."
29,"i have a couple mints today, i guess. crypto influencooooooors and arbitoooooooors of truth should be fudding them into the ground any minute now. this space is turning into absolute trash because everyone loves drama and never does their own research."
30,we love the $jpeg
31,All of this calling projects out on mint day needs to stop. If you’ve been that skeptical then say something early. Feels more and more like hit jobs and sour grapes.
32,@ohhshiny https://t.co/Bu0FIlF3W4
33,@JustAshleyNFTs No one with an educated palate has ever said such a thing. 🤷🏻‍♂️
34,@JustAshleyNFTs everyone knows mint chocolate chip is the goat.
35,"@DatBoiFromGer @RTFKTLukson Better than Feb 30th, amirite?"
36,"RT @RTFKTLukson: Like and RT for a whitelist.
Winners will be announced 29feb.

🥸"
37,@NateAlexNFT Lol these articles are all trash. source: my 15 years running a commodity desk.
38,i am a clone-x maxi https://t.co/h361m43Xhl
39,@DaBunnyOFFICIAL whoa whoa whoa.
40,@NFTLlama tbh people never understand that a couple million isn't enough to ruin a reputation over. you'll end up making 10-100x that if you execute properly.
41,"@ohhshiny teach me how to influence, bro."
42,covid has me tired as fuck. i think i've gotten 22hrs of sleep in the last 48 and i'm still dead. REKT.
43,@Nhan_ETH Is it really a paper hand if you made 8+ eth tho?
44,@JustAshleyNFTs Was it because of my tweet yesterday?
45,"amazing to me that people keep falling for these discord hack scams. you know when a project, especially a hyped one, is going to mint. don’t let greed make you stupid. stay woke."
46,@SneakyninjaNFTs We love to see it @SneakyninjaNFTs
47,but why does euphoria have so many dicks all the time?
48,tbh pixelmon could not be more goated. epic scam. i’m not even mad.
49,finally got my #ETHDenver airdrop. positive for COVID. RIP. can the devs do something pls?
50,@LFGEVERYDAY_ Lol. Manual labor and I have never gotten along well.
51,@The_Habibiz Don’t you tell me what to do
52,All you nerds doing 1E to 10E challenge and that’s great. But I’ve done 10E to 1E so many times that it’s not even a challenge anymore. There’s levels to this shit.
53,Yeah sex is great but have you ever had the Uber eats driver show up right as you were checking how far away they were?
54,"@jumpmanft pitch me, i got eth to spend."
55,been a windows guy all my life. but after having my macbook for a couple of weeks i can honestly say it's the best computer i've ever owned. except excel. excel for mac is garboooooo.
56,"idk what kind of plague i had after #ETHDenver but it's gone now, thankfully. and no, it wasn't covid. I'M BACK."
57,"Absolutely NFA DYOR

News from a crypto desk: buy flows have been very strong all day. Expectations are that they will continue unless another shoe drops in Ukraine. Stay woke."
58,@golfer319 @themetroverse Big $MET guy. I’m pretty heavy into this.
59,@Llamaverse_ is going to be 🔥 because @NFTLlama is 🔥.
60,Why markets up? They’re forward looking. The western scansions are toothless. They weren’t going to do anything super crazy in this economic environment because otherwise oil would fly to 200 bbl. Cutting SWIFT got pulled off the table and nothing happened to Putin directly. Gg.
61,"@jumpmanft this is why you can't watch the charts all day. gigantic volume came in after they did zero to SWIFT, oil and putin himself. we back bb."
62,rip everyone who stabled the lows.
63,everyone's an expert trader until the selling starts. OmG sO mUcH rEd. devs do something!
64,Latte art isn’t quite dialed in but the cup is dope. https://t.co/XEPP7SDzoL
65,"@DeezeFi fud me, daddy"
66,cmv: shutting off SWIFT in russia is super bullish for crypto.
67,now we see that the talking heads and influencers have absolutely no idea how markets work or what to do if they actually slide a little. it's comedy.
68,we've now shifted from twitter macro to twitter vix trading. i love it.
69,Lol everyone on Twitter is now a macro expert. Amazing how they were all detectives just 2 weeks ago.
70,"Bigly red day. Might be a good idea to step away for a bit. Nothing good comes from staring at screens while the world is on fire. Stay safe, everyone."
71,Spot on https://t.co/6ixjjeAqpT
72,@ohhshiny Any project where the focus is the floor price is doomed from the start.
73,👀 https://t.co/23VEg27tgo 👀 @bonkalytics
74,"@insuredao adding 30k to their liquidity pool after raising like 4.5mm is embarrassing. if you're starting a protocol and don't understand liquidity, tokenomics or anything related to markets, reach out to me. i'm happy to advise. i don't even want money. just make it stop."
75,@cr0ssETH lol imagine thinking you shouldn't take profits.
76,"amazing the one mint i didn't have was the one that wasn't fudded directly into the ground. sometimes it be like that, i guess."
77,"mama i made it. someone is impersonating me on discord. i will never ask anyone for money, ever. i will never ask my own personal details ever. i'm good, i promise. https://t.co/jvmWy3NkA0"
78,@jumpmanft they'll reload because people LOVE fudding and drama
79,LLAMA LLAMA LLAMA @NFTLlama https://t.co/YkcDgtrh23
80,"once he's out of twitter jail, should @wizardofsoho and i start a morning spaces? we'll probably provide zero insight and just bitch and moan about our dust. but it might be fun."
81,"@wizardofsoho just got rekt for 12hrs by twitter. rest in pepperoni, king."
82,@NftRamo i will tell you what to buy: an alfa pass. :D
83,@DeezeFi Dude you’re an animal. We love to see it.
84,I think I’m still on mountain time. This getting up at 6am is dumbbbb.
85,Moon pls https://t.co/80ccsXrdMl
86,@0xInuarashi wen moon????
87,Had a really good chat with @jumpmanft this afternoon. No wonder our two communities are at the top of the game.
88,clown show https://t.co/QvUjYUHlze
89,no way this isn't 100% legit. https://t.co/8huW38P624
90,@wizardofsoho So you’re saving I really don’t have to wear a shirt and shoes inside of the gas station? The sign is a lie?
91,"@NftRamo money never sleeps, bro"
92,@golfer319 @themetroverse @nftworldsNFT Also in on these. Boolish.
93,@NFTLlama SKEM. lol what a moron.
94,RT @wizardofsoho: If you are going to NFT LA ... I would suggest grabbing an ALFA PASS 🤷🏽‍♂️ 😉 Dont fade me on this one.
95,if there's anything i learned from #ethdenver it's that we need to throw an absolute rager at #nftla....probably nothing.
96,i need @cerealclubnft to take me to valhalla today at reveal. pls pump my bags.
97,@JustAshleyNFTs absolutely nothing
98,@wizardofsoho @EtherOrcs amazing to me that rugs pull in several million in an afternoon while the orcs have basically only made enough to cover their internal costs.
99,gm gm gm gm gm. not hungover. feels amazing. lfg.
