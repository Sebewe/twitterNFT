3,@leoyoung0 guess we'll find out in this bear market
4,@GradyTeske sounds about right https://t.co/jcyzZtwDpE
5,@hughisme399 i agree! how do you think DAO recruiting will look different from traditional recruiting?
6,what do you think are some of the biggest challenges that DAOs will face in the next year?
7,@KabirKabby talk to **web3 friends
8,"@KabirKabby hey there! it’s overwhelming for me too! 

important thing is to just have conviction in your skills and what you’re doing. you may not know as much as everyone else but you’re here and that’s what matters. 

also: talk to friends, they’ll understand!"
9,"@crypt__jo lol thiisss is why i dislike most of the “women only” pfp projects lmao 

that and the art is trash"
10,@crypt__jo this is too sweet 🥺🥺 and hell yes that’s exactly what it’s intended for! a chill server where we all just talk and vibe 🥰
11,ethereum? gas fees? zk rollups? on chain? multisig wallets? what are you talking about babe you’ve been in a coma for the past 10 years. now get up katy perry just released her latest single
12,@SHL0MS @web3isgreat protect @SHL0MS at all costs!!!!!

14,"honestly, yeah https://t.co/zG01lc1j9F"
15,@Lelldesigns you got this ❤️❤️
16,@jaiyagill ty! i hope that more people understand that it’s ok to be confused and hop around in terms of what you’re exploring and what you wanna do. i think my career trajectory is probably confusing to most but it’s the journey that matters
17,@Brad08414464 oh i’ve had multiple early life crises at this point 😵‍💫 it’s very chaotic but i think it helps me not to pigeonhole myself into something and close off cool opportunities!
18,@sadlyoddisfying most people say this and what they really mean is just “learning” lol
19,@ramanradhika01 not an easy shift to make—you got this 💪
20,@jame__z super thankful to have met you too! we’ll kill it together 🥳
21,@SatoshiSarah you get some unreal negging and harassment on here fr i’m so sorry
22,@theramblingboy i’m excited 🤞
23,@petergyang thank you peter! permission granted! @odyssey_dao is great ❤️🥺
24,"16/ if you’re here for the first time, hi, i’m sarah, and i share tidbits about my web3 journey on twitter 👋

feel free to follow for more!"
25,"15/ TL;DR

👉🏻 your experiences have value 
👉🏻 find your own narrative 
👉🏻 carve out your own space 
👉🏻 everyone’s journey is different 
👉🏻 have a beginner’s mind

once you realize these, it’s easy to find opportunities in web3 🤩"
26,"14/ i’m now working on content for web3 companies/DAOs and harnessing my talent for storytelling as a non-technical user

on the side, i’m also documenting my learnings on twitter—

and sharing journeys like this with you all ✨"
27,"14/ although i had no prior knowledge, i was eager to learn

i approached every web3 concept as if i were a toddler and wasn’t ashamed to ask silly questions 

and during this, i met other learners to have thoughtful convos with @reegannotraygan @TheMan489_ @badtyro @jame__z"
28,"13/ to me web3 was the perfect culmination of what i was interested in: 

👉🏻 governance 
👉🏻 creator economy 
👉🏻 digital communities 
👉🏻 unorthodoxy 

and it helped that i could talk and create narratives about these things at length, even though i’m not a dev!"
29,"12/ but with DAOs and bounties and part-time work and new projects so prevalent in the space, i realized that i could carve out my own back door just by pursuing non-traditional opportunities

i started building a brand on twitter and sharing my experiences"
30,"11/ the beginning of my web3 journey was difficult. i thought that my first step was to secure a web3 job.

i didn’t have ANY technical experience or prior experience at a tech company/VC 

i was getting ghosted left and right"
31,"10/ in january of 2021 i quit my job 

in the time after, i created a twitter account to explore web3, and i immediately fell down the rabbithole"
32,"9/ i realized i didn’t dislike the company, i just hated the idea that we were always operating in service to giant platforms. 

i stumbled upon @ljin18’s articles in my search for US investors…

…and started thinking about the creator economy in a different way"
33,"8/ but working at a chinese social media startup had given me the following: 

1) the ability to work under immense time pressure ⏰
2) an understanding the creator economy in the world’s largest market 💹
3) adaptability to uncertain conditions❓"
34,"7/ but two raises and two promotions later, i felt burnt out

the direction wasn’t working and i had to accept that maybe i had chosen the wrong career path, *again* 

(keep in mind, i had just spent 4 years chasing law school for…nothing) 📉"
35,"6/ i spent hours incubating creators we had literally recruited from random group chats from 0 to 55k+ followers on tiktok

we presented entire social media strategies to large companies expanding westwards

&amp; i was given more responsibility than i ever dreamed of"
36,"5/ as the only american on the team: 

i was responsible for onboarding and managing ALL of our foreign social media influencers, + helping them produce in-house content 

it also allowed me to execute things the rest of the team couldn’t"
37,"4/ i decided to make a quick career switch ➡️ and started working at a chinese social media/e-commerce startup desperate for foreign hires

(my first experience in private industry)"
38,"3/ but COVID had really altered my sense of things. pursuing law didn’t feel right anymore ☹️

the world was ending and i felt like i was headed towards monotony

panic set in: WTF did i want to do with my life?"
39,"2/ the pandemic started during the middle of my senior year

after graduating, my plan was to study for the LSAT and go to law school after a year back home (in china)."
40,"1/ i started out as a pretty idealistic freshman majoring in poli sci @columbia

my goal was to get into yale and become the first asian-american supreme court justice…

…so i spent 4 years basically grinding to get the perfect GPA for law school."
41,"i spent 4 years of college doing unpaid government/nonprofit internships and took only one STEM class 

here’s how i ended up going full-time in web3👇🧵"
42,@web3wu super down!!
43,starting CS50 to finally get over my fear of programming lol
44,@ATManfredi exactly bestie
45,@Defimystic thank you kind anon!! 🥰🥰 i’m glad you’re enjoying it
46,"one thing that i’ll never do in web3, and call me out if i do end up doing this, is act like i know more than anyone else 

the market is big enough for everyone"
47,"@jarrenmims @layer3xyz 😉 you can check out our beta @ https://t.co/ADUXyf6V6F or join the discord

48,@thechutneyrebel @layer3xyz gm❣️
49,"@jarrenmims everyone has something to offer, even without experience. 

my rec is to claim bounties and do work for DAOs to get paid for your experience

know your worth! &lt;3"
50,@Lelldesigns the relief
51,@0a0505 we’re all sigma grinding on twitter anon
52,@0xCadena gm
53,@badtyro AYOOOO 😳
54,@Darylloh2 @layer3xyz LFG!
55,"@WNTRjon @cult_leader_en i’ve done numerous unpaid internships. it’s never about shaming someone for doing the internship, it’s about urging companies to do better and actually compensate interns for their labor"
56,my first blog post for @layer3xyz ✨ https://t.co/2AHrtlHbAn
57,"@WNTRjon @cult_leader_en that’s cool, you should still pay your interns. none of that justifies doing free labor without compensation"
58,@HawkwardArt @CryptoJobsList precisely

60,@aliciakatz employed… but still depressed 😎
61,"solidarity to the people of ukraine, fuck the warmongers and hawks who profit from the endless churn of the militarist machine."
62,@_stevenshoe @layer3xyz DM'd :)
63,@cult_leader_en if they’re making millions doing degen shit and getting millions from VC funding then they should be able to pay their fucking interns 🙄🙄
64,don’t take an unpaid internship at a crypto company https://t.co/f68VKQoXOF
65,there’s a war in ukraine can the devs do something
66,"@0xShah @petergyang thank you! your responses were super insightful + helpful!

i wanted to ask this question but didn't get the chance, do you think it's possible for someone entirely non-technical and without previous PM experience to eventually transition into a web3 PM role?"
67,@0xbad1dead @petergyang @0xShah lol did you listen to the spaces at all or just tweet some random babble
68,"incredible twitter spaces happening rn, ty @petergyang and @0xShah for validating what i'm thinking in my transition to web3
https://t.co/BN1eMwx4vC"
69,@cult_leader_en as a chronically ill person the potential to work remotely was a HUGE factor for why i chose to go into web3. so yes we need to have this convo!!!!!
70,@cult_leader_en web3 is just 99% shitposters at this point
71,@layer3xyz this is the way
72,"my friends: “how did you get into web3?”

me: i was unemployed and depressed and spent 12h/day on twitter"
73,@themlpx @indexcoop oh true! yeah i’m curious about that as well. maybe it’s a regulatory thing as it always seems to be with CEXs lol
74,@suji_yan @kunoag no idea he’s into web3 now!! 😳
75,@themlpx i think this is what @indexcoop is trying to do right?
76,@Gabe_Green @jonahpeake whispereasy
77,"dudes be crying throwing up trying to find alpha in the discord, why don’t you get OFF-lpha your phone and find a gf"
78,@SinoCrypto uwu indeed
79,@mattysino i hear they started covid
80,RT @gregisenberg: 95% of web3 is BS but 5% is beautiful
81,"@petergyang i actually thought about this from a UI/UX point of view, chinese UI/UX remains pretty crowded (think didi, taobao) in terms of what you see on the screen, western UI/UX is way more minimalistic

thinking about all my expat friends who complained about the bullet texts lol"
82,"in 2010, Xu Yi created bilibili (B站), a chinese streaming app to watch anime and chat with his friends

in 2021, bilibili IPO’d at a valuation of $2.6+ billion, now known as china’s “Gen Z Youtube”

moral of the story? build things to watch anime and chat with your friends"
83,@raihan_ what do you think is a better word for describing something that rewards builders?
84,"@_stevenshoe i’ve been compiling a reading list, and i’m also gonna be creating a learning repository for @layer3xyz! let me know if you want in :) https://t.co/t4Fytsu3oA"
85,@jackchong_jc i mean this is likely but god i really hope the suits don’t come and destroy it lol.
86,@ibansadowski discord and twitter the two genders
87,@FlameHorizon1 i was just about to say!!!!
88,crypto men please come collect yourselves https://t.co/WnIDS9B4Xc
89,"@szzomu @naval gm! i'll definitely check him out. imagine my shock when i was trying to figure out what (3,3) was and then i started having horror flashes of the grid they brought up in every international politics class LOL"
90,crypto twitter is like the trashy reality show that keeps on giving. 2 days ago we had the opensea exploit and today we found out who hacked the DAO in 2016
91,@thomaslaker @JonathanHillis @rainbowdotme @SyndicateDAO @BanklessHQ @layer3xyz @zapper_fi @rabbithole_gg @gitcoin @AxieInfinity happy to present real use cases but you’re asking not to have this conversation in good faith if that’s the approach.
92,@thomaslaker @JonathanHillis @rainbowdotme @SyndicateDAO @BanklessHQ @layer3xyz @zapper_fi @rabbithole_gg @gitcoin @AxieInfinity you spent about four minutes looking through the various twitters of interesting web3 projects i pointed out and decided that they weren’t innovative based on what i imagine to be maybe 20 seconds of reading each.
93,@thomaslaker @JonathanHillis @rainbowdotme @SyndicateDAO @BanklessHQ @layer3xyz @zapper_fi @rabbithole_gg @gitcoin @AxieInfinity then…why did you ask? lol
94,"me studying game theory in college: this sucks
me in web3: oh shit"
95,"@thomaslaker @JonathanHillis @rainbowdotme wallet app
@SyndicateDAO investment DAO
@BanklessHQ DeFi DAO
@layer3xyz future of work/gig economy

@rabbithole_gg learn to earn 
@gitcoin public grants
@AxieInfinity play to earn

DYOR though!"
96,@charlie_cao @punk6529 @FedPapers10 it absolutely is for reasons of health and safety though… china’s population is 1.4 billion and any spread of omicron could lead to senseless deaths. if you’ve ever experienced the population density of even a small chinese city the strategy is obvious
97,"@punk6529 if hospitals are overwhelmed and more people die, there is no one to blame but the chinese govt. the strategy is popular at home. few ppl actually complain of this unless you’re an expat/businessman used to having lots of global mobility"
98,"@punk6529 on a regular day, some of the biggest hospitals in beijing have up to 3 hour waiting times just to get an appointment. imagine that with unfettered covid"
99,"@punk6529 china’s hospital and healthcare system would absolutely be overwhelmed if they did not pursue zero-covid strategies 

some of the smallest cities have 4 million+ people 

ppl go to the hospital regularly for colds, minor sicknesses 

it’s an issue of capacity/pop. density"
