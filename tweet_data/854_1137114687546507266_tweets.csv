37,"RT @DiscoverXnft: 100x gains are cool, but have you ever explained NFTs to an IRL friend and it clicked on the first try?"
38,That lil #X2Y2 pump def felt like some market manipulation. Just randomly a ton of people decided to buy 10-20 eth worth of a token that has had a paused air drop for that long??? Or they are just full degen idk fam
39,@AshDrake7 Idk I just got lucky I guess lol
40,@sygmod Lmfao I remember this same thing happened with $ens
41,@AshDrake7 On one wallet yes
42,@sygmod Was spam refreshing and the second it loaded I claimed in like 30 seconds lmao. Website prolly went down right after 😂😂
43,"@sygmod Lmao yes, not on my second wallet thoo :/"
44,"@cantstopfomo @the_x2y2 Brooo it was loading for like maybe 2 or 3 minutes for me. Down again, currently trying to claim on my second wallet haha"
45,Welp thanks for the free $2k @the_x2y2 &lt;3
46,@MrSnowy10 Lmao yes dumping fast
47,"@DyungNgo @themetroverse Lol only downside man, we are behind by a few seconds compared to everyone else haha. But hey better to stay safe"
48,Lmao I have never hit my ledger buttons so fast in my life #X2Y2
49,@the_x2y2 Looool
50,Lmao @the_x2y2 site not even letting me connect wallet rn. GGs
51,"If you bought on this candle, you are really living on the edge lmao. https://t.co/nnNTVTAK4b"
52,@AshDrake7 @the_x2y2 Think my allocation is still like $2k so lets see if i can manage to get like $700 out before it drops loool
53,@AshDrake7 @the_x2y2 Frrr
54,"@AshDrake7 @the_x2y2 Lmao got uniswap open, contract copied. I'm ready 😈"
55,@CrookzzzNFT @the_x2y2 The airdrop for @the_x2y2 gets un-paused
56,@AshDrake7 @the_x2y2 Lol I think im just gonna insta sell. Dont know much about the platform so free $ ill take it.
57,"@uvchokshi27 @MTango31 @the_x2y2 Yeah, based on your OS volume. The airdrop has been paused for hours though so most likely price will dump hard when they resume the airdrop."
58,Who is ready to watch this @the_x2y2 airdrop madness in 30 minutes 😂😂
59,@zenaurelius @3seater too long ):
60,I really just want @3seater is that too much to ask
61,Pro tip: do not play CSGO with a MAYC or BAYC pfp. You will get made fun of every single game 😂
62,@cliffBallin UR SO CLOSE TO 100 OMG
63,Also. I don't wanna come across rude cause I know some people understand NFTs and just haven't had success in it yet and are trying. But to completely undermine the fact that most freelancers are getting screwed when it comes to being compensated for their creative work is a lie. https://t.co/ZStG60VMRR
64,@hozinator2210 fr man its like a mob lol
65,Its like people are happy getting screwed over by these labels and companies that don't pay enough for creative work but people have just gotten used to it. https://t.co/ZStG60VMRR
66,Anytime I post anything about success in the NFT space and artists being able to get out of the freelance grind on IG I just get bashed by a ton of people who don't understand NFTs. Shit is really starting to bug me.
67,@th1nkcrypto @TheSquabHQ 😂😂

86,@dblasphemy 👊
87,Gm! Today is the start of me trying to fix my routine. Got some good sleep last night and exercised this morning. ✨
88,@joehuber0881 @the_x2y2 Lol i just tagged the platform that is doing an airdrop. Its paused rn i think though
89,@joehuber0881 @the_x2y2 Dyor before claiming. Most say its safe
90,@joehuber0881 @the_x2y2
91,@kokokaka85553 Rn @the_x2y2 has an air drop. pretty sure the contract has been proven safe but DYOR first
92,Gn 💤😴
93,These airdrops just feel wrong lmao. People claiming free $1 - $3k once a month. Crypto is weird 🤪
94,RT @fvckrender: People freaking out on $LOOKS makes me realize how short term people think.
95,"@sergeposters @MackDnft Maybe its a glitch or something, says all 10 are owned sooo idk.."
96,@CrookzzzNFT Yeah I need to get better at that. Notice myself getting really comftarable working at home so I take advantage of that and reward myself whenever I want. Gotta get out of that habit !
97,@WK_17_ I am an avid user but it just makes me more lazy tbh 😂 Love taking some tokes at night to help me sleep though and relax
98,@FrostySnipez Okay! Thank you. I have def heard that it can mess up your appetite.
99,"@th1nkcrypto Omg I have no idea.  A while 😂 A big inspiration of mine is @yvgal's collection ""Dreamers"" I wanna do something like that probably. Like a very small ammount maybe 20-50 max at a .1 auction start. Not sure yet though."
