And service providers compete in an open market, which will further drive the innovation and UX. Only this will drive the next 1billion adoption of web3."
94,"3/
To provide both ownership and user experience, a token-centric framework like @TokenScript is a must-have. With services integrated on the user side via tokens, each user will have his/her fully integrated web, which can provide him/her 100 x better UX than web2."
