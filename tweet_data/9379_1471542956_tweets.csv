4,"for instance, we did not eat in the cafeteria. it was simply too small. instead we were free to eat anywhere in the building or go off campus if we could drive/had rides. all the kids who cared about grades met in one particular spot and we all did everything together basically."
5,"yeah i think a major saving grace for me was that my high school had about ~4,000 kids in it. it was bigger than my university. it functioned like a small town. you knew people in your small group of friends/associates, but never even interacted w other groups of kids https://t.co/70KMvhDWce"

21,"@jcenters Oh yeah wasn't accusing you at all, just riffing on the subject matter!"
22,"...but what a strange and sudden transformation. millennial joke culture developed in the context of huge destabilizing events, and in some sense is a way of putting emotional distance between oneself and those events. but i guess this is the limit of that whole mien."
