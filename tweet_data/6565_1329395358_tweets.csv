2,"@moses23__ @opensea @BoredApeYC Yup, I've seen it. But those attacks originated from people approving malicious signatures."
3,@moses23__ @opensea @BoredApeYC bruh here comes the Metamask support replies
4,"@moses23__ @opensea @BoredApeYC So did you sign any message with your Metamask? If so, you initiated the transaction. It's impossible for the transaction to get signed by itself, if there was a vulnerability this big, millions would be stolen already."
5,my buddy texted me saying Bottom is in . It’s his first week in crypto and i believe him. Why? Beginners luck 🍀

16,"@Mantaroth @NFApes @BoredApeYC Thanks. I don't blame the whole community, just one person. @NFApes is acting like a child and I don't really want to waste my energy on him. This is the first time I had to prove that I exist to a random person on Twitter."
17,"@NFApes @AshleyDCan @BAYC636 @Mantaroth @JoseColchao Can you please stop being such a pain? I don't know how did I offend you, but please just go outside and look at grass or sum"
18,@AshleyDCan @NFApes @BAYC636 @Mantaroth @JoseColchao Thanks. I really appreciate people like you.
19,@NFApes Many thanks to @BAYC636 @AshleyDCan @Mantaroth @JoseColchao who came in and wrote me. Goodbye.
20,@NFApes Appreciate everyone who sent me their thoughts about the community. I guess I won't be interacting with BAYC via twitter again.
21,"@NFApes And when I got back to the computer, I just received this message from him and a block. Wow, amazing community. Thanks for the tip, I will definitely talk about this @boredapeyc"
22,"People like @NFApes disgust me. Apparently me reaching out to many bayc members to ask questions about an article I am writing is suspicious. He starts harassing me and saying I am fake, then asks for my LinkedIn. I promise to send it to him, but I got caught up with work. https://t.co/4jo0tbdQ4K"
