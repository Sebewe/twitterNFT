Need to back urself as manager to not be anywhere near relegation at the end of the season

Also div7's will have higher resale"
97,"@NaturalStRacing @Footium_Game Nah bit more nuanced so ur academy produces a set amount of players per season. U get to choose which players to sign, the unsigned go into a free agent pool for other teams to sign. 

Migrating to layer2 so shouldnt be any gas, hoping the team can update on zooks twitch"
98,"@NaturalStRacing @Footium_Game The academy produces a new set of players each season so u dnt have to wait long for potential upgrades.
