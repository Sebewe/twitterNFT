48,@DigitalMedici agreed 😤 just posted an update. fingers crossed :)
49,@DisruptivNation @lolitataub hi! would love to put you in touch with our law firm :)
50,https://t.co/dNinriPaEm
51,"want to put together an extensive faq for anyone new. I've tried to address some comments in the replies already. Not feeling so great post-denver (iykyk), but it feels great to connect over our excitement."
52,"(no matter how hyped). Team has held off on marketing so far for good reason and irregardless of how excited I am, it's best for them to be prepared. Have reached out &amp; will follow up with any updates. I've also received some great questions &amp;"
53,"Hi everyone. Going to close DMs for tonight so I can get through all of the messages. At this point, I'd love to just drop the link but waiting for the team's go ahead..until then wanted to assure you all I don't believe in jumping through hoops to be a part of a project https://t.co/xjmj5PhDwZ https://t.co/LYIE6kjzhS"
54,@Paranoidbeauty2 Absolutely not!!! I hate those
55,@GamesMasterFlex @vutiaru I am mere mod/community manager/still up in the air bc I’ve been involved for a good period of time but quote unquote I’m overqualified lmao
56,"@yukawtf me toooooo, you’re not alone 😷😭"
57,@D_Twitt3r advice from the team as to whether they want me to do anything else beyond responding to DMs at this time
58,"@D_Twitt3r tbh thinking about it. In some of my previous replies, I expressed trying to avoid superficial growth by focusing on community building (principles the team values) until the team releases their own marketing. I'm enjoying getting to know people personally but will seek out"
59,@GilbertBillbert I can and do want to do is connect with those who have expressed interest and build the community until the team is ready to release their own marketing. :)
60,"@GilbertBillbert I agree! Ironic considering it's my tweet that's prompted this reaction but I'm hoping to find an intermediary between transparency &amp; attracting the right kind of attention (*hat nod to the importance of inclusivity*). Ultimately, it's up to the team's timing, less so mine. What"
61,"@sleepyPanda2324 @veve that's awesome, good for them! still sounds like working within the industry to me though. exciting to see what they'll do with it! the team has something different in mind. will DM :)"
62,@vutiaru my end though! Team is doing stuff bts.
63,@vutiaru transparency but I really can't imagine them purposefully bringing people down. The other thing re: sharing info on twitter from my end is trying to avoid artificial growth. We want to be inclusive but also careful to ensure the longevity of the project. This is only from
64,"@vutiaru Ooo, yes 100%!!  transparency is important!! Imo the team has communicated what I find to be justifiable excuses in holding back some information at this point in time, i.e. they still have strong ties to the industry &amp; have to be careful. It's a balance of trust &amp;"
65,@vutiaru The two co-founders of crunchyroll are fully doxxed. We have an amazing illustrator + bringing another amazing illustrator on from the industry too. Maybe it’s not the particular dream team a lot of people are imagining but it is a very solid foundation from what I can tell
66,"@eddyreyes111 there’s a lot of hype around big names which can lead to superficial growth, something we want to avoid. Would love to hear any of your ideas &amp; learn! My DMs are flooded so I kind of regret the tactic too lol, hoping to get through all of them today &amp; tomorrow"
67,"@icodeblockchain we’ll welcome them when they’re ready. It’s a long-term project, here to stay. :) lol I’ve personally gone through the challenges of trying to introduce people to the space. You do what you can 🤷‍♀️"
68,"@Daddy_afffff that would be awesome!! but not what we’re doing. I can’t imagine the industry allowing that to happen for at least the next few years. So we’re taking a different approach (at least for now. Who knows with the team’s vision and connections what can be made possible? Really, idk)"
69,@robertnessler skepticism is always the best approach ❤️ but that’s not what we’re trying to do here lol
70,@DCbuild3r @ivydengdesigns IVY 😍😍🥰
71,@caraV3RSE we’re defaulting to word of mouth advertising at this point in time but when I get the go ahead I will ❤️ will also be answering DMs soon!

77,@chillest_chill I was trying to be stealth 🥷
78,(DMs open. Inquire for more)
79,I’d never just jump into any project. Legal professionals by nature are risk-averse 😂 I’ve done thorough rounds of due diligence including getting to know these amazing people on the team. I’m thrilled for this opportunity… ❤️ you guys have no idea what’s coming. But as a hint:
80,major alpha why hasn’t this blown up in the 5 minutes that I posted it 😵‍💫
81,weeb follow weeb ...?
82,CrunchyRoll. Disney. Warner Bros. Dragon Ball Super. My Hero Academia. Full Metal Alchemist. Samurai Champloo. More. What if I told you there's a stealth nft project led by the veterans behind those names? &amp; what if I told you they wanted to turn the anime industry upside down?

89,@dtseto but apparently some clients really do 👀
90,@dabaojianghy of modifying the terms in the URL where the metadata points to.
91,@dabaojianghy I think the practical considerations behind doing so include giving more incentive for the artist to uphold their promises and more trust to the buyer. Another comment under this thread mentioned that links in the metadata are probably more preferable since they offer the benefit
92,@mikedemarais Um may I introduce you to @CryptoBirdsNFT
