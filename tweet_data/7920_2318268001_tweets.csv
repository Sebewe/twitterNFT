0,I've been trying to get a @doodles for weeks and was finally able to pull the trigger on one. Bandana/Toque Crew 🤯 ...welcome to my vault https://t.co/HtXujXGIM0

2,"@NFTSasha @cr0ssETH @doodles how adult of you, i don't agree with you so instead of just not replying you are ""muting"" me."
3,@danielgothits Not a bad idea @RugRadio could host it
4,@0xNuna @NFTCryptoChicks 😂 NFT Twitter-Tinder
5,"@NFTSasha @cr0ssETH @doodles I never said you have to have noti's on just this... everyone is an adult and if you hold a 10E+ NFT and decided to not understand what was happening before selling, then be that adult and not blame the project"
6,@themos_themos @Deadfellaz clean
7,@notDeerowz Well played
8,"@NFTSasha @cr0ssETH @doodles lol so always someone else fault hmm?! Love you want it both ways. Claim they didn’t warn people then claim they did but people mute notifications?! Also btw how about a final warning right on twitter prior to launch?! 👇
https://t.co/2kOrj6zV8D"
9,@NateAlexNFT Also I love the “how could they have known” answers. Mmm maybe from the 100’s of times it was stated and announced?!
10,@NFTSasha @cr0ssETH @doodles No way to know?! Who the heck buys or owns an NFT for 13E and doesn’t read or listen for the past 1-2 months then saying it will wrap and unwrap and be 1 NFT
11,@SirRhett @wsavas While pixelmon builds that bag off royalties
12,@DolliesNFT @SirRhett @wsavas Can’t wait for it
13,@KOBESYSTEM143 @nbatopshot Mighty Gojiras - because I would lose ETH to actually sell them
14,@holderofbags https://t.co/3KitnQcVHQ
15,@MarkNFT Agree you have to be smart enough to flip that mint for something that a good long term hold
16,I am most bearish on a project DM'ing me to help promote them
17,@JodieCrook @LazyLionsNFT @NFTCryptoChicks Always https://t.co/vM7Es6ueyX

64,"Something I think is undervalued is #ChainFacesArena by @NateAlexNFT - there is only around 3,500 of 27k that have a scars. So keep dropping them to the floor and I'll keep buying more. https://t.co/9AgO1eAA3k"

You are a real one! You help push a community you are in and support DHC, while you don't shit post. You keep it real and that is the best anyone can do! You do you! https://t.co/zQRCzyx3J8"
71,"@JB__nfts @BoredApeYC @psychedelic_nft @Pixelmon @hypebearsclub No way, keep Kevin and Diaper Bears! A risk no one should take"
72,So I wanted a @doodles but they keep hanging a bit out of my price range. So do I snag and @InvsbleFriends as a consolation prize?
73,@Ay_Zimmy @JohnDCrypto Nice work the account doesn't exist anymore!
74,@JWeb777 @BoredApeYC Did Kev just get goated?!
75,@BAYC7585 In a pfp situation yes
76,Pixelmon will have multiple generations. Is this a threat? https://t.co/r8bm4MhIkV
77,"I actually really like the art of @InvsbleFriends and they revealed pretty fast after mint, seemed smooth. But I just can't come to drop 7E on one. Anyone else feel different want to convince me? 👇"
78,@DiscoverXnft Selling 13 on mint day was the move
79,@SweetBeanDazz 1 of 3
80,@hunterorrell @NateAlexNFT Facts
81,RT @farokh: The fact that @CryptoMories got delisted on OpenSea over a lie by some gritting artist is a shame and sets a very bad precedent…

94,@NateAlexNFT It’s funny but not since I would prefer to hold this
95,@NateAlexNFT wen mint?
96,@thecodinggal That 70mil is no laughing matter. Sucked liquidity right out for a cash grab. Oh sorry I mean 63m as 7m is being spent to further the project 🤔🤣
97,"You know anyone that joined NFT’s 48 hours ago is thinking “So I buy and 2 days later it increases 50%, seems simple”"
