9,@KJJKETH @EnsBidsBot @Visa Yea it’s obviously a private account. It would much bigger news for this space if it were really them. It’s important that we inform the parent company so they have a chance to respond.
10,@DegenBobs @BloomCapital_ Uf! Nice 👍

30,@jgonzales19701 @_musks Great name mlb.eth. Very valuable
31,"@cerecrypto Using traditional web2 analysis, Esthetics gets high volume 368K searches per month and high cost per click for ads. You can assume a 2% conversion rate add an x yearly multiplier. The .com name is worth $60-80K. You can assume .eth is a fraction of this."
32,"The commercial value of a domain name is easy to calculate based on volume of searches, cost per click for ads, and conversion rate 

But in Web3 there seems to be another factor which is: engagement (and how cool that ID name is 😎)
