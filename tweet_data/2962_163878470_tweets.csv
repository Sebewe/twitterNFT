0,@MrJamesonNeat I dug thru some here too (a couple were on Amazon): https://t.co/WhSOpmKNQd @TokenframeNFT looks dope but the ones I liked are on back order… Google VexFrame too…
1,@MrJamesonNeat Just posted this / got some good recs in general hall on sat night - but I think they’re all mentioned here already. I didn’t pull the trigger on anything yet though…
2,@Degentraland @doodles I haven’t wrapped yet. Don’t judge. But I’ve mentally prepared myself for 1s across the clan. Set the bar low. #lifehack

4,@jpegrich @strangersxyz …so discord invites for all of us doods stalking this? 😆 But seriously gl and excited to learn more!
5,@DimeBagger On the sidelines as well… actually worried a “common” ship could devalue what’s currently a pretty rare face - not my forever dood so I’ll see how this plays out before jumping in (flying away?) 🐥
6,@Degentraland Glad I shifted into usdc at $2400 🧠😑

11,@chriscantino Fun one. Think it depends on your stage of life as well… Hands down B. The risk/reward and time unlock of 10% (versus the constant pressure / commitment of 100%) is 🤌 (said as dad w/ two young kids)
