76,@owlman1of1 @monkeybetdao @invariantlabs_ 2/ there are few projects with actual utility out there and not everyone that’s here now (projects and collectors) will be here for the long term. I think the mb project is awesome and it’s crazy to see how much has been built in such a short amount of time.
77,@owlman1of1 1/ Hey @owlman1of1 just wanted today that I’ve been a strong believer in you and @monkeybetdao and @invariantlabs_ from day 1. I love your vision and what you’ve delivered already. I suspect there’s a lot more mb hodlers like me out there.

81,"8) The gauntlet has been thrown down.

The OS IPO has focused the community on this issue and we are ready for the new entrant to throw their hat into the ring.

Game on sers."
82,"7) The capital opportunity is immense.

In November OS reached $10B in all-time volume, just 3 months after hitting $1B.

The numbers are already silly and NFTs aren’t going anywhere.

The largest opportunities tend to draw out the brightest and the most ambitious."
83,"6) The status quo simply isn’t that good.

There is a ton of low hanging fruit for delivering a better NFT marketplace experience.

Filtering, discoverability, community curation, social integration to name a few.

It won’t take much to be much better."
84,"5) As a community we are hopelessly open to new ideas and new technology.

We are working things out together, we will debate and follow each other into new paradigms willingly and sometimes unknowingly.

It drives the volatility in our markets and the creativity in our projects."
85,"4) Principles matter to us.

A platform that builds itself on crypto foundations - trustless, permissionless, transparent, immutable and decentralised - will capture the heart of the NFT community.

The next OS won’t just be ours, it will be one that we’re proud of."
86,"3) Liquidity will follow opportunity.

This new model is too powerful.
The incentives are so strong that a truly great decentralised alternative will represent an unmissable opportunity for the community to share in the upside of the markets that we fuel."
87,"2) We have been to the mountaintop and we have seen the promised land.

@Uniswap, @dydxprotocol, @SuperRare, @ensdomains.

Participation -&gt; Community -&gt; Ownership -&gt; Evangelism -&gt; Belonging

This is the new model, it is now well understood and increasingly expected."
88,"1) Today’s IPO has made building a decentralised, DAO-governed NFT marketplace the mother of all market opportunities.

It’s so enormous that it almost guarantees that an @opensea killer will win out.

Forget OS, let’s talk about the next OS.
