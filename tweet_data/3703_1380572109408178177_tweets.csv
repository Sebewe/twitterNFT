27,"@HammerToe @RealNoaty Nothing to learn from you here. I am not the first and will not be the last person claiming that XRP uses blockchain technology, but it’s not a blockchain. Peace out ✌🏻"
28,@HammerToe @RealNoaty We”ll see in the future if that’s truly decentralized and permissionless as you’r saying
29,@Saifp123 @RealNoaty LMAO
30,"@HammerToe @RealNoaty Ok, I feel you"
31,"@HammerToe @RealNoaty A “decentralized and permissionless blockchain” is something like bitcoin where the network is secured by cryptograpy, and nodes have been started w/o a third party. Cannot be shut down as highly distributed. Not exactly the case for XRP ledger. I respect your thoughts. That’s it"
32,@HammerToe @RealNoaty The point is that XRP is a wannabe decentralized blockchain but it’s actually not for the points mentioned above.
33,"@HammerToe @RealNoaty Sorry, you can say whatever, but that’s highly inaccurate. Ripple has reframed several times how XRP fits into its biz model. And what about Ripple’s OnDemand liquidity? Doesn’t require XRP neither? C’mon bro…just leave that!"
34,@HammerToe @RealNoaty Saying that XRP is permissionless it’s inaccurate and potentially misleading. And you know that as well as you know that Ripple Net is inherent when discussing about XRP. That’s why XRP is not a successful blockchain. Because it claims to be something it’s actually not.
35,@HammerToe @RealNoaty Fair enough now?
36,"@HammerToe @RealNoaty XRP ledger is permissionless and you are right, Ripple has no control over it. However, Ripple net where XRP solutions are, it’s permissioned network. Ripple uses blockchain technology, but it’s not a blockchain."
37,"@HammerToe @RealNoaty @HammerToe The company Ripple has full access to XRP nodes. It uses a trusted network of validators where it can decide the way these validators are decided and who they are. So you have decentralization of the nodes, but it’s still controlled by the central Ripple entity. Fair?"
38,"@RealNoaty The thing is that $XRP is not truly decentralized and there are already successful centralized L1 chains such as SOL and AVAX. So difficult for xrp to win that strong competition. It got its time in 2017, but it’s not going anywhere imo. The real winner is $XLM"
