1,"@KickPosters Hell yeah! Was watching them for a bit and finally pulled the trigger on a pair.

Now, you are going to make 1/1 pairs for each holder, right? ;)"

3,"@itsdanataylor Grab the baldie , join the RBP crew. Best group in the doodleverse"
4,"Bonus notes-
- I like using WL as a way to learn about projects. Sure beats getting excited for something and losing a gas war 
- I mostly will hold art. Only a handful of PFPs get me excited to hodl
- I won’t grind chats but happy to enter raffles/hold other NFTs/FCFS forms"
5,"@robmos_ I get quite a few from holding other NFTs.. I find the ones that pay off and keep those discords up top and try to check them frequently

Doodles alpha is the most quantity, but lots of junk too."
6,"@offnfts some strong alpha discords and multiple monitors is pretty much it. Almost all of these are being there quickly or winning raffles 

0 grinding in discords. I say hello and will pop in occasionally but I am not much of a chatter even in the ones I frequent"
7,"3/3

Overall, my judgement was fairly good. 

Of the non-minted but bullish projects, most were still interesting to me but had no momentum. 

I should have listed to myself better and sold what I wasn't bullish on pre-mint. Holding 3 of those which isn't great"
8,"2/3

For each mint, I marked ""bullishness"" on a 5-pt scale (1=Avoid, 5=Bullish)

Of the 58 WLs 
- 21 (36%) were a 4 or 5
- 6 I did not end up minting, 15 I did mint
- All 6 of the ""happy to hold"" projects were a 4+
- Only 5 minted projects were a 2, 0 projects minted at 1 (Avoid)"
9,"I have been tracking my WLs over the past 5 weeks. Some quick stats:

- 58 total Whitelists
- 26 of those that I minted
- 13 of them I still own
- 6 of them I am happy about still owning

13,"WOW - this is a hell of a NFT merch drop.

Thank you @XXHeartYou https://t.co/o4EXt7ff33"
14,"When I see people selling one IF to grab another and “only” spending a little more, all I can think is that they cost themselves like 3 ETH in ST cap gains and probably have no idea"
15,"Thank you @nudoru ! Was surprised this weekend to see this beautiful ""Grove"" show up in my wallet

Incredible work, as always https://t.co/TfAP0rWzUV"
16,@muratpak Huge collection of outstanding artists. Can’t wait to learn more
17,"@cozywyatt Wonderpals (the one of these I own). But seriously they have the art design and appeal to potentially make it as a brand. The others are a bit more niche 

All of these a great young projects."
18,"@Eye_of_Nazar @doodles @evankeast @burnttoast @poopie @itsdanataylor @garyvee Another Freddie dood, I see"

plenty available on secondary at affordable prices around mint and royalties are also going to good causes"

If you interacted with the OS migrate contract, perhaps an alternative to revoking is to quickly spin up a new wallet and send anything valuable there to hold
