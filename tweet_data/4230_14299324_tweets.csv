3,"If the team is listening, just ban the toxicity on Discord and get on to building. You can let dissenting voices in later when they're not an existential threat."
4,"Crazy what's happening over at @diatomdao. The project is getting tanked by trolls and short-term thinkers who want to micro-mange the team instead of letting them build.

I'm not sure how they attracted this many non-believers to the early community.

22,"@HuntingBenjamin There are scams everywhere, not just crypto. Nothing about what I posted was scammy. I’m not asking for money. I have a passion and I’m looking for like minded people.

I have great answers to your questions for people who are open to nuance and complexity. I wish you well."
23,"@HuntingBenjamin I gave you an answer, but you had obviously made up your mind already. Surprisingly, immediate and unwarranted hostility isn’t a great way to get to the truth.

If someone reading this thread is actually curious about the details and has an open mind, please reach out to discuss."
24,"@HuntingBenjamin Dang, you got me. Way to sniff out the bullshit!"
25,"@HuntingBenjamin That’s partly what we’re starting to org to figure out. But crypto tokens and DAOs provide tools and frameworks for communities to organize with each other without intermediaries that have an agenda. Less money spent on bureaucracy and management, more into journalists pockets."
26,"@HuntingBenjamin You make more money and get more attention if you spin things to the extreme. No money for local journalists to make a living. We should be paying people based on the quality of their work, not how well it plays into the rage algorithms."

51,@colincrook @KateKayeReports @turoczy @republicdao Do I detect sarcasm? Love to hear about others tackling the problem. Not pretending to be the first or only. Happy to find like-minded peeps.
52,@0xamand All those things that people want begin with owning data. Maybe you mean no one wants to “manage their data”? I’d agree with that. Thankfully software is good at automating.
53,@nat_sharpe_ I would argue that “choosing” is just a narrative we apply after the fact. Things just happen and then we tell ourselves that we made a decision based on various observed factors.
54,"RT @republicdao: Would you donate a $1 or more if we did a @gitcoin grant?

Any advice from people who have done one?"
55,"@turoczy @republicdao Thanks! It's short on functionality at the moment since I'm the only dev. Big things coming, including desktop app and developer API/SDK. If you want to join the DAO discord, I'll send you an invite."
