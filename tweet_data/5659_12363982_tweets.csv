1,The best part about issue 3 of @huxleysaga being released so soon is getting to read it today! The series is really f'ing good.
2,Didn't even have enough time to warn people this time.  Minted out in 20 minutes.  I got 55.  Huxley picking up steam... https://t.co/fSJAzvqFDG
3,@eric_seufert Must get Clear as well. This is an airport line length services puzzle.  I can usually get through SFO in less than 5 minutes.
4,@thenftattorney Sounds similar to free to play video game monetization to me.  The “discovery” issue is going to become really important as the market gets more crowded.
5,"Just because something is old and scarce does not make it valuable. ""Historic"" NFT collectors should take note.  Had a good collectables chat with my friend @defianceworks this week at ETHDenver."
6,@thenftattorney @nftworldsNFT Fine.  @Worldwide_WEB3 and @TheTreeverse (also treeverse dropping some teasers). I picked up an apartment last night and hold some treeverse plots.
7,.@NateAlexNFT and I left our stuff in @chelkburger’s car even though we just met. Of course I knew it was safe because she is a member of the Kongzmunity.  @CyberKongz !ooh. Everything retrieved. https://t.co/l1XClMscE1
8,Seems like the @nftworldsNFT boom is driving a metaverse land narrative. Other projects pumping with lower entry points.  You know what they are.

22,Why is LinkedIn sending me messages about what Super Bowl ads people like?  Stay in your lane resume website.
23,Is @coinbase going to win best Super Bowl ad? Probably. Mix of old school nostalgia and intrigue.
24,Were you fast enough?  I was going to mint more honestly but was making lunch for my kids.  Picked up a robot avatar this morning as well. https://t.co/yjDByHRYTf
25,"If you want a @huxleysaga comic #2 at mint price, your time is very short.  Full disclosure: I minted 100."
26,@eric_seufert going to put it all in gold I expect... :)

31,@thenftattorney Pancetta is the real alpha
32,Super Bowl feels very much like a sell the news moment for NFTs. This along with an increasing ETH price seems like we'll see a pullback. Waiting to see what happens before making any big moves.

38,"Whatever the @TheTreeverse timeless nft floor is at right now,  it is too low.  I should probably buy more."
39,This tracks to the price behavior of sealed collectable trading cards. Logically the price will track to the expected value of opening (EV) rather than the floor price. In actuality sealed pack price exceeds expected value over the long run because of lottery value. https://t.co/m4ez9Bb1SR

53,@WannaBeeple looks like you just lost an ETH.
54,@chriscantino An idea on how you plan to make money would be nice though.
55,@allenwhudson That did not play out as expected
56,How many game studios are working on Play to Earn gaming right now? All of them.
57,"@jackie_p00 @larsiusprime Read an interesting article that suggested this, but that only fixes the whole prime real estate is empty issue.  Still think discovery will be broken if you have to walk/run to where you want to be."
58,@Loopifyyy @ReadyPlayerRich Looking forward to it ser
59,@larsiusprime Ownership concentration is a big issue. Don't believe artificial land scarcity is right answer for the metaverse.  Prefer a Roblox type model that lowers barrier to entry for creators. Sandbox has a land ownership issue and will soon have a discovery issue for quality content.
60,The Sandbox isn't even available to the public except behind a paywall gated alpha.  Why would it have any users?  Lots of better metrics to gauge its current value than monthly active users (MAU). https://t.co/Dfcy5jqkE3
61,@Bored_Babes ThoughtleaderDAO coming soon.
62,@hunterorrell No way it’s the bottom.  Not feeling max pain yet.  Either that or I am dead inside.

64,@avian_gerald @fvckrender Welcome!  Been all around and this is the best coast to be.
65,Wait a second.  My profile picture was already an NFT.  What did I just pay Twitter for?  Oh well.  $3 / Month for a hexagon.

79,@ForNft Tell me about it.  Got rekt on the pixel vault drop having multiple sets in the same wallet.  Could have got so many more ape tokens.
80,It’s nice to see transactions like this since it anchors what “reasonable” nft values should be.  I moved into NFTs from the collectibles market and many of the buyers are the same. https://t.co/TEF8n4cyqS
