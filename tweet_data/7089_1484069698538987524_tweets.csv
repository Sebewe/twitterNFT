1,Is there any updated data on how many wallets hold NFTs currently?
2,"For anyone that doesn't have it yet, amazing utility incoming https://t.co/roLS5ysI9S"
3,@MoonOverlord Shit
4,"in our space. Prayers to all of you in Ukraine, lets hope these dark times go away quickly"
5,"How can some of you be so fcking dumb? I'm seeing tweets like ""swept the floor from weak hands"". People are literally scared for their lives and are taking liquidity out you are not anything special for getting bluechip at 20% discount now get lost we dont need people like this"
6,RT @cryptopom1: I can't believe I'm seeing people bragging about floor-sweeping due to people having to sell their NFTs to pay for evacuati…
7,Whos gonna get it :D https://t.co/PWgZNxHygX
8,How can people joke about end od bull market when war is literally around the corner? 🤦
9,@86Ozaru Check @InternetMadeNFT for inspo :D
10,Imagine what will happen when the nft market matures and evolve. You will buy a rare piece of your favorite brand and the next thing you see is a QR code on the packaging allowing you to use the item in metaverse ;) SICK things comming you are still early
11,RT @_candle_maker_: If you’re a lurker on CT you better start saying some shit and talking to ppl in discords. 90% of the alpha and the bes…
12,Yo @CirrusNFT how do you go about learning trait prices? It sucks that you cant sort listings by traits on open sea to see what it is selling at currently.
13,@DiscoverXnft Man i have no idea how u come up with so many tweets lmao
14,"RT @chefcraig721: Gm Twitter fam!

15,Need a dev for a specific tool tied to the OpenSea. If you are interested send me DM. #NFTCommunity #nfts
16,Bro merch is not utility its another way for u to get money. 90% of projects 1 week after mint merch merch merch. Sell merch when u built some utility already
17,Its not until you do a bit of research on MAYC traits that u realize how sick the art actually is. 🤯
18,"If you are able to create nft project with REAL utility, you have very good chances of success as right now the value projects provide is sooo low…most of them at least"
19,@ArtyNxtDoor I mean they can literally just send to the wallet?
20,"We are in a stage of euphoria and it's okay to capitalize on that, I am doing it as well but please don't believe people who are saying it will never stop"
21,I cant wait to see the evolution of NFT space in the next 10 years but if you think it will be the same as it is now you are delusional.
22,"Most of you are in the project/community cus money is tied to it and that's okay, but when the hype will slow down and the project won't deliver results your money will disappear along with your community"
23,"Let's be real for the moment. All of you talking about how your project will never die, how the community is stronger than market sentiment blah blah blah please stop."
24,Is anyone outside crypto even using Twitter for real lol?
25,@opensea @LooksRareNFT Who will create an option to watch listings/sales categorized by a trait?
26,"@Degentraland @BoredApeYC I do not agree with you. So apple should start charging 10X for iPhone just cus they are so big now? For a startup company to get 15mil (10k x 0.5ETH) from minting jpg without real meaning is absurd.

If they are so confident they can ramp up the number of mints to 20k"
27,Whats going on here? https://t.co/iGkCNlWuDx
28,NFT collection that has good volume even when market looks like shit. GO!👇#nfts #NFTcollections
29,I still believe $LOOKS will win in the long run. Nothing is built overnight
30,@Sparrowinger you to fren
31,Gm frens
32,And also its time for all these fake people and companies to leave the space anyway :)
33,"How will you use this is up to you but in my opinion, this is the greatest opportunity for building wealth you will ever get. Millionaires are built-in crises, you just have to do your research and invest when it's the hardest. 6
#nfts #MetaverseNFT #metaverse #cryptocurrency"
34,"Just like after every big crisis till now, new industry leaders will start appearing when regulations will be added to the space, the googles and amazons of metaverse will rise from ashes and the building will begin. 5"
35,"In 2022 I think we will get p2e/metaverse blow-off top and finally, the bubble will pop. If and when it happens 90% of NFTs will go to zero along with cryptocurrencies. The big crisis will hit and the road will be made for the giants to enter the space. 4"
36,"They were able to raise it only because of the perfect timing, with NFT hype and crypto bull run all eyes were, and still are on the blockchain.

So what do i think will happen? 3"
37,"Now don't get me wrong, I am 100% believer that metaverse will be part of our everyday lives in the future but we can't just expect it to happen in 2 years.
The valuations some of these companies are getting and the money they have raised is just absurd. 2"
38,"My take on metaverse, p2e gaming and current NFT situation 

I think things are going way too fast right now for that to be sustainable over a longer period of time aka. 10 years. 1"
39,"I actually wonder who is fake in NFTs space, i guess we will see when first big bear market hits"
40,@NFTSund Ye i am honestly just buyin what i think its super cool not even worrying about future price
41,Wen photography 1 of 1 NFTs blow up? I found some crazy good ones for sooo cheap its crazy...
42,RT @DiscoverXnft: What happens to Minecraft-based P2E games when Minecraft enters Web3… you know it’s coming
43,"I was literally watching @TastyBonesNFT today when the floor was 1.3ETH and wanted to buy but then my pizza delivery came so I didn't buy any cus i forgot when i came back LMAO
Lesson: Nothing I'm just dumb"
44,@FinerLawrence Some @0xApes_NFT maybe? :D
45,@chrisdevlin7700 Happy birthday fren!
46,@nftgulu gm fren
47,@CirrusNFT @AxistixNFT
48,P.s in addition to that i think probably half of these adresses dont own NFTs yet so the number is even lower for this space #nfts #nft #NFTCommunity
49,"Do you guys realise how low that is? If we take in consideration that alot of people have multiple adresses, there is literally around 3-3.5m people that have $300 in their wallet(guess)
Thats 0.04% of world population! You are still early 🚀 https://t.co/gztkwxpPvN"
50,"This is literally the best thing you could do if you are new to trading nfts! When you get more experience and capital to risk you can jump from project to project to have more opportunities but at the start follow this @CirrusNFT guide and ygmi
Perfectly written bro 👏 https://t.co/iSG6njc8DH"
51,Was wondering what do you guys think will happen in 2022/2023
52,Gm
53,"Damn tried to pick up blender for the past few days and i got overwhelmed instantly lmao(no past 3d experience)

Any blender user have advice on how to start learning it efficiently?"
54,"RT @ohhshiny: When there were no project roadmaps, using one provided vision. When IP was owned by the founders, giving the commercial righ…"
55,Can you do that anon?
56,"If you are not into flipping and want to find the  next BAYC you will have to do your own research and bet on projects that are at the beginning of their story and not the ones with 5ETH floor
Then you will also be capable of holding them at the low floor for months maybe years"
57,"People will literally be asking whats the next big thing but even if someone knew and told them, they wouldn't buy cus the project has 1000 followers at the time."
58,Project owners - If you have not sold out that doesn't mean you can cut 70% of your roadmap away. Have some respect for holders that invested hundreds or even thousands in you.
59,I have no idea what to buy today...Shill your favorite project 👇🚀
60,@Cobblerja This is more lean towards the statement that everyone is shilling their projects and think theirs is the one that will stay when i reality most of them wont. Seen it happen in crypto bear market with projects and will happen the same with NFTs
61,If I had 1ETH for each project that people say is in 3% that won't go to zero long term....
62,"Just a quick reminder if you own mfers, take some profit, please. You never know what will happen and it CAN go to 0 real quick :)"
63,Take me back to the time when i could mint something for 0.08ETH
64,Gm say it back
65,"Some people really are detached from reality…Project goes down 20% after mint and you immediately start spreading FUD and telling everyone how the project is a scam? Chill, if you want to make 10x in a day (or lose everything) go gamble in casino"
66,RT @ILikeNFTs: Save me from my enemies. Only 8000 ETH. Plz https://t.co/rg4m6CPbHA
67,"Lowest auction price will be 8.88eth? Yep NFT space is officially fucked, take me back to when there were no greedy scammers among us"
68,RT @BalouBAYC: But guys it’s only 8.88 eth https://t.co/jpm0c3T1Zu
69,@XX71040444 Ye kind of sad
70,Projects be getting $10mil after the mint and the best thing in their roadmap is 2ETH donation
71,gm frens
72,It's crucial to admit your mistakes. If you did a bad trade don't blame it on someone else but rather take a step back and analyze what you did wrong and what you will do better next time. This is the only way to improve!
73,Excuse me? @dt_chain https://t.co/hWs1wyUa2x

80,"I don’t understand gamers that hate on NFTs. 
People (me included) have hundreds if not thousands invested in game assets like skins which they cant sell
NFTs are literally the best thing that can happen to gamers. Imagine you will be able to sell your rare league skin for 1k?"

88,RT @wenmilk_eth: be very selective with your eth this month
89,"Maybe i need to start calculating my spendings in ETH

I spent 0.02ETH today for dinner sounds way better than, i spent $80"
90,Squiggles not even available on open sea anymore lmao what happend?
91,If you are listening to NFTs advice on Instagram your not gonna make it
92,@Duino_eth Good hodl and u will be one in nedt few years :)
