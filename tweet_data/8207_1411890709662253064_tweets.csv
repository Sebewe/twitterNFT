4,what do they have on you @SHAQ? 🤔😅
5,"@StaniKulechov @She__Fi @StaniKulechov it seems that frontend is acting up, its not picking up USDC balance, I double checked everything, that I'm on polygon main net etc. 

It keeps doing this - Insufficient wallet balance: 0.00 @0xChristina slots denominated in matic work fine"
6,"@StaniKulechov Hey @StaniKulechov I was trying to buy your other slot, I think something is acting up with USDC, frontend is not reading the balance

But I could use some alpha :)"

9,"@sanneh_si @nicksdjohnson @doctorow @sanneh_si but it does exactly what you want. If you look at Tally then all you see is delegates with tons of voting power, karma allows for other contributors to gain visibility. You can see who is active on forum and other types of activity."
10,"@cory_eth @nicksdjohnson @doctorow @showkarma_xyz @showkarma_xyz maybe its worth adding a disclaimer explaining that this is how index is intended to work and that it has its limitations, so that everyone within any community would keep that in mind, when they are making decisions based on that index"
11,"@cory_eth @nicksdjohnson @doctorow @showkarma_xyz Then when everyone looks at this number, they will know what it means, and they will also know that there are limitations to that number, as in that it should not taken as 100% and the only truth, but rather as one of the indicators."
12,"@cory_eth @nicksdjohnson @doctorow I think @showkarma_xyz is doing the right thing by letting communities decide on exact formula. This is how community sees the situation, and community will know how to correctly interpret that index, given that any DAO will have certain specifics."
13,"@cory_eth @nicksdjohnson @doctorow Just to be fair here, and speaking as someone who literary built tons of various indices. I would like to point out that any index is only as good as you work it. And “composite” number which aggregates something numerically is biased to an extent."
