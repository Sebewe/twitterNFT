Here's how my profile looks 👀 https://t.co/Fawa7JhQ3I"
52,"Discovery of these activities and people form the basis for interactions that's to come in the next version. 

There's a lot of value locked away in these communities, which the asynchronous communication on Discord find it difficult to unlock."
53,"Even though providing Alpha is not the primary objective, these trending NFT activities from top collectors give a good sense of what's hot among the OGs.

And then you get to see who are some of the top collectors in these communities, it's ridiculous how hard it is find people!"
