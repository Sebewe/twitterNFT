1,"Do you have an Apple Watch?

What are the best reasons to get one?"
2,"If a goal of $ape is to reward diamond hands and OG holders, gotta think there will be special utility for:

- BAYC + matching MAYC
- BAYC + any BAKC"

4,Frustrated on behalf of @goodguybiker who was being totally talked over in the Spaces by people unwilling to engage constructively.
5,Going full paranoid and installing a local copy of Revoke-cash via the GitHub repo.
6,"Be extra vigilant right now.

Scammers thrive on panic, so be sure you know exactly what you are signing before you blindly interact with new contracts to ""de-list"" or ""revoke"""

21,@CirrusNFT Clean!
22,@_miketriumph_ @MutantShopkeep I’m here for these clarifications 👊🏽. Even greater supply shortage!
23,"@MutantShopkeep Good point. 20k mutants also potentially vying against 10k OG apes for 10k dogs.

I think in closely reading a past announcement it implies special value is probably unlocked via BAYC+BAKC, and not MAYC, but who knows."
24,"Super bullish on BAKC.

If there’s *any* added utility to having an Ape + Dog set, literally every BAYC will push to acquire a dog.

Given the 1:1 supply constraint, few will break their own set to sell.

Should create an extremely attractive seller’s market.
