19,"@FuriousKj @emcorinne She’s so good at words, dude! Like, I have to google words weekly when we’re casually talking. 😅😭😂"
20,"@nkohari That’s why I always preferred a 30-45 min coding session over zoom rather than take homes. It’s more important to me that you’re collaborative, listen, and can teach. Also helps as a secondary filter for applicants that aren’t qualified or can’t code a for loop. 😅"
21,@emcorinne Everyone I know (besides you) went over 4 turns. You’re so good at this.

40,This was just from today’s mail. We’ve never shopped at any of these brands. Genuinely interested in the data driving this. Are physical catalogs to likely buyers better than retargeting these days? https://t.co/XvzK2HkDaJ https://t.co/U3WhHq0yl9

51,"@nkohari @averyj 400k domains and 150k paying, recurring customers for a few years now. Wasn’t built overnight, but the DAO tokens are pretty smart and well thought out. it’s only valued that high because people like James and I will never sell our voting tokens 😁"
52,"There’s something actually really special going on in web3, even if you ignore NFTs. DNS, distributed storage, low latency k/v stores, elimination of user/pass, community, and a focus on privacy/security/fun. We’re all having a blast creating things. Come join us. 😁 https://t.co/zQXSa2b8AN"
53,"A month-ish ago, I was at a bar and Shazammed(?) this song. It’s such an earworm, and I can’t get the bassline out of my head. Weird, dark, synthpop. I’m now a fan. https://t.co/KhAyJz1j52"

90,@natehunzaker That’s one of them 😂
91,Kind of nuts at how many physical catalogs our household gets from DTC brands these days. Printing and shipping can’t be cheap. Have spam filters basically killed email marketing? Or have ad blockers made retargeting for savvy users ineffective?
