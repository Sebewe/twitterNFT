25,@NotEasyAx @Schmiddel89 Also i dont trust people talking about pure axies being the best. Competitive best builds will still be mixed imo.
26,@NotEasyAx @Schmiddel89 Yes but for example assuming both nimo tail and nimo ears makes you still gain energy for 0 (pure speculation) the combo telescope + nimo is going to be very solid. On aqua cards teams of course.
27,@NotEasyAx @Schmiddel89 Draw awua cards whats the problem? You can draw cards for you awua friends!
28,@NotEasyAx @Schmiddel89 Why? Telescope is going to be a key card in the new game imo. Essential to control you card draw since cards are discarded every turn
