9,"Mint details! The community was given the power to vote on the mint price for Muri, which is wonderful to hear. Far too many cash grabs with no delivery on utility these days. The community chose this thanks @MuriNFT 🙏 💯 https://t.co/OXNurUs9Rf"

13,"@HollerLeanne Real talk @CatBloxStudios is dope. Puma is just collab number one and we don’t have details yet on what the collab entails, but it feels juicy. I swept a total of 10 on secondary including 1/1’s so I’m bullish. https://t.co/XHCUDoafJX"

23,@0xLiteFlex @doodles I think Yee!! But I’m a degen. Don’t forget that 😉
24,@RTFKTLukson Wait. You didn’t even say what for!! 😅 oh man this tweet is a real illustration!!
25,@RTFKTLukson That’s an awful lot of retweets my friend 😂 😂😂😂
26,It was the cheapest NFT I have bought. Ever. I wasn’t able to right click save my assets so screen shots are the best I could do. But I want to support these projects and get the word out so other creators who really want to support genuine folks know where to find them. 🙏
27,I would challenge you to go to https://t.co/CUBkcsmIOy and read about the art and the vision and get to know the people behind this project. They are passionate and serious people here in web3 and are doing this for a good cause. Go and read please!! I minted 2 at 1 SOL.
28,"I stack eth too, but there is more to web3 than currency for me. This art may shock you when you see it, but shouldn’t you ask some questions about why? There is a reason this art shocks you. Aren’t you sick of all the same art with no real cause or passion behind a roadmap?"
29,"Why are we so hesitant to put money into a project that’s so different and unique and is actually being launched by some great people who want to use their NFT to make a difference in the world? Are we really here just to stack eth? If so, fair enough.👇"
30,I minted 2 @thelipsoflove today to support some good people launching an NFT for a good cause. This project is operated by some wonderful women (and men) who have entered the space. I see so many of us minting garbage that has no passion behind it. Why?? https://t.co/fgcLV4ZJgv
31,@shaqfreeze123 @InvsbleFriends Chill one!!
32,@zee_astrokid @InvsbleFriends Yeah I always said if the floor got down near five I would start shopping and I did! Love the art on these and I know there’s more to come so I said yolo!

Even if we don’t come to an agreement we are catblox fam so let’s at least talk and see."
