1. Building a plan/framework for my pfp free to mint + gas NFT project. Intentions are to benefit the mental health community.

11,Pixel Vault Mintpass #1 is still the coolest thing. It’s true random generation via Chainlink at the time of burning the mintpass. Majority of projects coming out now aren’t truly randomly generated.

46,"@TommyAvalanche @beaniemaxi How so? He was the Co-creator of Pixel Vault, PUNKS Comic Issue #1, and the Metahero Universe. I’ve been on every single spaces since before the PUNKS Issue #1 even minted. How would the previous bio encompass more than that? He helped with tokenomics as well."
47,"@TommyAvalanche @beaniemaxi He funded the entire project from the beginning, created value on top of value for holders. Helped with the mintpass. If you chose to mint comics then you are sitting pretty, if not then that’s your fault. Plus much more that I haven’t mentioned"
