29,"Ultimately, all I ask is that you consider how private sales may impact artists and projects &amp; consider finding happy mediums between personal short term profit and commitment to supporting people, community and the nft market at large. Much love to all."
30,"Beyond supporting creators, I do wish the marketplace fees felt like they were reinvested back into their platforms to show value for service fees but I believe this will be reconciled as new entrants like @Coinbase_NFT join the space and create competition."
31,"Please note, I am not judging anyone for doing private deals. I have done them in the past &amp; I recognize that decentralized web 3 is about our rights as individuals. With that said, i believe public sales via marketplace are a long term investment in the NFT space overall."
32,"All #nftcollectors I know hold devs accountable for building the projects &amp; talk about “wen devs” at any sign of decreased value or volume.

Yet when we do private deals we’re taking royalties &amp; resources away from the project while still asking them to do more but with less."
33,"Why I will no longer do private sales #NFTs (a 🧵): 

I used to do private deals &amp; didn’t think much about its impact on projects. Now, as an advisor/member of an nft project &amp; seeing how much hardwork goes into it, I realize how important it is to help the projects we ♥️ thrive."
