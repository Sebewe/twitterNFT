6,Imo those are forever grails https://t.co/YHTYvEUbky
7,"@Gorki_Sabroski @oktalize Hey, nobody knows what will happen with anything here. Usually projects go down in price after reveal, but some outliers don’t. I hope this one doesn’t because I bought, but that’s not the usual thing. If you’re new to NFTs I wouldn’t suggest buying an unrevealed 1eth project."

12,@0xbaggyclothes Lol. Hideous too. But not at 2.4eth floor yet at least

20,"@pier_bf @CoolmanUniverse Oh congratulations then, it’s a great one!"
21,@pier_bf @CoolmanUniverse He’s currently bookmarked in my browser
22,@CardinalNFT Exactly my thoughts.
23,"The concept of “announcements” it’s what usually drives floors up and then violently down in a very unhealthy way. 

Teams should (imho) reduce their communities’ expectations (and speculation) by being less secretive about what’s coming in the announced-announcement dates."
24,"@IamDannnyy @CoolmanUniverse Oh I see. You’re right. I’m looking for floors tbh, your dino is too elegant for my budget."
25,@IamDannnyy @CoolmanUniverse Ser that’s a lovely dino for sure but please don’t try door-to-door salesman tactics with me lol
26,@broadspectrum @CoolmanUniverse Wow

30,"@Jaiboon_NFT @0xBruceB @CoolmanUniverse Yeah. Some nudes too, and I want a nude so bad. I will decide during the day."

37,"In these mini bear markets people will make the most ridiculous analogies. Pure bias. Accept that you don’t know anything, stop searching for repeating patterns. There’s too little history to do that. Being here in 2017 means a lot less than what people would like it to be."

43,@DollarCAvenger @doodles @CoolmanUniverse Thanks. He’s a good cat.
44,"@DollarCAvenger @doodles @CoolmanUniverse I like the nudes and some baby holders more than Wall Street. I always wanted a nude, but also wanted an iggy. Both have high strong floors now, I wasn’t mistaken."
45,@DollarCAvenger @doodles @CoolmanUniverse A grail
46,@DollarCAvenger @doodles @CoolmanUniverse Mmm. There’s a case for iggy babies.
47,"@ryancarson That’s normal for every new venture or industry. This is still a small one. Will improve, and when it does, making money on it will be 100x harder that what it is now."

51,"@OGDfarmer Well, Charlie is very good at probabilities, and he’s no VC. He was right on the probability analysis, even Musk agreed at the time. The way investors see the world isn’t and shouldn’t be the same way bold entrepreneurs see it, and there’s nothing wrong with that."

93,"@kingg_eth Yes, but is a team effort anyway, an effort that can be better deploying other initiatives, specially seeing cases like robotos or woodies where a lot of effort has been put on worthless airdrops. Those projects have been a true long agony and teams are really good."
94,I thing that dropping some heterogeneous polygon airdrop to your holders adds really little or no value at all. Hope I’m wrong but that’s what I’ve seen so far.
