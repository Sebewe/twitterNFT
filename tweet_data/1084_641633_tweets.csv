2,@Nitin_wysiwyg Haha yes deadlines work surprisingly well. But I don’t like the stress they put on me so I tend not to use them much
3,"@peterbrinkhuis Thanks, will try that! Putting thoughts and plans on paper does indeed often clarify and make me consider the most efficient path forward."
4,Please don’t say skip trying to rewire your brain and just stop doing it 🤣
5,"I have a tendency to think I need to do X before I can do Y. But often there’s a way to skip X and do Y directly.

Any advice on how to rewire my brain?"

8,"Feels weird publicising a donation. Understand if you question my motives. But my hope is that it inspires more people to donate what they can.

Based it on WIP's revenue, so the community automatically is involved. Hopefully inspiring further participation."
9,"Donated this month's @WIP revenue to Red Cross Ukraine 🇺🇦

You can do the same. Even a small contribution helps. Don't overthink the amount/method/etc. Better to do something, than nothing.

10,"Got interviewed by @sarmariewright on how I build products and when to learn new tools versus using the ones I already know. And a lot more.

16,"Can’t wait for the reveal.

20 artists each created an NFT and as a @proof_xyz member I get to choose and mint one.

The catch? We won’t know which artists are behind the works until after minting completes.

Fun fact: I acquired this domain name a while back, but never got around to using it. Jijo bought it from me and launched something much better than I could have. 👌"

24,"@jcvangent My issue with the + trick is that anyone can fake it, but I guess that hardly happens in practice?"
25,https://t.co/5LpgBrXI2Q has something similar as native functionality. But if you prefer Fastmail etc you can set this up yourself.
26,"Trick I’ve been using:

1. Dedicated email address for non-human senders (online accounts etc)
2. Automatically move these emails to separate (hidden) folder
3. Smart folder that shows just these emails, but only if unread

34,@heathermhuang @Wii_Mee @ryancarson How did you get the US card? That’s the part I’m stuck at 😅
35,@ryanseanbadger Haha yeah
36,@ryanseanbadger Yeah I might do that. But right now it even works if you enter a nearby location we don’t have an exact match for. Which is kind of nice.
37,@patio11 Render = 👌
38,@gherget Oh great idea. Thanks. Will give that a try!
39,"@tommoor Yes for sure. I already have a caching layer in place, but perhaps it's being cleared out too fast. Currently investigating"

41,"Geocoding API calls should be cached, so it doesn't hit the API twice for the same query. But seems like maybe that's not working correctly.

Right now doing 40k calls per month which seems like a lot 😅"
42,"Not the clearest graph, but Google Cloud Platform estimates $530 for this month.

Majority of cost is geocoding location strings (e.g. ""New York"") to their normalized names and coordinates.

The rest is Google Places Autocomplete (e.g. searching for ""Bang"" shows ""Bangkok"", etc)"

Appreciate the help but I don’t think anyone figured out yet the exact workaround. Although some people seem lucky and it works for them."
48,@heathermhuang @ryancarson That’s not enough. They also check payment method.
