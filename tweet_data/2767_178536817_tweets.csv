0,@niftytime @xanderatallah the specifics are on the last announcement on their discord. It’s quite a lot to regurgitate here. If you’re on it highly suggest giving it a read! 🙏🏼
1,@beeple fingers crossed.
2,@andrwwang 😂😂😂
3,@xanderatallah I feel like Azuki’s method of fractionalizing a specific NFT and building sub-communities around that character is a very interesting take. Reminds me of MasterWorks in web2. Creating accessibility to highly demanded NFT.
4,"@yo i got you, will call it crypto currency. sound good?"
5,"in my opinion the most important aspect of an NFT project is the team behind it.

Everything else is circumstantial, and can quickly change.

The only way the project adapts and succeeds is if the team has the relevant proven experience."
6,@ishverduzco @StarcatchersNFT @Beutrec @ethmaurice @RovyETH welcome! ⭐️ https://t.co/LpskGchQLQ
7,"If you are just now getting into NFT’s don’t panic. You are still very early! 

Take time to educated yourself, and form genuine relationships.

Every industry is about to be revolutionized by their utility, and you could be the one to lead it."
8,@NotYourBroNFT proud to be a holder! love to see this type of action and inclusion.
9,"The integration of NFTs into Streetwear is not only elevate the NFT space, but also completely transform streetwear brands.

I am already seeing fashion brands in all verticals integrate usage, but very excited for the real utilities to start being built. #web3"
10,"Amazing meeting with the @DegenToonz team today at our LA office. The level of detail, and the thought process behind the apparel brand they want to create is phenomenal. Very exited to work together. Can’t wait for you all to see!🚀"
11,thought i got lucky and minted a @WonderPals only to realize the transaction failed. nice… 🙁
12,@kayla_NFT @sacred_skulls congrats! wishing you the best on this journey. exciting! 🙏🏼

16,"gm gm! remember to be kind, you never know what someone is going through ☀️"
17,@reli3fxyz amazing 🙏🏼
18,@tomgara i don’t think they can or should be. Putin is going to be even more dangerous if he’s allowed to go back to business as usual. He needs to be removed in order to lift sanctions. In my personal opinion.
19,"@0xAlexander Bacari on 3rd, Tatel, Bestia, Spago, Avra, Din Tai Fung, Yazawa, Quarters, and many more."

26,"If you see a celebrity who is not educated on, or has previously showed genuine interest in the space endorsing a project.. be very careful with that project! #nft #web3"
27,"Since 2012, I’ve spent close to $20MM USD on Influencers and Meme Pages on behalf of startups in Web2.

I can with all my experience, and confidence say that this strategy will not translate into long term success in web3."
28,@0xHustler @SavePlanetEarth you legend.
29,"@AB84 @boredpunksnft I understand you’re about the bag AB, and you got paid for this.. but you’re encouraging people to invest their hard earned dollars into what will most certainly be a loss. Why purposely do that to your fans?"
30,@andynewman @StarcatchersNFT yes it has! i love it haha it’s so clean. yours is sick too that cloud jacket is 🔥🔥
31,"Been spending countless hours on Twitter Spaces over the last few weeks to educate myself on NFTS and all things web3. Still got a long way to go, but excited to be able to eventually be an educator myself. We need more educators. #web3 #nft"
32,"@FedorovMykhailo @johnbiggs @dmarket They clearly said otherwise on their page, but I like the initiative! 🙏🏼"
33,@WonderPals Make them available to discord members please 🥺
34,@NFTs_girl it needs to be. long overdue 🙏🏼
35,"@bobbyhundreds i was on the WL for both, but decided to stay out of the mess. I hope for a amicable resolution so the communities behind them don’t get the short end of the stick."

37,"@Kanra_cosplay This has nothin to do with Only Fans, it’s a SWIFT issue. Since the US and Europe cut Russia off from SWIFT there is no way to process payments at all."

41,@TheMiamiApe I’m here!
42,@theRealKiyosaki i don’t think this is a time to talk about us. Focus awareness and attention on Ukraine.
43,RT @elonmusk: @FedorovMykhailo Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.
44,@Helloimmorgan that’s probably because they’re using a print to order service. I can’t wait to elevate the space in this regard. Look at my pinned tweet!
45,"RT @Ukraine: To the free people of the world!

46,@StarcatchersNFT take off! 🚀⭐️ https://t.co/c6Z41GlB44
47,"@M1Wizard You’re right, and even in web2 these things happen. Doxxing wont solve the issue but it does help minimize the opportunity to rug. Ultimately, founders will choose what they think is best and that’s the beauty of web3.. choice. But we do need better ways to protect consumers."
48,@NicoleBehnam we basically just said the same thing at the same time 😂
49,"I firmly believe that NFT project founders and their teams should be fully doxxed. If you’re asking for people to invest their hard earned money in your vision, they need to know who you are!"

60,"The new sanctions on Russia and it’s oligarchs are strong. However, it’s very likely that Putin has already factored this into his plan. The world needs to do more. Immediate action is necessary, in addition to these sanctions."
61,"@APompliano The world needs to follow, and cut them off from SWIFT."
62,"@metaversejoji in order to be verified you need to prove you are at risk of being impersonated. One key factor is media coverage, because it shows notoriety. If the project has a solid 5-7 articles you can apply via Twitter with high chances. 🙏🏼"
63,"Web3 is not just about decentralization and transparency. It’s also about community, inclusion, diversity. It’s time to show the power of the new era of web."
64,Web3 community: we must put humanity over profits. Let’s halt the shilling and focus on bringing attention and helpful initiatives to Ukraine. #PrayForUkraine

77,"🚨NFT project Founders: if you’re interested in developing an elevated apparel brand or collectibles around your project. NOT basic merch. Please DM me. LA based operation, 20+ years in business. Produce for large Streetwear brands."
78,@ammtonym let’s talk about a collectible partnerships like bear bricks and streetwear apparel manufacturing. I’d love to help make some of these visions come to life.
79,@mustachedave @StarcatchersNFT Blast off 🚀⭐️
80,RT @mustachedave: all aboard⭐️💫✨ https://t.co/pNUJdUKf2W
81,@CNN Not good.
82,"@BizarreBoysNFT How the team highlights them is not nearly as important as the public information available. It’s like when building a resume, you’ll always list the best parts. DYOR on the team, look at their history, find references. Must be full doxed."
83,"NFTs provide a low barrier to entry for people who wouldn’t otherwise be able to be investors in startups. The web3 version of crowdfunding, Angel investing."
84,"A roadmap is purely speculative, and while it provides insights into the vision of the founder in most cases it will not be followed as initially described. Expect many changes. This is why the team and the community plays a more valuable role in determining the strength."
85,"🧵On Roadmaps: I might be relatively new to NFTS but not new to the start up eco-system, which is essentially what a well structured NFT project is. After spending 10+ years in web2 start up companies, I can confidently say that a roadmap should be the least of concerns."
86,"@chriscantino @StarcatchersNFT Did you check the excel sheet to make sure wallet address was in it yesterday? If not, do that really quickly."
