11,@vrypan You are too 🙏
12,"Thanks also to ""vault0x.eth"" who has donated the first NFT to be auctioned off on this new tool: ""Day 19"" from @GalleryXXVII.

https://t.co/pX5BXiwMr7"
13,"Special thanks to @0xAkuti who has been tirelessly pair programming this with me!

We're developing all of this in the open. You can follow along in the @PunkScape Discord."
14,If an auction's starting price isn't met within 24 hours the donor can withdraw their NFT.
15,"The bidding system is copied from the @GalleryXXVII contracts we built over the last months.

A simple web application will make interfacing with the smart contract simple and straight forward."
16,"Its functionality is very simple...

Send and ERC721 or ERC1155 NFT to the contract (to be deployed), which automatically starts a 24h auction.

When the auction is settled, all funds are automatically rerouted to the charity, and the NFT is transferred to the winning bidder."
17,The contract code is still in development and testing but you can read through it here: https://t.co/R3Siocuww4

20,"Why? 

We're all confused. And we all want to help.

Liquidating NFTs to donate funds is hard. It results in transaction fees on the donation and/or requires trust in the seller to reroute the funds to the appropriate destination.

The new smart contract solves both issues."
21,"Last night a few friends started building a zero fee smart contract that enables anyone to auction off their NFT with all funds securely going to @Unchainfund for humanitarian relief in the #Ukraine 🇺🇦

29,"Similarly, economic sanctions can only be effective if enforced globally, by everyone. Otherwise, in our current global structure, if the west shuts down, the east will open up.

In the end game, economic sanctions hurt the people more than anything."
30,"Our current intergovernmental bodies (e.g. the United Nations) have their hearts in the right place, but the inability to disarm and deescalate aggression and enforce both Human Rights and The Law of Nations shows it is not yet living up to its promise."
31,"All governments and nations will support this world legislative body; If any nation disrespects the ruling of any unanimous or majority vote, all will stand up and enforce the decisions of the world legislative."
32,"A nation can not exist without a functioning legal system.

Similarly, our modern world can not exist without a functioning global legal system. 

This should be obvious... A legal system is of no use, if there is no body to enforce it."
33,"The world is in dire need for a functioning world legislature and a world executive force that rises up against any aggressor, immediately shuts down any unjust act, and brings everyone back to diplomacy and negotiations."

36,"Unity is the most important power. 

Cohesion and attraction is life;
Decomposition is death.

Unity is life. Disunity is death."
37,"When united, we can, quite literally, build paradise on earth.

And if we can, it is our obligation to. Is this not the purpose of life? To fulfil our highest potential? To go through the stages of civilisation and come together in ever greater forms of unity?"
38,"Unity is more important than anything else in the world.

When we're at war, we create the most terrible atrocities and suffering no mind can fathom.

But when united, we are an antifragile system. We solve the most difficult problems and overcome incredible hardship."
39,"""Being right"" is for the simplistic mind. No one can claim they are right.

We can only find truth through unity.

The only thing that is right is unity.

https://t.co/QKDkI2GXoY"
40,"When two parties fight, both lose. When they unite, both win.

Now, in this information age, when we keep them to ourselves we don't gain anything. When we share our ideas, all become wealthy.

The light of consciousness shines brighter."
41,"Similarly, when we humans unite, we grow and will find truth.

Unity does not mean holding hands and singing kumbaya.

Unity means coming together with a common goal: Building an ever advancing civilisation. Securing the wellbeing of all the worlds people."
42,"This goes deeply against our understanding of the world, but i believe it is essential to growth.

Imagine, from the previous example, copper would argue with tin over the fact that it is the stronger metal.

They would never come together to form bronze, the much stronger alloy."
43,We must learn to value unity over being right.
44,"How is unity possible?

When we learn to forgive. When we overcome the desire of revenge and vengeance. When we ignore our individual shortcomings.

This is true for for all levels of human interaction. It's true for a marriage just as much as it is for nation states."
45,"""So powerful is the light of unity that it can envelop the whole world"".

We humans are capable of that. We've come so far already. Global peace and understanding is inevitable."
46,"Human life has lived through so many stages of complexity... 

We're on the verge of the most simple, complex and beautiful form of life we've ever seen.

For the first time in human history, global unity is feasible."
47,"Similarly, when we (as people) unite, we create life.

From the family, to the tribe, to villages, to cities, city states, nations and empires.

When there is unity, there is life."
48,"Take water...

Hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) are distinct atoms.

Both highly inflammable substances.

But when they join together, they can form a strong bond and become the opposite of fire. The life-giving substance we call water."
49,"Tin and copper are still within bronze and separate again when melting the alloy.

So unity does not equal ""sameness"".
Unity means unity in diversity. Strong bonds of different things."
50,"This makes no sense on first sight: Take something weak and join it with something weak to create something strong.

This simple discovery changed all of human civilisation, in fact we call over 2k years of history by it: The Bronze Age."
51,"Copper and tin are two different metals. Both are quite weak. Until someone had the absurd idea to melt and join them together.

The result is bronze. 

A multitude stronger than both copper and tin."
52,"Unity is strange and defies common logic. 

Take these examples from our physical world:"
53,"Unity, beauty, cohesion, life, and love are all one and the same thing. Both in our human relationships as well as in physical reality.

I don't mean this in an esoteric way at all..."
54,"On the sad developments of today...

One concept that took me years to understand is that unity is more important than anything else.

It is the foundation of everything we cherish."

56,"@mryxji @tw1tte7 @Aelio33 @dutchtide @GalleryXXVII Thank you sire!

Just be careful when buying one day punks - i built them in a way that forces complete 1/1 distribution within the smart contract. So purchases of multiple tokens fail. A wallet can only ever hold one (hence the 10k unique holders on OpenSea)."
