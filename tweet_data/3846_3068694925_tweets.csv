14,"@DomainKing @DNJournal 100% agree.

We only differ on how things are interpreted by the majority of followers.

.com is the pinnacle but if you only had $15k to invest in domains the last 24 months I think there is a strong argument that top tier SLD’s in io/co/xyz have outperformed your average .com."
15,"@DomainKing @DNJournal And you were 100% correct 25 years ago. Those that listened did well.

The climate for novice investors today is very different though."
16,"@DomainKing @DNJournal 😆… 99.99% of your audience can’t buy the best .coms though.

Nobody is denying that .com is the best. I sold 2 .coms for close to $2m last year.

I compete fairly well thanks."
17,"@DomainKing @DNJournal DN Journal reports high value .com sales.

If you bought a decent .io/.co/.org/.xyz for $1,500 wholesale last 24 months you’ve done significantly better than if you paid $1,500 for a mediocre .com.

Anyone with an expansive view on the entire market will know this is true."

More recently top tier SLD’s in io/co/org and even xyz have performed better than .coms with an acquisition cost in a similar price range."

No.
