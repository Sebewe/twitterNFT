I don't want you to answer this one
I just hope you get my point
thank you for engaging, respect💜"
5,"@boredgentleman 1-do you see this status quo last forever?
if no.
2-how do you see people using NFTs in the future?"
6,"@boredgentleman first NFT is something different that BTC and ETH, it's like comparing apple and oranges.
second you said NFT, so you made your statement generalized, even in the future and not just connecting your words to the status quo, so my 2 questions to you"
7,@boredgentleman are you serious?
8,"@fancyrats_eth it's more of a way to connect the wallets to each other, as presentation and privileges, I am not a technical guy so I don't know how it can bee applied but I have the vision and the imagination to see this"
9,"@fancyrats_eth I was thinking about this a lot, an NFT to prove the ownership of an NFT, that gives you the same limited access/claim to an item or service"
10,@SpeculatorArt I like your perspective : )

49,"@HollanderAdam @whitesandsgame I know where to find what the projects is about if I wanted to, but I didn't care, my comment is not specified for this, it's regardless what the project is about, using numbers as marketing point is not healthy way to do it, people will notice them, but you don't talk about it."
50,"@HollanderAdam @whitesandsgame maybe they joined just to do quick flip, maybe they are bots not real people, I am not saying that they are, that's not the point, if you focus on numbers you will lose attention for building, also some of bad projects has a lot of numbers and that's not a metric to measure value"
51,@hunterorrell love you for this hunter!💜
52,"@whitesandsgame that's exactly nothing, I have no Idea what this project is about, just focus on building not the numbers, when you provide value, numbers will follow not the other way around!"

62,"@NicoleBehnam but you do, don't you?
that's why you will dress in a professional way to a meeting, I don't care what people think about my mind set attitude perspective, but appearance, if you want to make it big and exchange value with people, you did wear what people familiar with."
63,"@cdemente1 @NFTCryptoChicks I am not going to be surprised if the people stealing the content accuse the actual creators of trying to steal from them.
but to the average buyer on the chain he can just compare the dates when minted, and that alone will lead to actions like buying..."
64,"@cdemente1 @NFTCryptoChicks its about prove of ownership, intellectual ownership can be proven sometimes by providing a content posted on social platforms or blogs, but with time pass on people going to believe the data and dates on blockchain"

70,"@Ape7068 @HolocronApe I get you, I believe he estimated from how many holders, and as I said it's not gonna give you a clear answer to your question, it's huge challenge to know the exact number coz people have multiple wallets, best number you can get is how many unique wallets are there. ✨"
71,"@Ape7068 @HolocronApe check on opensea how many owners in each collection, it's not very accurate but it helps to understand."

81,"@kingkong45_eth @yugalabs @BoredApeYC I have 2 MAYC and I don't know how much is the floor, just because I'm not buying more rn, the next time I am checking it will be to buy more, you want hype or healthy growth and value?"
82,"@mattborchert those lists gonna die, in the future most of the NFT you are getting, you just claim for free, or you pay high, when the utility market gets activated, now this collectables and play to win, those not actual games for me, I am talking about fun to play games that has web3 power."

86,"@rcastr @paulg I agree about that, what I am saying is..
are people employed in the company are happy? and does it have a healthy work place?
that what I meant, coz if it is not, you gonna lose your best brains to other companies in the long run."
87,"@rcastr @paulg I have similar mind set for paying attention to the very small details, but in the same time I know how and when to trust people."
88,"@rcastr @paulg It could be, we only see the public image, most of the time it's different than the truth, but what we see is the truth until it's not!
the reason I mentioned that, coz I study such human behaviors specially in business, and it's an interesting case going in front of me"
89,"@paulg I know somebody working on their management team said to me that Elon is micro managing everything, every new hire should go through him! that sounded crazy to me, I can relate to that, but getting bigger and scaling is huge challenge to keep up with both!"
