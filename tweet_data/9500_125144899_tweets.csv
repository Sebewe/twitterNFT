4,"3/ There is plenty of wrongdoing within the NFT “space” for legitimate criticism or better yet, education to protect oneself. But saying that this particular kind of blockchain token is a scam simply doesn’t make much sense."
5,2/ Please understand what you are criticizing before you criticize.
6,"1/ Saying NFTs are a scam is like saying email is a scam. 

The Non Fungible Token is an amazing technological concept, and yes, people use that type of token to scam the shot out of people. 

Ever heard of phishing scams those happen mostly through email."
7,@GoldsMatthew @DocBrownLloyd @BoredApeYC Email is a scam too. I can prove it because you know there is a Saudi prince that wants to give me money. The bad actors and scammers are there and doing their thing. That doesn’t make the technology a scam.
8,@DonryuArt @truecoreyparker @DocBrownLloyd @BoredApeYC There is a reason Mastercard is partnering with Coinbase to enable users to buy nfts without crypto…
9,"@DonryuArt @truecoreyparker @DocBrownLloyd @BoredApeYC And completely one sided and unbiased. Sat through the whole thing. Not only does he ignore the other side to it (legitimate teams delivering to their communities), this idea that the entire nft culture is to make ppl buy crypto is ludicrous."
10,@gremlin_icon @noobguy57 @DocBrownLloyd June - august according to @VitalikButerin :)
11,@BerkmanOnlyfans @DocBrownLloyd @BoredApeYC And yes there are scams and worthless nfts out there. People tricking others into giving them eth for practice nothing of any value in return. But the technology of a blockchain based token that is unique has many many game changing applications and uses outside of art.
12,@BerkmanOnlyfans @DocBrownLloyd @BoredApeYC I personally feel that generative art that has the code to generate the picture stored in the actual blockchain is the only thing that comes to actually owning the art itself.
13,@BerkmanOnlyfans @DocBrownLloyd @BoredApeYC The jpeg is not the point for every NFT. Nft series like Bored Apes are more of a membership token rather than the art. In regards to actual art (not clubs..)

And that mfer’s name does not rhyme with Freig Fright."
