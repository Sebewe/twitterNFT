I don't agree that the 0x collection damages the BAYC brand, it just onboards an additional area of collectors. A quick look around will also show that many BAYC/MAYC owners are taking part in the community."

I love the BAYC project, but I wasn't around for mint and can't afford the current floor. When I saw the 0x collection I bought out of admiration for the BAYC..little did I know I would find this community. A lot of B/MAYC have joined us for this reason."
