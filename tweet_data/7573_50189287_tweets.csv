1,@SnoopDogg Bought it 🔥🔥🔥
2,@SnoopDogg Gm!
3,@Kyloren_NFT @BoredApeYC Love that Ape
4,"@gpunknft Very interesting take. Some thoughts that came to mind; China still being the 2nd biggest US debt holder, hence a notable difference to Russia, how does that affect their play ? Also China is unlikely to make a move that would put at risk their economy(unlike Russia)."
5,@dt_chain Big fan of the M2 mutant. Tempting package
6,Coinbase has an average growth per quarter of 8.6% in 2021 while @investvoyager has an average growth of 52% a quarter in 2021 https://t.co/4scVNDWLcW

8,@bag_hodler @investvoyager Interesting graph ! A picture is worth a thousand words. Wonder how $COIN would compare ?
9,@FrenchBAYC @fudmaster_nft @BoredApeYC GM !
10,@WilliamCush @ryancarson @Coinbase_NFT I don’t disagree with that
11,"@ryancarson @Coinbase_NFT If it behaves like any asset, blue chip projects will be the ones not only  surviving a correction but also getting stronger. So basically, if one feels the mkts is risky now , either get out of it or get in established names. Also, no risk no reward 😅😂"
12,"@Irenezhao_ Crypto is still perceived by many as a risk asset /investment, therefore in times of important geopolitical risk, ppl tend to fly away from risky assets. Ironically for crypto, the more adoption it has, the more correlated it will be to a traditional tech/risky assets"

45,"@PapaJacks_NFT @animocabrands But again, @BoredApeYC brand is so strong. They could launch it linked or not linked to any specific new project/milestone and it would be a success 🔥🔥"
46,"@PapaJacks_NFT @animocabrands I could be completely off - and probably am 😅. But @animocabrands is, among many things, known for their great experience in gaming and tokenization - ie REVV , they also à foot in metaverse. Frankly the partnership with @animocabrands is understated."
47,"@PapaJacks_NFT For sure , keepin ammo ready ! Also wondering whether they are going to coordinate the token launch with whatever they working on with @animocabrands"
48,@PapaJacks_NFT the right to buy some limited amount of the  token at a preferred rate before the token gets open to all

Managing such growth and being a public company is no small accomplishment. and yet they still have so much in their pipeline, and massive market growth ahead of them. It takes time, be patient.

99,"@just1n_eth @BuzzFeedNews BuzzFudnews have always been trash news aiming for the clicks more than quality content. I think we should simply a) block them - and b) not mention them in our tweets. They are looking for exposure, and by #ing them we are giving what the want"
