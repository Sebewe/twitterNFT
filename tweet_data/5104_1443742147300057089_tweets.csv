It was primarily related to when people make these ""What if..."" narratives opposed to seeing which scenario is most plausible.

80,"@presxien @opensea @LilBabyApeClub @LilBabyApeClub1 @LBACofficial Yo! I appreciate this note. You bring up real concerns with the DMCA claim that Kakashi will need to sift through, although the community advice to him is to move forward with a lawyer if his current claim doesn't get accepted.
