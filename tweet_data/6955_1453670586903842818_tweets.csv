12,"I've been in several #NFT discords where only ""hype vibes"" were allowed. Constructive criticism gets shut down hella quick.
What people overlook is that it may be #web3 but there's still a human factor to it. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Maybe the metaverse will at least have no metawars in it. 💔"

31,"@MetaNFTs_ @Bruckzr @0xfoobar If you sign this txn with a fake contract, not https://t.co/ub4a2Lhp4W and Set approval for all for a collection you are done. https://t.co/s1dMF14yXd"
32,@RealDuckMaster @WTCnft for sure. Ask @SyntribosStable
33,@MetaNFTs_ @Bruckzr @0xfoobar Approve all has nothing to do with a Ledger. That is a contract function.
34,@wuestenigel Still thinking about doing something similar. Good content mate!
35,@mitkopitko7 Appreciate every education we can get.
36,"@MetaNFTs_ @Bruckzr @0xfoobar If you sign an ""approve all"" with a coldwallet you are also done. That's what happened here it seems.
If you trust a proven project you might mint from your coldwallet. But don't do that for unknown mints."
37,"@RomanCraig15 Nah, just keep panicing and sh*tting on OS for doing nothing wrong. Yet claiming ""free"" airdrops and listing collections on unkown ""new"" NFT sites. It's getting ridiculous."

93,"@CRAnthony3 Always have an open DM if someone wants to reach out and needs to vent, champ. 💜"
94,"@stavianafam @Lazy_Degenerate Totally get you Stav. Even more if you are a mod I think. Perfectly fine to check back with projects and talk community from time2time. It's just nothing one should sacrifice sleep, loved ones, health etc. for in my humble opinion."
95,"@Lazy_Degenerate @stavianafam Set hours for research if you want to buy in a project. Take your time for research in that period. No need to stay constantly alert to all those influence and keeping up with it IMO, it's exhausting (at least for me)."
96,@stavianafam Agree it gets super addicting and that's why I chose to pull back. Would suggest you try it out for a few days or even the weekend.
97,"@stavianafam Yea absolutely, hard to have FOMO if you don't know whats happening really."
98,"Almost 4 days in, got to say: Staying away from Twitter and Discord is a true relief. 💯"
