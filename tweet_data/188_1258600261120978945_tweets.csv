69,@KranDizzle S’all good!
70,@KranDizzle I’m mainly speaking of my own experiences as I am a part of these communities though. I’ve essentially felt alienated from these “inclusive” spaces simply for being in web 3.
71,@MarkhorNft I’ve encountered non binary/trans folks who have spoken to me privately about not outting themselves or using their pronouns due to fear of being victimized or experience abuse.
72,@MarkhorNft Yeah there’s this exclusion from what is supposed to feel like an inclusive community simply because we’re a part of web 3.
73,RT @funclesnft: official statement from funcles https://t.co/E4ZPJ2Tq3K
74,"@MarkhorNft Yet it’s the opposite for folks in web 3 who are a part of these communities who have found value, opportunities, etc. web 3 still doesn’t address the rampant misogyny though 🤦"
75,"@MarkhorNft I’m also a part of these communities, I’m a very left leaning poc that is demi. I basically meant that it’s fascinating seeing the communities I’m a part of hate on web 3 that haven’t researched or explored it."
76,@KranDizzle I’ve seen a lot of hate of the web 3 space by communities I’m also a part of that have never interacted with web 3 and it fascinates me because I’ve interacted with people who are also a part of those communities but *have* explored web 3 with a different opinion.
