15,"@odrikez @DangVinh1f9oz6c @LynAldenContact Under POS you'll get slashed so the attacker will need to buy more ETH (while making everyone rich) to attack again. If they do again, they get slashed. So if they have infinite money and infinite liquidity then they can keep attacking over and over. But bitcoin only two shot."
16,"@odrikez @DangVinh1f9oz6c @LynAldenContact Yes, ASICS are not easy to come by. This means under attack in a POW protocol you're pretty much screwed as you won't have the ASICS in time to regain control of the network. And the only other options would be to switch to GPU. 2 shot and you're screwed."

22,@mikealfred Can say the same for anti- Ethereum tweets too.
23,@ChrisBlec @MetaMask Would they? Maybe thru wallet connect? Cuz so far on most dapps there is usually a button for coinbase wallet and then metamask. So I'm not sure.
24,@ChrisBlec @MetaMask The only downside to this is wallet integration. Most daps will need add development to their front-end to support this new open source metamask alternative.

82,"@CryptoCrystalB1 @PixelCircuits @mdudas @Square There is nothing wrong about it. PoS allows anyone to participate. It is the whole point of decentralisation. 

&gt;Other than making sure your PC is switched on and connected to the internet.
What if it doesn't? Your stake will get slashed. Not all rainbow and unicorn my guy."
83,"@CryptoCrystalB1 @drspinntau @DefiDegen101 @mdudas @Square @argent It's jus the beginning! Not all layer 2 are the same. There are so many out there with much cheaper fees like loopring or polygon. And with sharding and eip 4488 will be pennies on rollups. Just the beginning.
Oh and solana? U mean the chain that needs a reboot every other day?"
84,"@CryptoCrystalB1 @PixelCircuits @mdudas @Square &gt;PoS is like allowing anyone to mine gold in their backyard. Much more similar to communism.

What's so wrong abt allowing anyone? That's the sole purpose of decentralisation is to allow anyone, big or small to participate. And you're right, only PoS allow it. PoW don't."
85,"@CryptoCrystalB1 @PixelCircuits @mdudas @Square &gt;it doesn't mean small players can't participate, it means working as a team is beneficial.
You mean not having any other choice than to team up cuz if they try to individually they will never win any reward against the big guys."
86,@CryptoCrystalB1 @PixelCircuits @mdudas @Square why the little guys is force to join a mining pool to split the rewards.
87,"@CryptoCrystalB1 @PixelCircuits @mdudas @Square at a nonce that match the network difficulty is given the right to add a new block. In a PoS, they are randomly chosen.
In a PoS system, everyone is on the same playing field, each validator node has an equal odds of getting choosen. In a PoW, the larger guys always wins. It is"
88,"@CryptoCrystalB1 @PixelCircuits @mdudas @Square &gt;Stakers can jus sit on their hands
That's jus false dude. A validator node and a miner both have the same responsibility, that is to add a new block and whoever adds the new block gets rewarded. Who adds a new block is where they differ. In PoW, the first person to arrive"
89,"@CryptoCrystalB1 @PixelCircuits @mdudas @Square &gt;Miner has to constantly do work to stay in a comfortable position
So? Other miners are doing the same competitive work. Still the person with largest hashpower gets the highest reward."
90,@PixelCircuits @CryptoCrystalB1 @mdudas @Square The PoS yields for most protocols are 5% APR this is way less than what mining pays. I have been mining since April and have made 90% already. That's 90% compare to the 5% I would get in staking.
91,"@PixelCircuits @CryptoCrystalB1 @mdudas @Square @CryptoCrystalB1 
How is this different in PoW? The larger hash power you have the more reward u get. And don't bring me the they have to energy as an expense. Big or small, everyone have to pay energy cost but in the end the person with largest hashpower gets the higher reward."
