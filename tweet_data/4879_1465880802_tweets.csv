1,"3/ In part, this is because future performance is more uncertain — Coinbase stated they expect monthly transacting users and trading volume to decline in Q1, with an expected total trading volume of $200B (down from $550B in Q4 2021)."
2,"2/ Yet the good news did little work for the share price, before it tumbled just above an all-time low, trading at 4x the ARR of the last quarter."
3,"1/ Coinbase Q4 2021 revenue was $2.5B -- meaningfully higher than the expected $1.9B, and up $585MM from the same quarter in 2020. The increase in revenue led to net income of $840MM, up from $177MM in the prior period. https://t.co/GmG7pMBa2u"

20,8/ More analysis of the latest here: https://t.co/mJqcrgWpA5
21,"7/ Alternately, the valuation divided into $50B of reserves is a hefty 20% – a very premium price. Further, the SPAC and fintech equity markets have been getting hammered for structural reasons, so this change is indeed surprising."
22,"6/ Circle is going to continue to be one of the main drivers for retail and institutional adoption. Yet, the $9B valuation divided by the 10,000 expected number of accounts in 2022 gives a value of $900,000 an account."
23,5/ Most income is earned through transaction and treasury services (TTS). Circle Accounts and API services – which now includes Circle Yield – allows users to earn higher interest rates on idle cash balances and aiding their working capital requirements.
24,4/ Integrating with products like @solana's @phantom  wallet aligns with the strategy discussed in our prior Circle long take – aggregating platforms for institutions &amp; individuals bridging between traditional and blockchain rails to generate income through USDC transaction fees.
25,"3/ The expansion of USDC can be partly attributed to their multi-chain integration on eight blockchains, including Solana and Avalanche."
26,"2/ The SPAC was priced at $4.5B in July, but the new numbers are at double the value. This increase is due to the rapid growth of Circle’s stablecoin USDC, which has exhibited 13X growth from 2021 and on-chain transfers surpassing $1.8 trillion. This is behind only Tether’s USDT."

84,"7/ For traditional brands, we are familiar with the demand for integration of financial services into the user’s digital experience -- called embedded finance"
85,"6/ But there’s also a lot of competition in the US, including well established public market players like Green Dot and The Bancorp."
86,5/ The acquisition of Wirecard UK in 2020 gave Railsbank card issuance technology — without all that accounting fraud — helping it launch a Credit Card-as-as-Service to US-based clients.
87,"4/ The London-based fintech has two clear customer segments: (1) neobanks and (2) traditional brands. Neobanks are digital storefronts that need digital financial products, like banking and credit."
88,3/ We think of it as a regulatory crowbar opening up bank data and functionality to third parties (3PPs).
