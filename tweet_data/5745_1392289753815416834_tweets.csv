7,"@Mingzin_ @defieye_io @DeFiTeddy2020 @sartoshi_nft 非常棒的文章，读完很有感触，我个人其实一直对NFT背后的这些文化很感兴趣

看到你文章里也说到了mfer和BAYC 的这种丧文化的比较，于是写了一点自己思考。其实来源于一个问题，就是BAYC的反建制的基因，会不会随着价格越来越高不可攀而慢慢淡去？

欢迎原作者和大家来找我讨论

8,"8) Lastly I would like to ask all the self-claimed degens what makes you one and why. Is it money? Is it a cool tag? Is it a mindset? Or is it just the time and place that makes you feel so locked up to escape this fucked up world? 

Welcome to web3 🙌"
9,"7) Truth is, art is not meant for ppl who worry about their next meal. This may sound condescending. 

I believe there are ppl out there having aesthetic eyes no matter what situation they are in, but I won’t be in the mood searching for beauty while my world is filled with filth"
10,"6) Going back to the question of pricing. I don’t think cost matters anymore at this point. The sentiment of anti-establishment, or whatever you’d like to call it, is not a privilege of “the poor”, however defined. Anti-establishment never meant affordable, and never will be."
11,"5) Think about Apple, especially for those who were lucky (old) enough to see the 1984 ad. Or a more recent example, Tesla. 

Both got into the market and quickly gathered a cult of believers with their anti status quo image. I can’t help but wonder, is it just all branding?"
12,"4) In individual cases, it’s a concept that appeals to anyone who feels the urge to fight the mainstream, the dominant discourse, that exists in every culture."
13,"3) The first question I’m pondering is what anti-establishment truly means? It seems like an underlying, sub-cultural, yet evergreen theme bound by temporal and geographic context."
14,"2) ""如果说Web3.0语境下的丧文化有社会阶层表现，mfers则是代表了后现代主义下的“无产阶级”，而 BAYC更像是现代主义语境里的精英们""

I've been thinking about this: 

Does the whole anti-establishment narrative of BAYC  die out when ""normal"" people can't afford it any more?"

lmk in the comments if you've tried this or you’re going through the same struggle https://t.co/OgM5HYqGon"
38,"The best part about this journal is, it literally takes only 5 minutes. And it’s probably the most effective thing I could ever do in 5 minutes. 

Name a better thing you can do in only 5 minutes.  Again, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying this def helps you, but it did help me."
39,"You probably think this sounds like bs and tbh that’s exactly how I felt. After two days of writing, I felt less anxious and more motivated. Just a little bit, but it worked. 

I actually finished some work and just random chores I’ve been procrastinating for a long time."

42,"Shout out to my friend @ryanli_me  for giving me this journal. I’d be lying if I say it is a panacea and just makes everything right instantly, but I do feel more productive, positive, and motivated after writing for 2 weeks."

44,"Idk if this happens to any of you guys but I just get upset for no reason sometimes, not passionate about work, life, or anything, really.

We do appreciate that you openly expressed your concerns and thank you for your feedback! 

Just wrote a thread to answer some of your questions and concerns. Feel free to stop by and check it out!

https://t.co/nBFcysPldu"
50,"@wongyeefoo @wsdxbz1 @CyberConnectHQ Thanks for your feedback! We will put more considerations into our protocol and product design. 

Also, feel free to take a look at my most recent thread, where I explained and answered some of the concerns! 

Lmk what you think"
51,"12) Last but not least, if you don’t mind, I'm more than happy to discuss your concerns &amp; answer any questions you may have over a Twitter Space that everyone is welcome to join! 

We know how important it is to have more open conversations and show gratitude for early members"
52,"11) Again, we realize it may have neglected some new Web3 dwellers. Going forward, our focus will be on where we create value for EVERYONE on Web3 and how everyone can contribute:"
53,10) I totally agree that all contributions should be recognized. Building connections and getting people involved in our protocol is effectively contributing to a system of holistic identities and user-centric web - a collective value creation of meaningful social experiences.
54,"9) We also have the Xmas POAP for everyone who helps us spread the word on Twitter; a builder POAP for our hackathon participants, and we will have a special POAP to reward our “Doorman” (mods) and contributors in our community."
55,"8) All you have to do is to verify your Twitter on CyberConnect and have at least 5 followers on CyberConnect. And we paid for all the gas fees.  

We were trying hard to make sure everyone has a fair chance to get a piece of something, an NFT, a POAP, or a unique role on Discord"
56,"7) POAP is just one of the many methods we reward our early adopters and contributors. 

For the exact same campaign, more than 27k unique addresses with previous on-chain activities have minted the “Verified Web3 Dwellers” NFT within two weeks."
57,"6) The emphasis for the“Web3 Curator”POAP is curation. Considering how early Web3 social is, we want to encourage users to discover early, follow and support Web3-native KOLs and projects, and spread the word for them. Then, the 10% early-movers and gem-seekers will get rewarded"
58,"5) Reputation matters, Web2 or not. With Web3 we make it better recognized and encourage people to accrue it from early on. 
Meanwhile, Web2 social will still be a significant part of our identity so it should be recognized and justly migrated to Web3 if you wish."
59,"4) Gotta be honest upfront, we wanted the campaign to help bootstrap our early adoption, so we could onboard more partners and so more value for our users out of connections and reputation. KOLs are crucial for evangelizing crypto space in general and Web3."
60,"3) On the contrary to “controlling your social activities”, we reclaim your social connection data which used to be locked in social platforms and give it back to you. You are solely responsible for how it grows and is used. 

Fact check."
61,"2) First of all, thank you @wsdxbz1 for openly expressing your concerns! 

To get things clear, we are not a “Web3 Twitter”. We're a social graph protocol - help everyone to have an identity that travels across all dApps, using the protocol standards to deliver better experiences"
62,"1) Yesterday, @wsdxbz1 has expressed some concerns over the #LetsCyberConnect event, especially the way we distribute the POAPs. 

Openness is everything and we appreciate it. 

As the head of community of CyberConnect, I feel like I should say something.
