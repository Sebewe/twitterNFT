27,90% of projects literally rug these days it’s getting harder to spot no lie

64,@EastCoastNFT camol told me to write this
65,RT @flypueo: 100% this. If you feel FOMO and everyone and their mother is talking about it…you’re probably at or near the top.
66,"@SearchDecoder that’s what I was saying about it earlier, why not drop an additional NFT that you can sell, this one adds 0 value to me - holders aren’t being rewarded for it"
67,"from what ive learnt buying NFT’s, if you buy during the pump you’re more than likely buying the top"
68,"@SearchDecoder I think this is on the holder IMO, unless you can see two NFT’s why would you sell or before you do at least do some research into it - either way I’m not keen on the drop as you cannot sell it"
