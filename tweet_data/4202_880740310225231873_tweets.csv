1,"As both ICOs and stablecoin projects are expected to increase, it is very likely that the number of dual-token projects will continue to grow."
2,"However, the model is not limited to ICO-funded projects. The best-known example of a dual token model to create a non-volatile trading environment that has never conducted an ICO is @MakerDAO 's use of MKR and DAI."
3,"Thus, the value of the secondary token will most likely increase steadily as it operates on the deflationary principle of supply and demand."
4,"Most often, the relationship begins with an initial token that can be traded on coin exchanges. The secondary token, on the other hand, can only be acquired by exchanging the initial token into the secondary token."
5,"3- Non-ICO Dual Token Model

Another use case for introducing a dual token economy is to create a healthy, non-volatile trading environment by creating a relationship between two tokens in an ecosystem."
6,"Both tokens are treated separately, with no promotional mechanism in place to encourage potential investors with utility token offerings. 

This model is usually preferred when security tokens are issued first to raise and then utility tokens are issued when the project is ready"
7,"2- Detached ICO-Based Dual Token Model

In the detached ICO-based dual-token model, the utility token is not issued at the same time as the security token, so the utility token is not used as an incentive to purchase the security token."
8,"One advantage of the dual economic model is that it avoids the uncertainty.

As token sales occur over a period of years, one of the most important questions is whether token offerings are securities offerings within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws."
9,"1- Bundled ICO-Based Dual Token Model

Under the bundled format of the dual-token model, a blockchain project issues one token to secure funding from the public and a second token to be used on the network to perform certain activities that primarily serve utility purposes."
10,"The two-token economic model, is known for its methods of avoiding compliance issues, volatility, and splitting the project's ecosystem into two tokens for effective use.

Three formats of dual-token projects that fulfill the above purposes are as follows:"
11,"@Jad_AE and @skominers work is a masterpiece.

12,"Gitcoin grants:

A better version of Patreon, for developers.

The community decides on projects to support. These contributions are noticed by larger funding bodies (like the EF, ECF, etc.). Then, foundations can ‘top off’ contributions."
13,"Optimism’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding:

But unlike other public goods funding DAOs, the Results Oracle funds projects retroactively, rewarding projects that it recognizes as having already provided value."
14,"Optimism’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding:

A DAO, “the Results Oracle”, funds public good projects. Long term, the results oracle can be funded by protocol fees (eg. if implemented by an L2 project, sequencer auctions are one candidate). https://t.co/xmdnlPEN38"
15,"Intersubjective Consensus

Once Ethereum moves to Proof of Stake, base layer clients will power the network, preventing any fault in the network if one of the clients has a bug or a security hole.

@optimismPBC , @gitcoin grants: Pluralism of mechanism on public goods.

👇⌛️ https://t.co/dYz5Cw4hTR"
16,"Community members can create Gitcoin grants for public goods which are then eligible to receive CLR matching during each round. Organizations like the Ethereum Foundation (EF) and ConsenSys sponsor each round, providing the funds which are used to match donations."
17,“Individuals make public goods contributions to projects of value to them. The amount received by the project is (proportional to) the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received.”
18,"Gitcoin's crowdfund matching rounds, which utilizes a mechanism called Capital-constrained Liberal Radicalism, was created to help fund projects that support Ethereum R&amp;D as a public good."
19,"Solution: All public goods will use mechanisms that have been innovated in crypto.

Example: Gitcoin"
20,"Open-source software is a good example. It's more challenging to come up with the incentive signature. As a result, someone creates a software package that works halfway because it's closed source and has a business model."
21,"The underfunding of our digital infrastructure leads to these systemic imbalances between people who can create value and those who can capture value. 

This leads to a much more centralized ecosystem than it needs to be."
22,"Some projects are spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars on security, liquidity, mining but then a few million to pay for some research or development. 

When proper public goods are not funded, the market often provides centralized substitutes."
23,"What is QF?

Quadratic Funding is a mathematical approach to funding public goods that has the potential to amplify contributions from large groups of people over the contributions of individuals with deep pockets."
24,"@VitalikButerin was constantly talking about Quadratic Funding in the #ETHDenver.

Numerous things that are public goods get underfunded. 

Solution: Public goods will use mechanisms that have been innovated in crypto.
