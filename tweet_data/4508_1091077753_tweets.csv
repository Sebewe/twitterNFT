5,Everyone is so worried and jealous of what these guys have created. Why don't we do some math on how much the founders of @opensea have made? lets support web3. all of these weth rewards from @LooksRareNFT stakers are most likely going back into the nft economy. thats amazing!

49,@fungibles3 @LooksRareNFT You can have the same NFT listed on both OS &amp; Looks.
50,@dingalingts @LooksRareNFT @hildobby_ You guys should take rewards away from 0% creator projects. That would stop wash trading.
51,@JRNYcrypto Wolf game please
52,@fungibles3 @PonyoImpact Have you claimed yet? Is it worth claiming if your a looks holder?

60,@yeayea576 Epic! I was thinking it would be awesome to see a total eth market cap of all of the wolf game projects too. That way we can compare our project to the rest easier.

99,@beaniemaxi @beaniemaxi do you worry that having this game on eth will kill the project due to gas fees? It seems unfeasible with all of the gaming aspects. To have to pay gas for everything will kill the project in the long term.
