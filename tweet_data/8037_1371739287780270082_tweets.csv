53,@bitpixi Fucked up. The things they try to justify
54,"@SocratreesMusic @carolineradish @NFTSasha @winnynft When I make a joke about not having any Patience because she died, someone would be out of line to tell me to apologize for making the joke. They may not like my joke and they can certainly ask me not to make those jokes in front of them, but my healing isn't dictated by them."
55,"@SocratreesMusic @carolineradish @NFTSasha @winnynft If I have a loved one who died and you don't know them, and I make a joke about the death of my loved one, who are you to tell me not to joke about something that affected me more than it will ever affect you?"
56,"@SocratreesMusic @carolineradish @NFTSasha @winnynft We all have different ideas of what is ok to joke about. Individually and culturally and family, etc.

This is my basic rule:

If it is a joke about something that happened to you, and not to me, then who am I to tell you not to joke about it?"
57,"@SocratreesMusic @carolineradish @NFTSasha @winnynft NO. No it is not. Except in countries like Russia. Where joking can get you killed.

And a lot of people in Ukraine are not going to be okay. That is a fact. Not something we wish for. Because those who could stop Russia, won’t. Or haven’t."
58,"@SocratreesMusic @carolineradish @NFTSasha @winnynft That’s not what she’s saying. Sometimes we hear things people aren’t saying. It helps to ask for clarification before you let the fight take over. 
When humans have been through horrors, almost all would not wish those upon others-even their worst enemies"
59,@SocratreesMusic @carolineradish @NFTSasha @winnynft I’m not talking about Russia. I’m talking about you saying that Caroline wants to send people back to the place she escaped from
60,"@NFTSasha @carolineradish @winnynft Here's the thing, Sasha. As Americans, we suffered the fear of what horrors could happen to us.
Eastern Europeans suffered those horrors.
Yes, suffering on both sides.
But in comparison how can we say it is in any way equal? I would be ashamed to do so"
61,"@SocratreesMusic @carolineradish @NFTSasha @winnynft You are reaching so far here, I can hardly think you serious. What are you doing?"
62,"@SocratreesMusic @carolineradish @NFTSasha @winnynft Umm...your response to her sharing actual generational trauma caused by similar things to what you are worried MIGHT happen to your country is to say ""All of that still currently happens in Russia?"" You don't ask her anything, you show no care at all. 
Fuck, that's cold."
