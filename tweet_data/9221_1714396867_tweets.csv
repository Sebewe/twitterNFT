11,"@CryptoMento I mean they could but that would be like me punching Mike Tyson, the counter punch is going to be a bitch and might knock me out. Also a lot of G12 members went into those wars with the US."
12,@Doofy_eth I clicked that bell on your profile. I'd buy in just to have something fun to root for.
13,@floralfootball @BYOPills Have a feeling March will be huge! I'm ready to stake my stuff and see a real supply shock. Oh ya and some racing.
14,@Doofy_eth Anyone ever thought of starting a DAO to buy real life race horses. Could be interesting seems like you might be a guy with the know how to pull it off. I don't know anything about horses just talking out my ass btw.

39,Rogan hates Trump.
40,@SONOFJFK @PalmerReport @joerogan @Spotify He didn't get his podcast he created it. He was huge way before the Spotify deal. Easy don't like him don't listen.
41,"@PalmerReport ""Our side"", that is the problem now. If they fired him he would just go back to self publishing his podcast he had millions of daily downloads that way too. The guy gets more daily listens than all the news networks combined he is not going anywhere."
42,People are starting to notice @councilofkingz. Only a 185 listed and a burn happening in less than a month will reduce supply further. Think of it as a ETF for the metaverse.

45,Telling you all that had anything to do with those protest move the bulk of your money into crypto. Keep it in a self custody wallet not a exchange they are going to go after the exchanges too. If you are worried about volatility buy a stable coin like USDC.🙏 https://t.co/efPe52QfLZ
46,@OttawaPolice If you are concerned with crypto volatility put it in a stable coin like USDC.
47,@OttawaPolice If your a protester move all the money you don't immediately to crypto. Do not keep it on a exchange put it in a self custody wallet.

49,@eric_shipley @CueHealth Said the same thing to my wife last night.
50,@ilovelazylions @councilofkingz Long term play with a passive income potential. If in a year it is earning 1 million a month 1 king would pay you a $100 in eth straight to your wallet.

54,@Octopape @adamsmoot That is just how society seems to be now. Everything is spun to be sexist or racist. No offence meant.
55,@RektMoranis A real funny thing was our house was on the same farm a 100 yards away so we buried a cable to watch whatever they had on satellite. Problem was after 10pm grandpa might watch porn so we would turn on the TV and bam grandpa watching the spice channel. Never seen mom run that fast
56,@RektMoranis My grandparents had the big old satellite dishes and used bootleg codes to have every channel. She had every movie recorded on VHS. I joke she was the Piratebay of the 80's.

94,@bobvancecrypto I was just making a example. Changed my furnace out in 2019 too. Installed myself only paid a tech  to do the AC refrigeration lines since you have to be licenced to handle the refrigerant. Also did a tankless hot water heater at the sametime that is life changing!
95,@bobvancecrypto I need to start thinking of things in ETH. Like my HVAC guy fixed my furnace and it only cost me .3 ETH!
96,@BYOPills I would like to see some tier specific races. Not just ancients leveling up faster and voyagers having no chance at racing. Racing is fun if it is competitive no matter how fast it is. That is true in real life and in games
97,"@80strolls Stars no masks even when not performing, poor plebs setting up the halftime show wear masks. Becoming another way of showing a 2 tier society. It is science millionaires can't spread covid."
98,@joeymooose I'll admit I almost fell for it @joeymooose!
99,What I have learned from Superbowl commercials. Cameras are racist and everyone needs to buy a 300 dollar smart covid testing device. They are turning covid into to big business which means they will never let the fear mongering go away.
