10,"14- Next @theforge_land AMA tomorrow 8pm CET with @borgetsebastien, Co-Founder &amp; COO at @TheSandboxGame https://t.co/WfAvB5lfPV"
11,"13- To get started in DAOs, jump in on your own and be the first person to drive an initiative + read this by @chaserchapman

https://t.co/xlryrkmt2r"
12,"12- Advice when creating a DAO by @dabit3

Try to get the incentive mechanisms, Sybil resistance &amp; onboarding right upfront.

Once you have a community that is invested in making everyone around them successful, it seems to make everything else a lot easier."
13,"11- Biggest mistake by @dabit3

We are so early in how DAOs work. There is often not a right way or a wrong way to use as a precedent. Sometimes, we need to set our own precedent.

Make a decision &amp; roll with it. It's trial &amp; error. You are often in uncharted territory."
14,"10- @dabit3 also believes DAOs enable a disruptive incentive mechanism via tokenization.

We'll see more teams fundraise through new and innovative web3 models &amp; it will accelerate once a few teams realize how well it works."
15,"9- More generally, @dabit3 is bullish on infrastructure protocols like @ArweaveTeam, @graphprotocol, @ceramicnetwork, etc.. as they are primitive &amp; building blocks that the broader ecosystem is built upon."
16,"8- To solve this, we need to:

- Educate newcomers
- Build better products and UX on top of decentralized protocols
- &amp; even one step below that we need great DX: The best decentralized &amp; permissionless networks &amp; protocols that devs can use and build upon"
17,"7- Decentralized protocols are the reason for the space’s success.

Today, with the hype &amp; money that we're seeing now flowing into the space, there are a lot of teams &amp; projects coming in that don't value decentralization &amp; are just in it to make money."
18,"6- To find your DAO’s balance:

- Trial &amp; error
- Be as open as possible
- Share your mistakes &amp; learnings
- Have as many conversations out in the open as possible - you will be better off than if you decided not to as transparency makes the difference"
19,"5- DAOs are trying to solve a combination of some of the toughest problems that we've been dealing with for a long time.

Managing a DAO is about finding the right balance of moving quickly, enabling mechanisms around delegation &amp; trying to be as transparent as possible."
20,"4- The larger your community is, the harder it becomes to please everyone.

When you look at politics &amp; how hard it is to get people to align on decisions without causing polarization, you realize how tough this is."
21,"3- Today, @dabit3 is still involved, but he attributes @developer_dao’s success to the other members who’ve been doing most of the work.

He created it because he thought it would be an awesome place for him to hang out &amp; be a part of, but never wanted to have control over it."
22,"2- The opportunity for @developer_dao proposed itself when @lootproject was launched.

@dabit3 had a look at the smart contract, realizing how simple it was to fork &amp; create a token that may be compelling to devs. He threw out the idea &amp; they have essentially run with it."
23,"1- By participating in @FWBtweets, @dabit3 understood how attractive &amp; compelling the incentive mechanisms were in DAOs vs traditional community/company building.

There were not a lot of devs in there so he thought it’d be cool to have a community of devs building &amp; networking."
24,"0- Starting a DAO 101

80,"12- Top 3 advice by @followrene:

1. Work with people you trust and who share your values.
2. Start from the user. What problem are you looking to solve? Make sure you're excited to work on it for many years to come.
3. Don't spend too much time on Crypto @Twitter :)"
81,"11- Biggest mistake by @followrene:

They could have done a better job to articulate what @CeloOrg is &amp; how its blocks fit together.

Given their early use cases (payments, stablecoins), people think of Celo as a stablecoin project vs a fully EVM compatible L1 w/ unique features."
82,"10- The ecosystem has grown massively even just these past 3 months. There's a high degree of collaboration between ecosystem projects.

@cLabs was certainly instrumental in the early days &amp; has a lot of expertise to move Celo forward, but it's just 1 organization out of 1,000+."
83,"9- The internal structure at @CeloOrg maps the structure in the broader ecosystem: Smaller teams working together with a high degree of autonomy.

That's led to spin-outs like @ValoraApp."
84,"8- Educational content is also super important to make web3 more accessible. They have been doing some at @CeloOrg and it’s a big part of the 2022 priorities.

They like to partner and co-create, DM @followrene if interested :)"
85,"7- Accessibility is the core of Celo’s mission. Tools like @ValoraApp abstract complexity &amp; put the crypto stuff under the hood.

To get broader adoption, web3 products need to be as easy to use as web2 counterparts and ideally solve real-world problems."
86,"6- Celo just launched cREAL, a Brazilian Real-Pegged Stablecoin.

While @cLabs and @CeloOrg are involved in coordinating &amp; bringing ecosystem partners together, the cREAL launch goes through on-chain governance. It is purely driven by community/market demand."
87,"5- They have the most global user base among L1s (2.5M addresses) and key dApps like @ubeswap have most of their active users connecting through mobile devices.

They are also looking for ways to make DeFi more accessible with https://t.co/q5YsG4mUVL"
88,"4- It's been 4 years since @CeloOrg inception and we still, as a broader ecosystem, mostly interact with web3 via desktop.

Performance needs improvements, but with Plumo (https://t.co/FZt63JTEQe), Celo is leading the way."
89,"3- How would one operationalize a global UBI? How would one make remittances to remote communities cheaper? Why can't so many people get loans?

An infrastructure like @CeloOrg was necessary.

They wouldn't have a chance to solve this alone &amp; decided to build an open ecosystem."
90,"2- The MPV was to build an Ethereum wallet and take it to the real world, but:

- It wasn’t working on mobile phones (light client need)
- Payment complexity (gas in ETH vs stablecoins)
- Need for faster block times, lower fees &amp; carbon footprint (PoW vs PoS)"
91,"1- The @CeloOrg story started in 2017.

@marek_, @followrene &amp; Sep Kamvar were excited about Ethereum and the potential to bring basic financial tools and services to more people around the world, starting with payments."
92,"0- How to build an L1 &amp; an entire mobile ecosystem to tackle real-world issues with blockchain technology?
