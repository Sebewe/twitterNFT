16,@Eduardo00386934 @cryptob3nz @doodledogsnft @garyvee Doodle Dogs could literally go to 0 and I would be just as happy to own the 10 that I have. I think they are cute and just being able to use them as my identity and utilize them for future endeavors both dog related and not is enough for me. I buy art not investments.
17,"@Eduardo00386934 @cryptob3nz @doodledogsnft @garyvee The issue is your version of objectivity is simply wrong. 

You’re not into the more laid back art style of the doggos, that’s fair. I am. That’s also fair.

You’re just slinging opinions, then trying to sell them as facts and objective logic. We all just have different taste!"
