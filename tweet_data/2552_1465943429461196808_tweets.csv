24,"@LarrotizPablo @juiceboxETH That's interesting, on one hand you don't want whales taking full control of a DAO, but on the other hand, you want people to invest heavily with conviction. Is there a middle ground where anyone can only invest up to 4x? of the min buy in? What do you think about that?"
25,@LarrotizPablo You don’t believe in weighted shares?

73,"Damn, accidentally offended someone at a party by calling wolf game a ponzi 😅"
74,"Instead of traditional
“fund raise -&gt; create  -&gt; publish” 
we let creators 
“publish -&gt; fundraise -&gt; create” with their audience involved in more iterative steps"
75,"We're not sure how this model will eventually play out, but with the right incentive design/game theory/skin in the game by all parties, we think more creators will be empowered to bootstrap/fund raise for their films and enjoy a more involved/fun creative process."
76,"So in summary, Shibuya = decentralized Netflix. Watch for free, pay to support any film and become a producer, and also own the final product with the community of producers. Imagine deciding who dies in squid game and see your name in credits while earning royalties from it"
77,@PANewsCN @maciej_kuciara @metag33 @reichertjalex Lol @AlyssaTsai did you just screenshot my IG story 🤣🤣🤣
78,"On the flip side as shibuya could allow creators to fundraise for their project with their community as it goes, films that lose support could end up not getting minted out for the next EP and end. Everyone has skin in the game to help make the best show experience possible"
79,"These tokens then becomes membership to the community that not only helped shape the plot but also owns the finished film together, imagine owning $sgame tokens from EP1 before it blew up. And guess what would happen if film were to be acquired? Idk but these tokens prob 🚀🌕"
80,"Simply put, voting early and lose is more rewarding than voting late on the popular side"
81,"(3/x) to make this even more web3, as “producers” vote, they are rewarded tokens specific to the show, let’s say $SGame tokens here, these represents the final fractionalized ownership of the finished film, bonding algo are also in place to incentivize early/winning voting"
82,"(2/x) if majority ppl voted for flying to see his daughter, film creators will make the plot for next episode to go that way, in that sense, every participant becomes an active “producer” not just a “viewer” and the community helps the creator decides what happens"
83,"(1/x) Imagine watching Squid Game, at the end when he is presented with the choice of rejoining the game vs flying to his daughter - because you like the show so much and want to support it, you can buy/mint these producer pass NFTs, and stake these to vote a certain direction."
