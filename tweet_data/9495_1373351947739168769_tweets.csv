66,@Darren33696019 @XpansionPhunks @ExpansionPunks If you have an #xPunk you should check to see if you can pick up your counterpart while it’s still relatively inexpensive.
67,@naturesdoteth @ExpansionPunks @FlorianUhde @larvalabs @NotLarvaLabs @XpansionPhunks Idk. They’ve been pretty responsive. The moderator running the twitter probably isn’t a dev. I support both projects. Just happens to be that I align myself more so with the #Phunks than #Punks. Although I do like the inclusivity of #xPunks so I support all three.
