4,@netanel83 The special 1/1 edition for charitable causes is the exception. I don't think the entire floor will be 20 ETH range because of that off the bat but we'll see very soon!
5,@Giwaw7789 right click save
6,@0xAnonym @InvsbleFriends @opensea hopefully some spent on security and overall support 👀
7,@netanel83 hoping something reasonable around 1-2 ETH to sweep floor quickly. Gold edition auction is setting bar VERY high though

They knew their high mint would be well justified in the near future... I didn't agree with mint process either but happy I was able to mint one"
11,"@renegademasterr @BoredApeYC @punkscomic @coolcatsnft @GutterCatGang @RumbleKongs @jenkinsthevalet @Deadfellaz @ThePixelmon Curious your take on @RTFKTstudios mint/auction? Different case here, they are an established brand, with meaningful utility + collaborative partnerships which speak for themselves. 

Ultimately the market determines if mint prices were appropriate or not...
