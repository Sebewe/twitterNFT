18,@domain Thank you for pushing .IO to new highs.
19,"@TheWebBrokers1 @kwkuh @soy_eth @enstools Also you can combine those word lists together and with other filters, for example to find all Available or For Sale masculine names under 5 chars. Then sort by price and look for steals."
20,"@TheWebBrokers1 @kwkuh @soy_eth @enstools You can use the word lists to filter OpenSea listings to find deals, not just available names. Also, the word lists are much more extensive than the few thousand presented there: 100k first/last names, 400k dictionary words, and the top 1 million domains from Alexa/Majestic."
21,@mickhagen @0xAnav so you don't pay tithing?
22,"@mickhagen @0xAnav Not hate speech. You choose to adhere to some 1800's bible fan fiction. Brantly prefers the original medieval flavor. You financially support an institution that actively harms young gay members to the point of suicide. Keep telling everybody that you're the victim, hypocrite."
23,"@mickhagen @0xAnav Nobody is trying to cancel your wet paper towel ass. I've watched Brantley for years and he could certainly be abrasive &amp; stubbornly contrarian, but I respected him. Maybe you two can teach me the secret to being kind to other humans while also believing they are inherently evil."
24,"@mickhagen @0xAnav This is you, this entire thread: ""This Brantley situation is coming uncomfortably close to making me think critically about my own Church's shitty beliefs, and that sounds hard and scary.

44,"@ppcbz @enstools normalization is the standard spec set by ENS that works everywhere. it is possible to register unnormalized names, for example names with capital letters, by interacting directly with contract. but reg/buying those names is a waste of money since they won't work as expected."
45,"@ppcbz @enstools click on the name, takes you to https://t.co/412YJsCmC9 to register. (or go there and enter the name). but beware, all domains now have an expensive premium for 30 days after expiration. starts at 100k and drops to 0"

57,"@MAB if anything the starting price for 3Ls and 4Ls should be increased. the reason you can register any of them right now is only because they are $600, and it increasingly looks like a pretty solid bet to scoop them up at that price. in the .COM world, 3L and 4L are the most liquid"

65,@nicksdjohnson @jake_spitty @rob_mose @ensdomains @enstools @BrantlyMillegan There are already multiple whales with 10k+ ENS names. The fact that only 12 sniped names were already RESOLD during this time period is practically irrelevant. The ACOOOMulation is well underway.
66,"@nicksdjohnson To improve liquidity it would be super neat if ENS protocol had a native offer/bid interface. Not sure about feasibility, but if I could lock up a bid for a name for X days, owners/squatters could monitor these and we’d have decentralized trading."
67,"@nicksdjohnson Seems like an english auction might be best/(only?) way to ensure non-flashbots users can 100% secure their domain, and likely at a cheaper price on average."
68,"@nicksdjohnson Users get a raw deal when their budget is revealed and they lose out on the name anyway. With names appreciating over time, squatters know today’s market price may still be a good investment."
69,@nicksdjohnson I would tune it to only attempt this for generic names of my choosing and only within a certain price range I’m comfortable paying. The upside is with this method I may pay even less than I was willing to for a domain I considered valuable.
70,"@nicksdjohnson I think there is still a sniping/frontrunning opportunity: my bot commits to every domain of potential value/resale, and then waits with flashbots to outrun the first register() call. I get the domain for the price someone wanted to pay and then extract more from them."
71,"@t3rtium @nicksdjohnson you don’t need a bot to do that, and the price worth paying is speculative"
72,@mrdavediamond @0xAPEFATHER looks familiar
73,@BrantlyMillegan @nicksdjohnson @spencecoin they do tons of paid advertising. I don’t think people know what they are buying and are attracted to the more nondenominational extensions like .nft and .crypto

83,@AlanaDLevin @BrantlyMillegan these people have registered their .ETH domains for over 1000 years. @ShytoshiKusama’s expires in the year 4271 AD and anyone can extend it in the meantime. I would call that ownership. https://t.co/1aB18VUSzM
84,@bylking7 @AlanaDLevin @HNS HNS has renewal fee too.
85,"@sohrab @garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @smith77778 @MAB @serenae_fansubs @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains okay, I agree, english auctions would probably be best for end users. last time ENS used OpenSea to auction the short names. They may have more important work than the ideal auction UI for expiring names. But it would bring in $$ for the DAO that is now going to snipers."
86,"@nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @garypalmerjr @smith77778 @MAB @serenae_fansubs @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains Sniping is small scale now, but the reward is already so high that all valuable names from here on out will go to snipers paying the premium without end users getting a chance. pop.eth got sniped and resold for 10 eth. maybe the end user gets it for 3E with higher premium?"
87,"@garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @smith77778 @MAB @serenae_fansubs @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains If you think it sucks now to overpay a little for a domain you really want, wait until you are in a never ending 24/7 bidding war against a bot that requires you to pay gas for each bid. It happens already in the domain industry on GoDaddy auctions."
88,"@garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @smith77778 @MAB @serenae_fansubs @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains Sure, it may realize some cheaper prices for end users if done correctly. It does open a lot more doors for bots though. Bots are gonna bid up every domain that gets a bid. They are gonna extend every auction for weeks using the minimum bid increase at the last possible second."
89,@BrantIyMillegan report this scammer “BRANTiY”
90,"@garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @ForSureNotHere @smith77778 @MAB @serenae_fansubs @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains The dutch auction captures exact market value, but I agree that putting every expiring name up for english auction does as well, except it requires a MUCH more complex UI. Think outbid notifications, extending auctions for last second bids, minimum bid increase, etc. etc."
91,@ForSureNotHere @garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @smith77778 @MAB @serenae_fansubs @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains Increasing the fee to say 100 eth is the only way to even the playing field. It will eliminate automated mass sniping and make drop catching a much tougher arb opportunity. Better that @ensdomains captures the value of these “auctions” than 3rd party middlemen w/flashbots.
92,"@ForSureNotHere @garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @smith77778 @MAB @serenae_fansubs @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains DNS drop catching makes millions for these middleman cabals (DropCatch .com, etc.) and end users have zero chance. Even reputable registrars dip in for “Backorder” fees for domains nobody wants. ENS sniping will only increase and $2k is a very obvious gamble right now."
93,"@ForSureNotHere @garypalmerjr @nicksdjohnson @smith77778 @MAB @serenae_fansubs @BrantlyMillegan @ensdomains Raising the fee is the ONLY solution. The sniping is only getting started. In the DNS world, drop catching is effectively a gas war where the gas is multiple expensive ICANN Registrar entities. The result is that nearly every $8 .COM is sniped and auctioned to the highest bidder."
94,@hnsfund things HNS is good at:
95,"@adraffy @unicode A small plus sign ""+"" would have made a lot more sense."
96,"@nicksdjohnson @BrantlyMillegan @Uniregistry @ICANN Kind of neat that @ensdomains are holding up millions of dollars of deals in the ""real"" world though. It's not helping anybody's opinion of ICANN."
97,"@nicksdjohnson @BrantlyMillegan @Uniregistry Interesting, so they didn't claim ownership, just created these NFTs for the sale? Sounds like @ICANN wants to own these NFTs, and extend their ownership of DNS TLDs to ENS. Can you point me to one of the NFTs in question?"
98,"@internetdomains no, $5 to register the domain per year (depending on length), and you can register it for 1000 years to save on gas."
99,".@nicksdjohnson @BrantlyMillegan What IS the process for claiming a DNS TLD on ENS? Can it be automated? In the event of a sale, can a new registrar contract be issued, or only existing key transferred? Did @Uniregistry even setup anything for .hiphop?
