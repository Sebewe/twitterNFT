I don't own any wunks btw, just a thought."
80,"@PopeyesNFTs In tech we talk about the idea of products vs platforms, with a platform being some tool that allows customers to build their own solutions (AWS is a prime example). We have yet to see anyone adopt this methodology for an NFT project. Even the NFT tools are all still products."

Time to find the solid projects that get undercut in this time and stock up"
94,"@TheShamdoo True this is definitely not your fault bro. 

Devs fumbled the bag on many levels you could never know about unless you were actually a member of the team."
95,"@BentoBoiNFT @HungerBrainz Yeah disappointing for real. Even if they post a good announcement explaining it, I am doubting the quality of their devs at their point.

Clearly didn't do sufficient rollout testing for their contract and infra"
96,"- Lack of communication from the team
- Once site went live, whitelist error prevented anyone from minting

This doesn't inspire confidence in a project trying to deliver a P2E game. Might still flip it if devs post an announcement addressing these issues. Not holding though."
97,"(1/2)
Was going to mint @HungerBrainz NFT but I am not planning on it anymore after observing the following:
- Delayed mint and missed the delayed deadline
- Additional route in sitemap revealed they stole code from Bear Game
- Mods deleting comments, banning people for mention"
98,@PopeyesNFTs Gonna take my eyes some time to get used to this
99,@BentoBoiNFT It’s okay mfers like me ain’t qualify for the airdrop in the first place
