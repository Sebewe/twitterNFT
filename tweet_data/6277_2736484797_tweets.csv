56,@DopplerJess There’s so much unnecessary toxicity not just in chasing but in everything and it’s super bothersome seeing it happen. Can’t imagine what you have to go through just to enjoy life. Very sorry for this
57,@wxmann Gives me a drive to double down. This May is going to be make or break
58,@StasIsChasing I was a nobody last year and now it seems I’m doing better promoting my brand. I’ve got the drive to succeed and come out on top. I’m young but others will know me in the future. Hard work is coming this May
59,@jengrand8 Thank you! It’s 1 year of plains/monsoon chasing! I love my work and I shouldn’t dwell in the negativity. May is going to be a huge month for me and they’ll take notice. Going from a nobody to a somebody in a year is better than I expected. #NeverStopChasing
60,"@GinjaNinjaPhoto Sorry you didn’t get to speak in that. Thank you so much for your words and I’ll never stop chasing. It’s a huge part of me. I want to have success so I’m doing what I can to go up. Haters can’t stop me, just gives me an extra boost"
61,@shotbyspencer I was a nobody a year ago and now I have some pros knowing my work. I guess I’m building a brand better than I expected. Just need that consistency this year!

67,"@KJPelegreenNFT @lorigraceaz From my experience, this is the unfortunate truth. Especially in the chasing community"
68,@lorigraceaz I was a no name last year and now I have some pros mentioning me out of the blue. I guess I’m doing a great job getting my name out there. This year I’m going all out again to prove them wrong! F the haters
69,@Cassi_Moghan I have my people and I love what I do. Hurts that it’s a group of chasers I look up to but now I need to prove them wrong again. Thank you for your words!
70,"@jmorgan_wx It’s annoying to see others say they want more people to chase, to go along with their dreams and then attack those building. Time to prove them!"
71,@JustinDeLand2 I do my work for me and I love it a lot. Haters hurt but I still plan to chase storms. Only now I have a stronger mission. Thank you for your words!

93,"If you get anything out of this, just be kind."
94,"I’ll find it and it’ll kill my motivation. I have no irl person to  discuss this with so no matter how hard i try, it gets to my head. It makes me want to give up because I’m not worthy. Just don’t say it."
95,"Can’t we all just show some respect. Don’t we learn about respect in kindergarten? Don’t we learn to keep things to yourself if they aren’t good to say, if they’re hurtful? If you want to be an ass don’t put it on the internet because it never leaves."
96,"Just a boost of encouragement goes a long way. I look up to people. I aspire to get shots like many people. When someone you admire and look up to you is out there making fun of what you love and what you’re proud of, it hurts. It makes me angry."
97,"Me. Of all people. I was a nobody last year. You’ve heard of me now because I put in the work to grow. I went all out to build a brand. I went all out to build my name. Ive worked hard to get where I am. Yall were in my shoes too. Instead of being an ass, maybe you should support"
98,"I cannot get a job. I go to class, do homework and have practice. I get a little bit of free time a day. None of it pays. NFTs have helped me cover basic necessities along with a fund to chase storms. I work hard for a bunch of people to just sit there and laugh at me"
99,To those people (you absolutely know who you are) are doing a disservice to the future of storm chasing. Why? You’re actively trying to put young chasers down for trying to pursue a dream. Chasing is not cheap.
