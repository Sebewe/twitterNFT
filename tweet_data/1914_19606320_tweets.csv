55,"@VinciQuinci @sendmewagmi @baba_crypt @0xngmi I think what @VinciQuinci is pointing out is that there are very few of these kinds of bets, and most people LP-ing would make way more by just holding assets they believe in."
56,"@VinciQuinci @sendmewagmi @baba_crypt @0xngmi Haha I didn't mean to spark this convo, but just like most of DeFi, if you make a good bet, you can make a good ROI.

If you're LP-ing high volume projects that are stable in price, you're going to make money."

58,@austingriffith @pedrouid @BrantlyMillegan Interesting. Are ethers/web3/etc. validating address ownership from wallet providers? Or can this technically be a feature add to a wallet? I might play with that next week a bit.
59,@VinciQuinci @0xngmi If it all goes to zero we all ngmi so that problem fixes itself haha
60,"@jongold so, see u in two weeks? 🤣"
61,@dabit3 multiple unsaved changes failing tests counters sticky going back to bed 🤣
62,@0xngmi Love ya this. You should put the 1 ETH in a yield farm that anyone who found you gets a rewards stream from as long as you're anon. That adds an incentive for them to keep the information private.
63,"@drewcoffman @Dezachu @redcar_tenken @geometric I'd love to share a ""what Drew sees"" NFT guide with so many people, does this exist yet?

A lot of people are only exposed to the pyramid scheme area of things and don't know how to navigate to the center."

71,"@cyanhex @0xKaty Web3 can objectively make the world a better place, as a whole (unless someone wants to argue that &lt;1% of humans enslaving the rest is a ""good"" thing).

85,"@italobb @VitalikButerin @ensdomains @proofofhumanity @poapxyz @vitalik @provenauthority @lvlprotocol We're actually really close with ipfs off-chain rollups, but might benefit from specifically supporting verifiable claims schemas to the data rollups."
86,"@italobb @VitalikButerin @ensdomains @proofofhumanity @poapxyz @vitalik I think there's something here around attestations, and needing more of a rollup of attestations on-chain (only). @provenauthority was pulling my thoughts in that direction last month.

I think we can take a turn on @lvlprotocol with this idea."
