71,"Plot twist: what if @thefuckintrolls was the most genius rug ever. Think about it, they came with the concept of no roadmap, no discord, the just had to maintain an active twitter account that trolled people. And we’re are like “they so funny” 😅"

90,Having normal NFTs is boring. Having @CBCreepz is fun. You get to strategize every day and watch the community go crazy in the discord.
91,@tokenoncrypto @CBCreepz It’s very interesting. The execution is so well done.
92,"@troyX_eth @CBCreepz It’s interesting how it plays out, I think that if the price of loomi goes up, it won’t be a problem on reducing yield. I was more worried that once you have nothing to buy price of loomi goes down, but doesn’t seem to be the case, people don’t mind holding apparently."
