25,"@JWeb777 IF had a mint of .25, pre-reveal floor was 9eth as the previous projects in the RCC that ensured WL was 3 eth at peak. Projects don’t set secondary floor prices, the market does.

68,"@x_wx_x @mmascara15 That’s a different question than making the claim that the project is unproven. If you don’t want to buy then don’t buy, enough people do that and the price will go down. The artists behind the collective and this collection specifically are more than proven lol"
69,"Fudding @InvsbleFriends because you think the pre-reveal price is too much is crazy. 

The market dictates prices so I understand the disappointment of not being able to mint/getting priced out of the collection but to attack the validity of is nonsense"
70,@mmascara15 @x_wx_x I’m not tweeting fud about a project I don’t know about and am salty I didn’t mint/wasn’t able to buy into on secondary 🤣😂
71,"@mmascara15 @x_wx_x They’re not from the same artist, it’s a collective. You can access their discord and read the roadmap. The space is full of flippers, that’s not new. The “flipability” of a project is not an indication of whether or not they’re proven"
72,"@x_wx_x @mmascara15 Yes this is how snapshots affect floor prices of collections, what is your point? That they’re unproven because people speculated on their collection? Lmao"
73,"@mmascara15 @x_wx_x You’re right floor prices don’t prove worth, there’s countless examples of that in this space. They’ve been building for months and the market is setting the price of the floor. Original mint prices of slim hoods and rollers was less than .1, the market sets the rest"
74,"@x_wx_x @mmascara15 “Untested collection”

Look up slim hoods and mood rollers before loading up your fud cannon my guy"
75,@ZachRosas2 You’re absolutely right in that as well as a moment against the jags will prolly be worth less lmao
