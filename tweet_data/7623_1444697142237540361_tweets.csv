4,@ianmichelangelo Shopify feature is in the backlog :)
5,@ianmichelangelo Good question! So the its designed to partner any e-commerce store with nft communities. Say you sell llama earrings and you want to offer a special 10% discount to a specific nft community that donates from their treasury to a llama non-profit. This provides that nft check.

13,"and with Women’s History month in a few hours East Coast time, I’m hoping to learn more and contribute to my little girls future 👨‍👧"
14,"trying to be a good #girldad here. I’m building up a little collection for my 2 year old to have when she’s older. So far it’s:

@YearoftheWoman_ WL 

Hopefully can add more as I build my portfolio. Any I’m missing?"

17,@tentaclepapi ngl I’ve thought about this too!
18,Which would you rather have:
19,"RT @sartoshi_nft: if u want to create, create
if u want to buy, buy
if u want to sell, sell
if u want others to do only what u want them to…"
20,gm folks. What are we building today? 🛠

40,@MaxEth7 @Ewani @joshbobrowsky @RNDMCHARACTERS Appreciate the discussion!
41,@zhoug0x rip this space 2022-2022
42,@zhoug0x current map of roads for those confused: https://t.co/qMPoqcFSG1
43,"@MaxEth7 @Ewani @joshbobrowsky @RNDMCHARACTERS Then I used the wrong terminology. Instead of roadmap, it’s an nft blueprint recipe that is ctrl c/v everywhere. What’s the difference between cereal club, IF, squiggles, etc. they all follow that blueprint for “success” which you’re not calling a roadmap."
44,"@MaxEth7 @Ewani @joshbobrowsky @RNDMCHARACTERS This is literally what I mean by a roadmap:

- big names thrown around
- industry standard art
- building trust through follower count
- donation to some charity
- 1:1 auction 
- influencers"
45,@DataNFT_ Oculus owner. Pretty dope. Make a fake fb account and then you don’t need to link it.
46,"@daboigbae @Coinbase_NFT I wish Coinbase history played a part in waitlist spot. 

11/30/2017 was my first purchase through them :("
47,@Ewani @joshbobrowsky marketing. It’s a ctrl c/v roadmap. You could probably raise $50k on this “recipe for nft success” with historical performance and just print money.
48,@MfersAhead @NFTDukes @DJ_Alias_ @gcah18 @dogara2022 @GoldSunDragon @BlakeDonovan15 @mc_travor @eastwindwalker @mfreeman1788 @coffeebrewzer not a winner but this project and community interaction is the definition of being a mfer 🤙

93,"mfers, I fear for those that have anything listed from 6- 6.89. It’s gonna be a literal rocket ship to 6.9."
94,"@kapstone I think that’s also why mfers is taking off. No expectations, no pressure to deliver, let the community run with it and let the project define its own path."
95,@kapstone that’s a good point. I’m also truly curious. I think we see the success of brand and partnerships with established entities like Adidas and Nike and want to attribute that path of success to small unknown teams and projects.
96,@kapstone why should deadfellaz or robotics have a higher floor than mfers? Why should any pfp be higher than any other pfp?
97,"@Giddyupyours seriously, you have the best advanced analytics on this bird app."
98,@CryptoPapi10 @coolcatsnft Absolutely - always trying to push web3 capabilities forward. Give me about a week and l’ll ping you again to find 20 min for a zoom demo. 🤝
99,@CryptoPapi10 @coolcatsnft I disagree. Currently working on building my startup that aims to solve this problem. I’ve got a working prototype. Finalizing a few items then launching. Would be happy to show you.
