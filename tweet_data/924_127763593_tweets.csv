hopefully the buyers are reimbursed in whatever way possible!"
24,"@jstn completely agree. &amp; if i were the founder, suddenly receiving 70+ mil would probably be pretty overwhelming knowing that you now have to deliver a project of that worth. almost no way to make everyone happy in the small time frame they set for themselves. doomed from the start!"

on one hand, i think you’re correct in it being healthy. projects will have a chance to reestablish from the floor up.

on the other hand, i’m wondering if projects that don’t have as active communities will simply die off?

time will tell!"
79,the great os reset will tell all
80,surprised projects haven’t started tweeting abt how their community members should relist projects if they choose not to migrate before expiration. seems like something we should be discussing more!
