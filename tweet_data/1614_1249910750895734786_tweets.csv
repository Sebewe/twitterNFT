38,@rhizomics how is it designed to deceive or defraud?

49,@thetoyinventor @imrobertmine @illustramanda @nanaths @NFTCryptoChicks being inspired by someone’s work and copying someone’s work are two different things
50,@thetoyinventor @imrobertmine @illustramanda @nanaths @NFTCryptoChicks just a heads up that polly stated she stole from multiple artists. more digging needs to be done in regards to the other traits.
51,i just want to get WL without grinding for WL

55,"@ThebuddhaTh @Sugarluxe @illustramanda lol no she didn’t, it was in portuguese. i’m assuming you read someone else’s interpretation of what she was saying."
56,@LivingPixelated @NFTCryptoChicks ahhh :( well to be fair no one had any idea of what the artist did.
57,@ThebuddhaTh @Sugarluxe @illustramanda please DYOR before making these claims against the artist. the art is on other sites with other stolen art. she’s clearly the original artist https://t.co/YqVIgNV6Aj
58,@ThebuddhaTh @Sugarluxe @illustramanda the stock sites are not “dated” and the redbubble site stole from her
59,"@jcreed06 @harshilv8 @studiojkt1 @DJMoonNFT @ferreirovisq @NFTCryptoChicks @illustramanda it is legit, she posted it on her insta"

61,@illustramanda compensate her now @NFTCryptoChicks
62,@Nachtw0lf @NFTCryptoChicks their response was awful
63,"@GuyImprov @NFTCryptoChicks how is it solid? they are stating it’s a stock photo (it’s not, someone else clearly stole amanda’s art), and that it was only #2 when it’s literally the base for multiple pieces of art in the collection. they need to reach out to @illustramanda"
64,still no response from @NFTCryptoChicks on how they are going to compensate the woman that their artist stole from. crazy https://t.co/6kvhdqZ1bp
