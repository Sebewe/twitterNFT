7,@havas_eth No way forward. Russia might win or lose to the EU. But Ukraine won't win alone. Government has given up their independence to the EU

19,@Eljaboom I'm bullish on the $DVDX's #binaryoptions 2.0 that is set to release soon and will cover other events outside #crypto
20,@CryptoGemsCom I'd put half into $DVDX so i can earn 3x on leverage mint for stablecoins and the rest into building my #nft portfolio.
21,@cryptoworld202 $SPOOL imo is! Because of their ability to allow users to earn passively by allowing them to choose the APY for their stablecoins.
22,@Adams_cyripto @AltCryptoGems @SpoolFi Don't forget that $SPOOL gives you the right to decide on how much you wish to earn passively with your #stablecoins by setting the APY of your choice.

64,@Cryptoking Yes
65,@cryptoworld202 If $DVDX delivers on their Roadmap and releases their platform with multiple listings of tokenized stocks and #cryptos then expect a huge influx of liquidity.
66,"@cryptoworld202 I can't honestly pick one, but i can pick one that will offer multiple other #Cryptos from $DVDX through stablecoin launch and hybrid tokens."

78,@TheMoonCarl I'll be getting $DVDX and with that I'll be getting $USDx followed by hybrid tokens. So I'll be getting 3 different investments from one #altcoin.
79,"@MajesticDrama You got your investment mixed into different classes, good move 💯. Consider investing in $DVDX that's targeting traditional institutions with their decentralized #derivatives usecases. A new class of investment."
