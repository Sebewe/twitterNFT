28,Kevin is the Baby Yoda of web3
29,"@0xKNNY Well its not an airdrop for sure.
That i do know, but it makes it even more confusing, all the tweets are talking about some sort of $70mil donation(?) fundraiser(?) something with lots of complicated stuff and graphs in it.
Looks like some dev exclusive lore tbh"
30,"@photoNft65 You go to opensea, cancel the listings you have and revaluate your jpegs, probably relisting them at a higher price."
31,"@photoNft65 Yes.
Delist them"
32,DON’T LET OLIGARCHS STEAL YOUR JPEGS!

I just wanna know wtf this screenshot is about https://t.co/0QVkFJouPE"
50,"@trainticketsplz 2274631718% agreed
mfers are one of the best projects ive ever seen, the art is global, relatable and yet unique and individually identifiable which is huge, Sartoshi’s existence and humor alone is the best roadmap anyone could ask for.
Theyre also CC0 so the mferverse only grows"

We love to see it"
59,@roughsparks @farokh @wokkrr @iwwon_official @sabet Bold of him to do such a thing when his entire current project is basically an Xcopy rip off lmao.
60,"RT @0xKNNY: 888 items, this is the market you're looking at, that's it, those are the listings @BoredPunkYC https://t.co/aGWVOjzs49"
61,@apenimeNFT Yeah ok this looks kinda lit
62,"@LooksRareNFT It’d be great to have a robust sub grouping model for AB Collections (like OS) Also it’d be cool to have the same model for manifold contracts for artists, as they act as parent contracts potentially hosting many sub collections. OS doesn’t have this yet and shows them as traits."

74,"@economist @AB84 Also i’d like to point out that not only  @BoredPunkYC already exists, since June 2021.
But It has the first and perhaps only on chain royalty sharing system hardcoded in its smart contract (written by the one and only @0xfoobar)
Oh and it has a much limited supply of 888 Tokens."
75,"Yes… permissionless censorship resistant systems are cool, but are they nuclear warfare resistant?

stay tuned"
76,"@mondoir This is turning into some آرش کمان‌گیر kind of story bruh… at this rate it seems like you’re going to put your life and sanity on the line to get the show up &amp; running and im afraid that you might not even get there to see it yourself.

87,"So @Ukraine the country has an official Twitter account, people from all over the world are helping them by sending crypto,
Yesterday @andrwwang &amp; his team raised a million dollars for them in just 30 seconds with NFTs.
This is what we mean by “crypto/NFTs will change the world”"
88,"@LooksRareNFT Make an app,
An app that actually allows trading,
Give substantially more rewards to those who use it instead of the web version (or make it have less fees, like 1%)
Enjoy your reign

Also allow using $looks for trades, with zero fees as incentive."

96,"Maybe just stop doing randomized unrevealed drops across the board(?)
Just go back to the fully revealed and hand picked first come first served tradition of Punks,
Yeah… rarer items would probably cost a bit of blood, but overall i think it’ll be worth it."
