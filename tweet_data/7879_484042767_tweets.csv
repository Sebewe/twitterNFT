73,"@FataniOsman @CritterzNFT Apologies I missed this Osman.

I wouldn't compare the projects as they are very different (see tweet below).

It all depends on your objectives (e.g. NFTW will likely attract more NFT investors).

Both seem to have strong teams and communities.

74,"This graphic gives perspective on the evolution of the metaverse.

Interesting to see Microsoft on the timeline twice.

And of course, Minecraft, which is now even more important given @nftworldsNFT. Fyi, it was launched in May 2009. https://t.co/8r6NGlv6pp"
75,"@top_eth Hard to compare as they are different projects

NFTW - you buy the land &amp; build it (DIY or with an experienced builder) and make it available for play, OR simply rent it out to others to build out

C - you buy the avatar, play the game, earn BLOCK, buy land &amp; build on it yourself"
