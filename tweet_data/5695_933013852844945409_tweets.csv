50,"By allowing the developer to provide their own implementation Solmate doesn't need to include the String library or unnecessary functions. This is very appreciated by those of us that like on-chain data URIs.

4b https://t.co/DSbt6Kx9IY"
52,"4) Opinions About Token URI
@OpenZeppelin makes assumptions about the structure of a token's URI.

First, an internal function to returns a base URI. This can be overridden in the child contract.

53,"Solmate makes the mapping public to satisfy the same interface. This means an extra view function isn't necessary.
3b https://t.co/c2NHDni4wr"
54,"3) Unnecessary Private Mappings

IERC721 defines a public balanceOf function. @OpenZeppelin satisfies this implementation by keeping a private mapping of balances and a read function to access that mapping.

55,"Solmate ERC721 reduces deployment cost.

How?

By removing:

1) Transfer hooks (get fucked enumerable)
2) Address
3) Unnecessary private mappings
4) Opinions about the token URI
