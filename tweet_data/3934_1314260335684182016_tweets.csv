1) I added some pectinase to some mandarins. This breaks down the pectin so you're just left with pure fruit

60,"I am confident that @KennethCassel will continue to execute on this project, so if you know some web dev and want to take a plunge into web3, please check it out!"
61,"The newest tutorial just launched last week and it asks you to make an NFT loot box on Polygon. This will be an interesting challenge since I haven't interacted with it much. You can also earn a couple $MATIC to sweeten the deal.

62,"I did like that the team was updating the course as people completed (common bugs were sorted out before I got to the section). Looking back, I see they even added a TOS which is awesome. It was also nice to have other Windows users in the discord to help me out. 😅"
63,This tutorial took me longer than I want to admit - part being that I hadn't brushed up on my JS in a while and I didn't know how the course was laid out. I think the team can do a better job at laying out what skills you need before jumping in.
64,"I learned that since blockchains are immutable (changes can't be overwritten), you have to move all your scripts to a new smart contract once you make a change. I saw a post by @iam_preethi that covers this idea in more detail.
