70,@andrealtrez @NFTherder @WeatheReportNFT This is a serious offence. These founders are asking us to make them rich by minting and supporting their project. I know that Web3 is the Wild West but Zach and Will and to a lesser extent Toby are the face of a multi million dollar corporation and brand. Not okay at all.
71,This situation is already a sordid mess but this item should not go overlooked. Struggling to parse my feelings over this since all the fallout began. Suffice it to say this behaviour from the founders is a massive disappointment. https://t.co/KfHWsv2fBO
72,This project is indeed different. Projects like these are a game changer in the Web3 space. If you don't know about @PassTheBaton check them out! https://t.co/xhyyFtrF4p

87,"@Carlini8N @PurrnelopesCC The most significant evolution for me - and zero shade to those projects not about this - is the movement of NFTs for social good/change/awareness (environmental incl.). It teaches us, and more importantly those outside the space the true potential of NFTs."

90,@andytreys_ @NFTethics @KB24NFT With once a month additions of channels and !vibe checks? A linked tweet in October? C’mon man. I’m in dozens and dozens of servers. This is not the way you communicate with your followers. It’s a terrible look.
91,@NFTethics 3/ absolutely no way I’d mint anything from the KB team rn.
92,@NFTethics 2/ Until then I gave them the benefit of the doubt but if you know anything about this space you know that’s absolutely unacceptable. The only possible conclusion is that the project was ghosted when it was clear it wouldn’t succeed to mint. No “hang in there with us”. Nothing.
93,"@NFTethics 1/ Dunno how ethical or rigorous this investigation was, but I do know that the last official announcement of any kind in the @KB24NFT discord was by @andytreys_ on October 19th, 2021… regarding the challenges of filing this legally."
