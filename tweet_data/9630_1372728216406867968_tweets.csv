Internet requires low capital.
YouTube provides free education.
Not many excuses today for those of us living in countries who aren't in a war zone."
5,"@MunkHype @beaniemaxi C'mon man...that was not a rug, beanie didn't even create that coin.

There have been hundreds and hundreds of projects were a real rug happened and the founders completely vanished with all the money.  That's the bad stuff."
6,"So you're telling me that an entire country's war chest is only two and a half times the size of Apple's cash reserve?

26,"What if the NFT world is like Silicon Valley in 1996?

Early Silicon Valley everyone kinda knew each other...like the NFT community today.

Big corporations didn't go to Silicon Valley...the techies permeated the world and changed it.

I think NFTers will do the same thing."

39,"We should have simply declared that Ukraine wouldn't be allowed into NATO.  I believe this would have avoided war.

Now there are people saying the US should get involved in the conflict.  This is also poor job judgement."

41,"@Schornack A very smart, numbers guy, friend of mine told me that the Real Estate shock from builders halting production in 2008-2011 is still being felt today.  Population growth is still outpacing supply and builders have not caught up.  Strong RE market for the foresable future."
42,"@Neckville @nftworldsNFT I would argue that NFT @Twitter is Version 1 of the metaverse.  Twitter will become more and more immersive over time and be the leader.  Started with NFT identities, then we got spaces.  Next will be spaces with video and Avatar Lens feature built in...then vr's with twitter app"
43,"@beaniemaxi No chance Twitter would actually care about this unless someone made a big deal about it.  

Seems pretty clear that you were a creator."

46,@holmers9 @beaniemaxi It pays to pay attention
47,"@beaniemaxi But Beanie, how will the scam, rug pull projects make money?  

They'll all have to actually provide value and these folks aren't prepared to do any real building."

But I think your theory above is the most likely. With so many scams, that seems like a super likely thing."
91,@beaniemaxi I just haven't spent enough time with it to see if any of this information is able to be looked up publicly
92,"@beaniemaxi When you register an ENS name, You can associate it with all sorts of information such as a Bitcoin wallet address, Litecoin address, website email etc"
93,@beaniemaxi Can you see emails through the ENS directory?  Does anybody know??
94,@ZssBecker 🤣
95,"@ajv No matter what, will always be some that get very upset.  

IMO, using the same wallet covers it.  You should be able to freely talk to whomever you want about whatever you want.  And tweet whatever feels right. Its easy to track wallets or review wallets.

Intent matters most."
