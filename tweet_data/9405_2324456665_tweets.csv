5,@thecooltable3 @ChrisMurphyCT In that case Putin is an idiot. He should read the lyrics of the Ukrainian national anthem. Ukrainians fought and won in 2004 and 2014!

8,@JgaltTweets @iabvek @Jotto999 My expectation was that he knew what the situation is in Ukraine in reality. He’s an ex-KGB agent. His was trained to find out the truth and gather intelligence. Turns out he might have been delusional. 😳
9,"@JgaltTweets @iabvek @Jotto999 I guess that’s the difference between me and Putin. I knew that if he invades, his life will become hell. He somehow didn’t realize this due to bad information or overconfidence."
10,"@JgaltTweets @iabvek @Jotto999 I still don’t understand why he decided to turn himself into Hitler. When I bet,  didn’t know that the Russian army is in such a bad state. Demoralized and incompetent. I would have been even more confident that he won’t invade had I known this. 🤔"

14,@iabvek @JgaltTweets @Jotto999 Time magazine called him the most powerful man in the world. Russia hosted World Cup and Olympics. He lost 20 years of careful and meticulous work overnight.
15,"@iabvek @JgaltTweets @Jotto999 Putin was strategically building relationships with the West and feeding them Russian propaganda through “Russia Today”, which was in many languages. He was strategically working on brainwashing Germans (which is why Germany was against supplying weapons to Ukraine)."
16,"@iabvek @JgaltTweets @Jotto999 Look at what’s happening. Russian soldiers are being turned into meat 🥩. Crippling sanctions. Even if they manage to overpower Ukraine, then what? Going in was suicide for Putin. Whoever was betting yes, were betting that Putin wanted suicide."
