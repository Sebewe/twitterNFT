12,"@JoeSchroeNFT @paul_wik @TheReelPhilD @MoHDI Ya. Surprised the full sales history can't be easily queried. IIRC @NftBig1 had a Flowscan scraper? @rayvin_io has API (https://t.co/cnE2tiVAXb) to get history and @BallerzSales posts real-time tx. Would be cool if the history was easily queryable (e.g., via @DuneAnalytics etc)."
13,"@paul_wik @TheReelPhilD Real-time listings at Rayvin. Long term historical data, not sure! @MoHDI looked into it a bit. Should be a DB of all historical sales (e.g., Dune has this data for OpenSea). @JoeSchroeNFT might now where to get it? https://t.co/NyMXSNo2yZ"

18,@dkrazey @caravaggeeoh @NftBig1 @observablehq Which streamlit dash are you looking at?
19,"@dkrazey @caravaggeeoh @NftBig1 @observablehq There’s some other options, too: @graffle_io V2 API will have historical sales for FLOW and flow-beam may have it now. Been on vacay so have not had time to dig in. If py scraper code used here is public, it would be another useful tool."
20,@caravaggeeoh @NftBig1 @dkrazey @observablehq Python client to pull data from FLOW would be nice and is common for ETH; see https://t.co/vpmjbXPJYE
21,@NftBig1 @caravaggeeoh @dkrazey @observablehq Nice work! Curious is your scraper code pubic? I’d be curious to do some one-off / ad hoc analysis (no dashboard) on historical sales data.

79,"@analyst_seth @FrankyBreezy agreed. looking at rarity v price for the sales you can see 1/ many (less rare) cluster ~$2k floor, 2/ long tail of high priced (&gt;$10k) rares (e.g., MJ), 3/ curve seems to flip to much higher prices ~rarity 2000, 4/ still some outliers (3116). https://t.co/EH6lpdI07A"
80,"@SaltMarsh1079 @SchefterBallerz @FrankyBreezy @JoeSchroeNFT lol, FR you scored. ya it will be interesting to see how it plays out when MP opens. a lot of ppl who are not paying much attention might just unload to get a quick 10x (assuming floor ~$2k) even w/ rares."
81,"@SaltMarsh1079 @SchefterBallerz @FrankyBreezy @JoeSchroeNFT holy shit, you are stacked. putting out a feeler: 3 ETH for #4353?"
82,@SaltMarsh1079 @SchefterBallerz @FrankyBreezy @JoeSchroeNFT No doubt. I heard somewhere (maybe in Discord?) that ~4k ppl who wanted #Ballerz were unable to purchase at mint. That baseline unfilled demand + hype over the past few wks will probably make these pre-MP trades very good deals for buyers.
