34,@papertrails14 @AbstraxNFTs @muratpak I already bought 7 lol
35,@AbstraxNFTs @papertrails14 @muratpak Yeah I think pak is gonna keep the floor up and just keep locking up supply there’s only 550 it’s so easy to corner this and they have unlimited eth basically
36,@papertrails14 @AbstraxNFTs @muratpak The other ones haven’t caught like this one did and this has the first mover advantage. People like pak are gonna just lock up supply this thing could really run imo
37,@AbstraxNFTs @papertrails14 @muratpak Also @muratpak keeps sweeping they just bought more https://t.co/C4vvGSppp2
38,@AbstraxNFTs @papertrails14 @muratpak Lol that’s basically what I’m thinking. Only 550 supply too

79,@ethernaz https://t.co/2ZG8DZutyK
80,@CryptoPopcan @AraDG11 I think next week the price will be higher than it is now and we will continue this uptrend forming on the weekly chart. How long it takes to climb I have no idea
81,@BTC_doctor So is $3k lol
82,"@AraDG11 @CryptoPopcan Eventually, yeah. I’m not saying that will happen next week but I think the price will be higher next week than it is now. We are in an uptrend on the weekly chart forming higher lows just like we did between 5/16/21 - 7/18/21 right before we had a breakout"
83,@JMLcapital https://t.co/OJR63xcCdG
84,@AraDG11 @CryptoPopcan $btc and $eth have both retraced back to where they were right before the market dumped. They have already recovered
85,"RT @krugermacro: Bottom is in for stocks and crypto

Top in for precious metals

Market telling you that"
86,@CryptoPopcan Are you holding any eth rn or are you all in stables? 1700 is not programmed. It’s what the whales want and it’s not a guarantee. We are seeing higher lows and we are in an uptrend on the weekly. I am zoomed out
87,@MiguelTH83 Yup a lot of people panic sold over the last 24 hours and are hoping markets slide down even further so they can swing trade and turn a profit/position themselves better. Beware the fud
88,@CryptoPopcan My heart goes out to everybody in Ukraine but making impulsive decisions at a time like this just because of what the media is pumping almost never ends well
89,@CryptoPopcan A lot of people panic sold all their assets recently so I’m expecting a lot of fud. The world is not on fire there are invasions every day that nobody talks about. Look at the correction we saw from covid in March 2020 and look what happened after that to all global markets
90,This is the fear that everybody tells you to buy. This is the fear that not everybody can handle buying. This is opportunity $eth
91,Everybody that said $eth was hitting $1700 punching the air rn
92,@OsamuKisho Could retest that $1700 like a lot of people think but idk man this could be bottom
93,@steve7885 Yeah it hit $1700 and hasn’t broken $2k since
94,What if this is the last time you can buy $eth under $3k and the last dip was the last time you can buy it under $2k
95,@KingBlackBored I like it. This is the long and short for $btc on https://t.co/4x4PKa8wzk rn. We’ll see what happens over the next few days 💎🙌 https://t.co/pivkmb329C
96,"@Crypto_DEFI_ZA Idk, when it comes to preserving your wealth in an occupied territory it seems like the best thing to use to hide your money from people"
97,In all seriousness if $btc and $eth are digital gold then why would you sell rn? I’m hodling my $eth pile tighter than ever before https://t.co/5FAIlTahl7
98,@pram_eth It looks like we should be buying gold and selling drugs https://t.co/KljWR4flKX
