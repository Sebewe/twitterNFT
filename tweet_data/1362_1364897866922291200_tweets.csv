Why? You can burn them 🔥

I learned from @muratpak that burning NFTs is nice. 

So stack dem pods.

@Nike patented “CryptoKicks” back in 2019 – physical shoes with a NFT counterpart to verify ownership. 

How big are the odds that #CloneX will be the first to see this patented tech in action?

BIG

35,@OddStockTrader @Nike @adidas Weird… doesn’t show for me
36,"@WelcomeHomeJose @DYORCLUBNFT @Nike @adidas Ah sorry fren, didn’t notice. 

Well honestly I was in your boat too. I just got lucky on a @muratpak NFT that I decided to burn to have enough capital for a mintvial. 

You’ll get one eventually for sure! 💪🏻"
37,@OddStockTrader @Nike @adidas Really? What was their first one? The POAP?
38,"@WelcomeHomeJose @DYORCLUBNFT @Nike @adidas Or just believe in a project and the team from the get go.

Be early and pay &lt;8K before getting airdropped additional value that exceeds your initial investment. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Look for opportunities bro, not problems. 

Oh, floor is almost 10x public mint. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️"
39,"@User16239 @Nike @adidas Free. 

You payed 16k for your Clone and Clone alone.

Which has its own utility aside from airdrops (3D).

However it also grants you access to be part of the ecosystem. 

Pods airdrop, MNLTH airdrop, and an airdrop on your airdropped pod. 

That alone already recoups that 16k…"
40,"@NFTArtChurro @Nike @adidas Well tbf a POAP is just a token of event attendance.

Technically a NFT yes. 

However, I am referring to the way of how these corporations enter the web3 space. 

Should have perhaps highlighted that in the tweet."
41,@MajorShankEm @Nike @adidas 😂😂😂
42,"@User16239 @Nike @adidas The @Nike brand is presented front and center on the NFT.

@RTFKTstudios = @Nike 

They announced the free drop, mentioned the snapshot date, and how to get it. 

In other words: 

Anyone could get in on the Nike NFT by simply pledging an investment to support the ecosystem."
43,"@noah_rare @Nike @adidas Again. There is no comparison here. 

I am simply stating the distribution process of NFTs by these corporations trying to acquire a market share in the web3 space. 

There is clearly a difference in attention to detail which has nothing to do with the underlying communities."
44,"@fasteddiegloor @Nike @adidas I’m not.

I am mentioning corporations, not NFT communities.

There is a difference in attention to detail when it comes to these corporations’ approach of gaining market share in web3. 

That is what I am stating."

I need to prepare my thesis presentation.

53,"So the majority belief is that the ongoing airdrop will be generative of nature. 

I agree with this speculation. 

Value will be created for the community as a whole and individual holders in a greater way too! 

It’s like a new collection being created. 

Free for holders. https://t.co/1MCJFQMBQQ"
