16,@kerobaldwin Now this is a goof AND a gaff.
17,"@DillyDilly_eth @LoganJames @cr0ssETH Oh damn, this Right Click Saver is 🔥🔥🔥. Haven't seen one with the REI Jacket trait before. Very bullish on this whole collection."
18,Absolutely gross behavior. https://t.co/UzfEfm3RZo
19,"The artist has actual, legal documentation claiming to own the IP behind the artwork. Unless @WeatheReportNFT provides any actual, documented legal evidence to counter the artist's claims, this project is just begging to be taken down from OpenSea.

34,"@0xRabidus @beezle_NFT @DCLBlogger Is that how wash trading works? I’ve never found an NFT in my laundry, so Reddit people must know some big secret I’m not grasping."
35,"@beezle_NFT @0xRabidus @DCLBlogger I feel this. Legit could have covered my whole wedding with the money I spent on NFT taxes, but apparently Reddit people who have read a few blog posts know of some cool way I could have just committed tax fraud wash trades? Gotta pick their brains and burn some rainforests."
36,"@beezle_NFT @0xRabidus @DCLBlogger I just paid a shit ton in taxes on NFTs this year, but apparently according to Reddit people I could have just laundered that money instead? Down bad."
37,"Twitter people: ""Support independent artists!""

Brie Larson: *Buys original NFT artwork from independent artist*

Twitter people: ""WTF!"""
38,@Garebear__11 The irony of someone with a Funko Pop profile picture complaining about NFTs is absolutely wild. Do you have any idea how much plastic waste Funko Pops produce?  https://t.co/BlevUY6HiY
39,"@pcsegal You: ""I defended bullying marginalized people, and someone called me on it. I have most certainly won this interaction!"" Congrats man, glad it made your day."
40,"@pcsegal Certainly you're not just reply-guying me to defend bullying without actually being a bully yourself, right? Or are you just someone who enjoys advocating for bullying?"
41,"@pcsegal I'm sorry to hear you think in terms of bad faith rhetorical tricks. I can see you're so used to arguing in bad faith that you're unable to imagine anyone else arguing in good faith. Enjoy your continual bullying of marginalized people, certainly your efforts will stop evil NFTs!"
42,"@pcsegal No, my stance is: ""a Twitter influencer with a 50k follower platform shouldn't target and post the name of an independent marginalized artist for her followers to laugh at."" 

Your stance is: ""Bullying is okay if I can convince myself that the victims deserve it."" Gross."
43,"@pcsegal Merritt posted a screenshot of the artists names. The artist is responding in the comments. The artist also posted she's receiving abuse. But yeah, you're right, she's prob lying because nobody who cares about ethics in video game journalism would bully a marginalized person."
44,"@pcsegal I found a lot of nasty, bullying comments in this thread, accusing the artists of scamming people, lying, and making fun of their identity. Fucked up to do this over duck pictures. Also fucked up to use a 50k follower platform to shit on an indie artist

https://t.co/LH0JnTGSeo"
45,"@pcsegal No, my theory is that plenty of people are saying abusive things publicly, but you refuse to acknowledge them because you're not arguing in good faith and are unwilling to acknowledge that you ideologically agree with bullying marginalized artists when it fits your agenda."
46,@pcsegal @boredzter @0x65x @merrittk The irony is that I remember Gamergaters making similar arguments when marginalized people spoke up about the harassment they were receiving. The worst were usually in DMs.
47,@RudolfBoogerman @trevorjonesart @artnome I agree.
48,@captlavenders They already are. https://t.co/j4OghF1FoM
49,@ExistentialEnso I’m so confident that mainstream sentiment will come around eventually. You don’t deserve a single bit of the hate you’ve gotten over this. Even watching it go down has been so frustrating. I hope you keep creating and thriving despite all the bullshit.
50,"@nextfckingthing @ShikamaruNFT Tbh, CloneX would still be 🔥🔥🔥 at .1 ETH."
51,"@RudolfBoogerman @trevorjonesart Unfortunately, that part is somewhat accurate. The sheer quantity of trash NFTs is staggering. The thing is, almost nobody is buying most of them. Most of the volume is legit collections."
52,"@OttoSuwenNFT To be fair, Mekaverse looked much better."
53,@katecursed @ExistentialEnso The way this is playing out is indicative of just how toxic Twitter hate circlejerks are. They don’t like NFTs so they target…a marginalized artist who managed to pay off her debts with her NFT art.
54,@boredzter @0x65x @merrittk That’s an incredibly bitter way to view other people’s success.
55,"@boredzter @0x65x @merrittk I think it’s a very cool achievement for marginalized artists to go from being completely broke to making enough money to pay off their housing costs through jpeg sales. Then again, I actually support artists, so I can see why you might not understand. Have a nice one!"
56,"@boredzter @0x65x @merrittk There’s a difference between their names being published in an article talking about a cool achievement, and their names being posted by a Twitter personality encouraging their 50k follower base to bully them. Maybe you’ve heard of this amazing thing called context?"
57,@boredzter @0x65x @merrittk How about the one where she posted their real names? You think that using your 50k follower blue checkmark Twitter account to come after some random independent artist is…good? https://t.co/XYx0T9KwAs
58,"@merrittk You posted their real names from your blue check mark 50k follower account. You leveraged your platform to bully some random, marginalized artists. https://t.co/04ilvrZcin"

62,"@chrishanson1994 @ExistentialEnso Agreed. It’s really gross behavior imo, and it exclusively results in keeping independent creatives down at the bottom rung. Like, complaining about it and attacking artists isn’t hurting the tech CEOs and the big name celebrities. It’s only hurting artists."
63,@Toprak3d @RTFKTstudios Would love one. 0x9BE947791880718A2A0D5baf6EA8b883948eEbe4
64,"@jd_pressman @ExistentialEnso A lot of people only care about issues to the extent that those issues don’t require self-reflection. Energy costs for NFTs = bad, burning down rainforest (?), world is ending. Energy costs for other collectibles, gaming, w/e hobby they like = “Just participating in society!”"
65,"@jd_pressman @ExistentialEnso It’s especially funny because it applies to a lot of other “non-essential” markets too. IE: the collectible market (which is also hugely energy intensive in terms of plastic waste, manufacturing costs, packaging, etc.)."
66,"@ExistentialEnso Just wanted to say, I’ve been following your story and I think it’s hugely inspirational. What you managed to do with NFTs is incredible, and I’m so sorry that so many people who claim to be allies are actually bullies trying to take that away from you."
67,"@ExistentialEnso Unfortunately, everyone loves to say “support underprivileged artists” just so long as those underprivileged artists are willing to accept $40 for a 1/1 commission. But as soon as those same artists need enough to actually pay rent, they call those same artists greedy sell outs."
68,Congrats @H4N1M0N. Web3 is the only place where creators can earn massive benefits like this with no barriers to entry other than their pure talent. Welcome! https://t.co/7mf1IYwUYh

70,@benitopagotto I’m a professional journalist/writer who transitioned from entertainment/pop journalism into crypto journalism. It’s def weird seeing outlets I used to read doing poorly sourced clickbait on NFTs. I’m hoping to be a part of changing that. Some of my work: https://t.co/SSlR2mHrHP
71,"@nftmaintenance @thurverde @NFTherder Thx, I asked the artist to send me some proof that it’s his art being used. If so, I’ll put them on blast."

81,@DeepHouseEth Great thread. My single favorite clone is a Mk-1. I think they look awesome and are severely undervalued.
82,"@fungibleartist One of the biggest issues is that a lot of them can't fathom actually paying artists for their art. They think that ""supporting artists"" means paying $60 for a 1/1 unique commission, instead of, you know, making sure artists have the means to actually pay their rent."
