12,"To let go of your Mories now is a disservice to not only all our FaMorie, but to @iwwon_official by disrespecting his drive and determination to bring us nothing but the best. 7661 is truly my Morie till the end. It was my first tweet on this account and it will hold true."
13,@Knuckl3z__ @iwwon_official @CryptoMories @opensea @LooksRareNFT I could recognize this Morie anywhere. You definitely got this for a steal.
14,"Everyone crying over the pixelmon mint doing 70M in sales and not delivering shit. 

Any project making 70  million dollars does not give a rats ass about you I can guarantee it."
15,Web3 means I get to have a conversation with the CEO of a multimillion dollar project by tweeting at them
16,"@iwwon_official I understand. But still I feel as if they have done nothing but made a mockery of your project. However that is probably why you are the founder of Mories, clearly your capacity for love outweighs the hatred. All love Iwwon ❤️🤝"
17,@iwwon_official Iwwon how can you not have inherent bias towards the OpenSea founders and team when they have so clearly ignored the amount of love and positivity the Mories has by not verifying us? It is the biggest sign of disrespect towards the Mories I can imagine.
18,Im so excited for chubbykaijudao the devs are so active it makes me so happy and excited for a project. Finally a project that gets me excited to be part of it
19,@quangocracy I think there’s a service you can pay and it’ll remove the bots for you. I remember @ElectionDayMad1 tweeting something about it
20,Nvm he sold it instantly I hate him
21,@Laurel_Bore @LooksRareNFT Exit and say goodbye. Once Coinbase NFT comes out looks can’t compete.
22,Sent my brother in law ETH for a wedding gift. Love Web3

25,Ok guys I’m gonna sell my eth for liq BUT ITS NOT PANIC I NEED TATTOO MONEY. OK. NO JUDGING ME.
26,So happy to see patriotic Americans during these times ❤️
27,"@TheShamdoo @apehammer I think a day to relax and reflect is important. If we ignore the situation at hand it will spiral out of control and youll miss the deciding factor in the war that you might’ve been able to contribute to.

32,RT @cryptoein: I hope my fellow Americans realize a bit more today how truly blessed and lucky we are to live in a country as free as ours.…
33,I think it’s absolute horse shit that I have to sit and watch the world burn in flames with threats of nuclear war around the corner and STILL have to hand in my college assignments.
34,I bet vitalik could stop this war.
35,If this Russian conflict keeps going I might have to step in.
36,"@Xumiiz It’s a weird spot that we’re in because on one hand the US doesn’t wanna be getting involved because a war is the last thing we need in the world. However Russia is committing a direct attack on democracy, so by the US not getting involved, it’s like we’re giving up on democracy."
