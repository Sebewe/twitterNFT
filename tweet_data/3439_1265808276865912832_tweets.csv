32,"Finish: Boy, oh boy the finish. When you chew on this one it comes to life. More spice from the Amarone Cask come out for a shorter finish then the sweetness of the red wine notes linger around to hang out."
33,"Nose: strong oak presence with the slightest raisin hints

Taste: (I may be biased because I love wine and whiskey but this is like liquid gold to my palette.) This is not for everyone it’s not your bourbon or bolder whiskeys. Sweet oak &amp; grape presence with a hint of apricot."
34,This is one of my favorite bottles I tried in 2021 and I tried close to 300 different whiskeys last year. #Whiskey
