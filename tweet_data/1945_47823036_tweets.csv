He tweeted about brands mentioning crypto or web3 during the SuperBowl!

https://t.co/42BNjZBMGY"
16,"And since so many NFTs are worth so much, it does make a lot of sense to know as much about NFT security as possible.

Here's a cool idea how to be safer while using MetaMask.

17,"But where is one supposed to get this much #eth from?

Trading NFTs maybe? User CirrusNFT shared his story and how he got from .6E to 150E.

I can only teach you how to do it the opposite way. Going from 150 to .6E. 💀 

https://t.co/H5U2E3rnFl"

35,@crispylines The future is here 😅
36,@ondrejzunka One can't argue with that 🤣
37,"@ondrejzunka Or even better ""Don't look Up""👀"
38,"@thedefiedge I should probably take this advice as well. Been obsessed with growth and now that it slowed down I'm feeling extra pressure.

Should focus on my long term goal"
39,"@UncleAndyCrypto For like a day yes. But they're risking like 30k. The profit ratio here is like 0,1%.

Only ultra rich folks bought this for the fun of it."
40,"@unnamed_owl @doodles @BoredApeYC I thought the thread will have just one reply with:

I got a doodle for 5E, cause the seller didn't read the warning ⚠️😅☠️"
41,"@wsavas Amen. This is just a clear sign that people who buy these kind of NFTs don't have any connection to money at all. They all must be millionaires playing with their ""play money""."
42,"@NFTethics @nftchance They're being proactive, there method of avoiding being exposed by you guys 🤣

Plan for today:
Write a new Yesterday in Crypto thread, and also work on a new video for my TikTok channel. I'm noticing that I enjoy working on videos a lot as well.

I'm working from home since 2004 and in that whole time interacted with people from across the world.

Yet, it feels different now, when I open my laptop and start talking to somebody across the world in San Francisco.

I think it has to do with the fact..."

Hopefully, I'll be able to be part of the project's bright future. ✌️

Yesterday I've also had a 30min zoom call with @mdelucia21 who's Chief of Staff over at @IslandsXYZ.

We had a great talk and discussed among other things a potential collaboration."
62,"2/
Yesterday I submitted my application for a role at the @TheHashmasks project.

I'm holding a mask for almost half a year and think the whole project is massively undervalued in terms of #eth, but also in terms of aesthetics, future outlook, and community."
