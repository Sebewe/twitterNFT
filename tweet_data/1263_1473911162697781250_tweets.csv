18,@HonestTrad3r Shame. Good call!
19,@skittles373737 Nothing is confirmed because its not released yet. But this is the idea. To have the clone be an all in one that you can take to other worlds like sandbox and use it.
20,"Clarification.

Your clone IS the sandbox voxel clone. It’s built in! One and the same!

You sign in on Sandbox and your clone will have a voxel version for you to use (in the future, not released yet)

Thats a metaverse move 🧠 https://t.co/CweGqW3Mab"
21,"Don’t blame @0xPolygon

Polygon works 👍

Whats happening is Opensea pays the gas for you when you use Polygon.

But they only pay when its cheap &amp; demand for NFTs are high so its never cheap. So nothing works.

Opensea needs an option to pay your own gas. This solves everything."
22,@DrSunsetizer @mscorsteezy Agreed! Be careful! I usually give 30-60 minutes to allow the transaction to go through or fail. If its still their after that time its highly likely that the transaction actually failed.
23,"@DrSunsetizer Gotchu fam.

26,"If anything in this thread confused you, please read my other educationals on Opensea and Polygon

https://t.co/CKsBkGnx6m"
27,"The actual solution would be if Opensea created a toggle or switch of some sort that allows the user to pay for their own gas when using Polygon on Opensea. If that were the case, it would work like ETH with 1-2 cent gas fees. (This is how polygon actually is outside of Opensea)"
28,"It’s important to note that the offers that are being created when you make a purchase are not actually offers. 

They are how Opensea interprets your pending transactions.

If the creator accepts these fake offers. It will immediately fail because the transaction no longer exist"
29,"The solution:

If your transaction doesn’t go through within an hour. Cancel your offer and make a new purchase.

Transactions fail if they are waiting for gas prices to come into range for too long.

But Opensea wont show you it failed. It’ll show your offer still sitting."
30,"Purchasing on Opensea with Polygon:

When you buy something with Polygon, if the gas is too high, it creates a offer. The offer is your transaction pending.

If gas prices drop, it’ll go through.

If it doesn’t, the transaction drops.

BUT Opensea will still show the offer.

Something to help educate the community with Polygon and Opensea. How they interact and how we can use the platforms.

54,"If you receive an error buying something on Polygon through Opensea. Wait 30 minutes. It'll most likely still go through.

Your transaction was created its just waiting for network congestion to dip into an area that your transaction gets picked up.

It'll show up as an offer."

58,"Fill Block 13 and hit write!

It will populate a transaction for your Metamask.

That's it! You now have full control of your Opensea NFTs for transferring.

Using this method you'll never have a stuck or errored transaction

🎉🥳"
59,"Block 13 is asking for the following:

I know it might look confusing. Don't worry!

_from (address) = This is you! Your own address
to (address) = The address receiving the NFT
id (uint256) = tokenid
amount (uint256) = Quantity, usually just 1
data (bytes) = write ""0x""

Example: https://t.co/Fs9KskcrFC"
60,"Perfect your almost there!

Scroll down to Block 13. This is the safeTransferFrom function.

61,"Once you've found your NFT on Polygonscan you can add the following to the end of the URL: ""#writeContract""

Or navigate to ""Contract"" &gt; ""Write""

https://t.co/QmhDcMJWWY"
62,"Now to find your NFT on Polygonscan.

Use the URL breakdown. It should look like this:
https://t.co/p6H8IUKFea

Polygonscan uses a similar URL format to Opensea. 

/token/smartcontractaddress?a=tokenid"
63,"You can alternatively find the Smart Contract Address and Token ID for your NFT in the details section below the metadata on your NFTs while on Opensea.

However, using the link is much faster to copy/paste.

You can just double click the portion on the link you want to copy."
64,"Shortly after the Smart Contract Address there is a ""/""

The address after the ""/"" is your Token ID.

The format Opensea uses is /assets/matic/SmartContractAddress/TokenID"
65,"The information you need to use the URL breakdown above is conveniently in the link on your Opensea NFT.

Example:
https://t.co/bATCOWYwOv

If you open the link to this NFT. You'll see that following ""assets/matic/"" in the link is an address.

This is the Smart Contract Address."
66,"Using Polygonscan we can write directly to Opensea's contract to transfer NFTs.

First we'll look at finding your NFT on Polygonscan.
