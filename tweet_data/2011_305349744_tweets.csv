46,"@_musks @CRAEN_3333 I just want to sell mad domains so I can smoke what you're smoking, renumeration.eth"
47,"@_musks @CRAEN_3333 If you don't understand just look at what I circled. That's you selling a domain to yourself, and the ones not circled are transfers."
48,"@_musks Last I knew transfers cost gas too, but OK. You've internalized and analyzed enough for every ENS domain geek, clearly."
49,"@_musks No it doesn't confuse me, hence why I circled the sale of a .eth address from one wallet of yours to another, where as the ones I didn't circle were clearly transfers. 
 
It's OK your internalizations are off, as well as your analytics, OpenSea probably has it wrong too..."
50,@_musks @CRAEN_3333 You know what if you did this on LooksRare you might actually be able to make some $looks tokens by selling domains back and forth to yourself. Quite silly of you to do such on @opensea
51,"@_musks @CRAEN_3333 I don't mind calling a spade a spade. If you're going to try to use real world data to support your position at least make sure it's correct. Now go back to selling domains to yourself, internalizooooor"
52,@_musks @CRAEN_3333 I don't even have to comment on this one. BLNT internalizoooorr https://t.co/twUb49oOPm
53,@_musks @CRAEN_3333 It shouldn't be the reason you don't understand this ens though. However I do see now why you'd mint something like 'brunobanana.eth' or better yet 'criptopunks.eth' with an i 🤣🤣🤣
54,@_musks @CRAEN_3333 Bruh you're selling domains back and forth between your own wallets. Nothing else needs to be said 🤡
55,"@_musks @CRAEN_3333 Now he's cussing. It's OK your thinking was flawed bc your internalizations were outta wack, sipheriansurge.eth AKA nyandogg.eth AKA blublox.eth AKA mastercardmaestro.eth 🤣🤣🤣"
56,@_musks @CRAEN_3333 I actually bought this bc I saw shipyard go for 3 🤷‍♂️
57,"@_musks @CRAEN_3333 It's very apparent you have multiple names you're listing from, metadepot, personalens, musks... but at least I'm not selling them back and forth to myself 🤡 https://t.co/RKJRpyzKut"
58,@_musks @CRAEN_3333 Never set out to win anything honestly. Just trying to have a debate. You're the one who brought up my sales. Maybe next time I won't try to help you out in your viewpoints by pointing out false information you're using as gospel 🤣
59,@_musks @CRAEN_3333 Imagine making an nft of an .eth domain you minted 🤣🤣🤣 this exemplifies perfectly how you feel about your domain 🤣🤣🤣
60,@_musks @CRAEN_3333 Speaking of rubbish...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/BNZAZBFrTi
61,@_musks This one is especially for people like musks.eth. Glad you enjoy it
62,@_musks @CRAEN_3333 And i didn't even have to do anything for my one and only sale. You have people liking all your .eths for you. Not only that you busted your nut selling hodled.eth for only 3 eth. BLNT internalizoooor
63,@CRAEN_3333 @_musks 🤣🤣
64,"@CRAEN_3333 @_musks He does have 207 likes of musks.eth, whatever that is 🤷‍♂️"
65,"@_musks You're the internalizoooor bro, the market observooor for over one year now! When you say defi.eth sold for too low and you don't even realize it's not the real defi.eth and then try to use it to justify your point, that math add up. Spoiler.eth ALERT"
66,@CRAEN_3333 @_musks Bruh https://t.co/tw8qQULtzt
67,"@_musks ... not wanting to or needing to get higher than a 10 eth purchase on hodl.eth is just that, an idea?"
68,@_musks You should internalize the facts that you were wrong about defi.eth which goes with what you were originally trying to say but bc you 'internalized' the wrong defi.eth your point was mute. Also the fact that my idea of the seller banking hundreds of eth on his domains and maybe..
69,@_musks Bruh I'm the only one commenting on your post. Your cited info is wrong. The only thing I can think of is because expiring names are getting more exposure than ones sitting idle on the marketplace.
70,"@_musks One year huh? Lol

Since you've ""internalized"" the prices, have you ever internalized the fact that the seller of hodl.eth had hundreds of eth worth in sales in such a short time span?

Your suspicions of defi.eth being the best was true, you just had the wrong info"
71,@_musks Well if I was you I'd check your stat source because defi.eth was sold for 40. Maybe that'll adjust your outlook some 🤷‍♂️
72,@_musks This is obv all subjective but imo wifi.eth doesn't compare to any on that list 🤷‍♂️
73,@HunkinsNFT @kaitlin_easton Deed done 💪
74,@_musks Those sold are all top tier domains. Name some specific ones for sale that you think should be included in that list...
