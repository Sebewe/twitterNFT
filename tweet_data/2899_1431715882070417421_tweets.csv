0,@b0nzi_ @nftworldsNFT I previously DMed you about buying back one of the frozen Worlds that was stolen from me. It might be in Message Requests.
1,"@TheDinoSociety The biggest difference is greed. The 2-3 ETH on some anon project are often looking for 10x quick returns. For many it has nothing to do with the art, team, or long-term fundamentals. It’s a fallacy though, way more success is found investing in real creators."
2,"@Shahabs @nftworldsNFT @Temptranquil @iamarkdev Sorry to hear that, I feel your pain."
3,"@mrvarma_ @nftworldsNFT @Temptranquil @iamarkdev Just remember to take your time. Nothing is worth falling for hype and moving too fast. We are so early in this space, for every missed project many more await in the future."
4,@rgr_park Claim is live. I suspect day traders underestimated conviction of World holders. When they realize airdrop won’t be a big sell off everyone will rush back in.
5,@nifty_1337 @nftworldsNFT @Temptranquil @iamarkdev Basically the same thing! You are for sure part of the club 🤗
6,@crispylines I’m in it for the love. The joy of seeing  both creators and their supporters find success. This energy feeding R&amp;D for a broader web3 is the way to build a healthier internet and global community.
7,"DYOR. For me the fundamentals of NFTW are a bullish intersection between Minecraft, Metaverse, NFTs, and crypto economics. It’s a platform that dozens of projects are already building on. I own 5 worlds and will be staking them all long-term."
8,"Who has been with me holding @nftworldsNFT since the free mint?

Today was the final $WRLD snapshot.

What @Temptranquil &amp; @iamarkdev have accomplished in the past 6 months is legendary.

I still think the platform is just getting started 🌎 ❤️"
9,To add I will always try to make my position (holding) and any relationship transparent. If I don’t I hope people call me out!
10,@DashKitto 😂 sorry I already booked a shill for Old Fuzzy Coffee Mugs this week.
11,"I crossed 10k followers 🤯 already get DMs about doing paid shills. Has opened my eyes to how marketing through some influencers works in this space.

Making a commitment now, I will never take any form of compensation for promo. I will only invest and share things I believe in."
12,RT @boardapeballer: @nix_eth You do what you would want to be done to you.
13,@Samtee37371443 @bellejosephinem @DataNFT_ @jungi87 I bet if you applied your effort to legitimate pursuits you would reap 100x more than trying to scam people. DM me if you want help in that.
14,@boardapeballer Perfect answer 🤗
15,@bellejosephinem @DataNFT_ Yes this space seems to bring out the best and worst in people 🤗
16,"@bellejosephinem @DataNFT_ This sucks, I’m sorry. I have had the same experience trying to buy back."
17,"@CivitaApe @Ro_Xicago_Eth Everyone is learning, just at different levels 😊"
18,"Really happy with the @timepieces Slices of TIME drop. Ended up with several amazing pieces 😍

This is my personal favorite, ""Bridging Science &amp; Spirituality, 1973"" by Yulia Brodskaya. Beautiful piece. She isn't on Twitter, her artist statement: https://t.co/Sz2DstUNzb https://t.co/fZOxMI3wz6"
19,@littlelauchie ❤️
20,@renonelab Do good get good is insanely powerful. You rock ❤️
21,"@karimo714 You're beautiful, I would do at least the same ❤️"
22,@karimo714 Yes
23,Question: You buy a very rare NFT for a too good to be true price (below floor). A few hours later you discover it was part of a hack and stolen. It has been blacklisted on a major exchange. The victim reaches out and offers *more* than you paid. What do you do?
24,"@PRNFT1 Why not vault.peterodriguez.eth ? I use sub domains for my vaults, works great 😊"
25,@TakeshisReturn @McGorgeous_eth @nftworldsNFT #NFTWmintGang 🚀
26,"@iamarkdev Answered my own question, did a little digging and it is indeed legitimate."
27,"Beautiful gesture ❤️🙏 - I followed with 1 ETH 🇺🇦

Tx: https://t.co/WdXQI88oFp https://t.co/HJzlpT5ayR"
28,"@JamesEdenpw Hello, can you please DM me about NFT World #5374?"
29,"@iamarkdev I would also like to donate, how did you verify it’s a real account and address?"
30,@jhruth @TheVisitorsNFT Haha friends forever (……or until recycled)
31,@Signalnoise Awesome one! Here is mine. Not sure what they are up to but seems sketchy 😆 https://t.co/T6j0SZF26J
32,@frandsoh @TheVisitorsNFT Thanks friend 🙏 I appreciate you 😊
33,"#NewProfilePic @TheVisitorsNFT #3909 

This is the OG PFP nix was born under.

During the OS Signature Attack dozens of Vizzies jumped into voice chat. Some even offered to fly and come chill with me. This support continues and made a huge difference. Love them all ❤️🙏🤗 https://t.co/T4UohW8IHI"
34,@Namstaaah @nftworldsNFT No real update. Investigations ongoing.
35,Great thread on some technical details for the OpenSea Signature Attack. https://t.co/UayH23KOg7
36,@jpablosanchez @gigabit_eth @punk9059 You must be fun at parties.
37,"@punk9059 @davidbankless @runner_data We only know one thing for certain, because the blockchain doesn't lie. The transfers happened through OS contract, using a valid wyvern order signature, and that the order was crafted in a clever (exploitive) way.

Everything else is speculation and being investigated."
38,"@punk9059 @davidbankless @runner_data I also went through 35 days of browser history page by page, with one of my devs for a second pair of eyes. Nothing jumped out as the regular vector of a fake site. Went through every MM connected site, same thing, nothing crazy."
39,"@punk9059 @davidbankless @runner_data Correct, we do not know how or where it was served. What we do know is it wasn't an email, and wasn't an obvious phishing site. I have been through MM connected sites with 4 other victims. Our overlap is very small (less than 12) - and all trusted well known platforms/projects."
40,"@1202reklaW @punk9059 @hofman_eth It’s been a crazy (and stressful ride). I think most of crypto Twitter just ran with “Email phish, people connected and signed something dumb” and moved on."
41,"@1202reklaW @punk9059 @hofman_eth It’s true we still don’t know, we haven’t heard anything because we still don’t know."
42,"@punk9059 I am one of the victims (lost seven figures worth of NFT Worlds). It wasn’t email phishing, it wasn’t some fake phishing site. Investigations are ongoing, but I think the results are going to shock."
43,"@Leader DMed, also it wasn’t an email, OS has confirmed this publicly."
44,@nifty_1337 @nftworldsNFT @iamarkdev @Temptranquil Would be amazing. They are blocked for trading on OS.
45,@3PiedPiper @nftworldsNFT I haven’t received anything. I think it’s still early - smoke hasn’t cleared yet.
46,"@andypoondesign @nftworldsNFT Thanks sir, I appreciate it 🙏"
47,"@sammy_ruler @nftworldsNFT @belikewater893 Mel is awesome, just DMed! I am a large RR holder."
48,"Where the exploit side comes in is that with this one malicious signed wyvern order it appears the attacker was able to craft any order. Effectively giving full access to any contract approved for the OS proxy (when you ""Approve All"" to list items on OS)."
49,"(Origin in the MM dialog doesn't matter.)

What is believed about this attack is that they crafted a malicious Wyvern order and got victims to sign it somewhere (phished).

https://t.co/BOTvU2REHb"
50,"I am not an expert, this is my understand from what experts have told me.

OpenSea uses Wyvern Protocol (the new and old contract). On older Wyvern signatures looked like the screenshot above. What you are signing is an order to be submitted to the exchange contract."
51,"Ever sign one of these?

This is the reason I call the OpenSea signature attack part phish and part exploit.

🧵 https://t.co/P8unPOamSj"
52,"A few things about the OpenSea signature attack I see media still getting wrong:

- It wasn't from email, they still haven't found the source but I think it is going to surprise people.
- I alone lost over $2MM (all in @nftworldsNFT)
- It appears to be a mixed phish and exploit."
53,@Freecard_NFT @theYounGGod18 Please check DM message requests.
54,"@jeuaneth @opensea @LooksRareNFT @DAO_JOKER @thekinggully I believe they are all locked on OS now. Doesn't prevent attacker from using another marketplace, and many of them have already changed hands more than once."
55,"@kgirl_nfty Thank you for the support. I always knew what great people are in this space, although I am crushed I am reminded of all the beautiful people that want to help 🙏"
56,@NFTYOUIO @AJFromDiscord @ZeeroII @Layer2Trust @fokner65 @_mpoxoqm @mrcse13 @Freecard_NFT @DAO_JOKER @thekinggully @_cynmedia @Nate_Rivers @janclarin @aldrinaldana @ManuSpotstone @0xQuit I did use x2y2 (very carefully) but comparing notes with other victims some didn't use it at all.
57,"@AJFromDiscord @ZeeroII @NFTYOUIO @Layer2Trust @fokner65 @_mpoxoqm @mrcse13 @Freecard_NFT @DAO_JOKER @thekinggully @_cynmedia @Nate_Rivers @janclarin @aldrinaldana @ManuSpotstone Same. I am hunting through everything. From my understand it would have been one single signature that looked like this, and that gave them access to anything you had proxy approved (approve all) on OS. And the origin could have been anything. https://t.co/HPtaUJSmkz"
58,"@DAO_JOKER @NFTYOUIO @Layer2Trust @fokner65 @_mpoxoqm @mrcse13 @Freecard_NFT @thekinggully @AJFromDiscord @_cynmedia @Nate_Rivers @ZeeroII @janclarin @aldrinaldana @ManuSpotstone Hey fellow victim, DM me please."
59,@cyborg_eth Thanks 🙏
60,"Lots of bad information floating around. Wait for facts, OS is doing a good job sifting through.

As a victim I have felt well taken care of, multiple people at OS have reached out to check in and try to help ❤️ https://t.co/uP7T6ariqW"
61,"@iamashchild I didn’t, the only approval was OS. The attack seems to allow the attacker to transfer any OS approved collection (from one signature)."
62,@L0rdHighFix3r @iamarkdev @Portal_____ I lost 20…. (Attacker took all 25 then returned 5) 😢
63,"@L0rdHighFix3r @iamarkdev @Portal_____ Yup good policy. Never click email links. I am the same, if I see something I go straight to the site."
64,@L0rdHighFix3r @iamarkdev @Portal_____ It was likely phished by signing a wyvern transaction somewhere else that took advantage of the way OS validates matches. It wasn’t a simple phishing email with approve all attack vector. https://t.co/yg3J1MiT2t
65,@iamarkdev @L0rdHighFix3r @Portal_____ I am not a contract dev but the way I understand it I could have signed a wyvern transaction somewhere that seemingly had nothing to do with OS but basically granted full access to any of my OS proxy approvals.
66,@iamarkdev @L0rdHighFix3r @Portal_____ It was confirmed by OS to not be. It was more sophisticated than a simple phish (I never even click email links). https://t.co/Aycla5xS4I
67,@iamarkdev 😢 🌎
68,@L0rdHighFix3r @Portal_____ @iamarkdev It wasn’t a phishing attack to migrate.
69,@kgirl_nfty @Helloimmorgan Thanks for the invite 🙏 - I am in a rough place and don't have the energy for a public space. Spending time with friends :)
70,"@kgirl_nfty @IndexOfSus Thanks, I am pretty beat up, I can't face a public chat right now."
71,"Thanks for the support everyone ❤️🙏, @OpenSea has reached out and I had a call with them. They are investigating and on top of it, I am impressed, helping however I can."
72,"@LeLennyBoi Oh yes, a lot"
73,I would really appreciate the help of an expert that is respected in the space. This is devastating to me and I need to decide how to move forward. Without knowing what went wrong I don't know what to do to mitigate future losses.
74,"@spaghettiNFT No, I checked. I did not get this, I had not migrated or used the new contract."
75,@LootsNFT Nope
76,"@kgirl_nfty @SooltanEth @opensea @nftworldsNFT Not listed, not migrated."
77,"@CyphrETH I lost 25 NFT Worlds, I didn't use the new contract. Didn't fall for phishing."
78,"I honestly don't know what happened. I am a dev, long time crypto user, hardware wallet. I did have NFT Worlds approved on OpenSea. I didn't migrate or use the new contract yet."
79,"Everyone - it appears I was compromised. This is a sick huge loss. I don't know what happened. I am going to have to figure it out. 25 NFT Worlds stolen, attacker returned 5 for some reason."
80,@CountofZurich I am psyched that the ecosystem is going to be curated by staked World owners. They will decide the P2E rate and what projects are eligible for it.
81,@xAli7_ What is the first thing you check in on?
82,@NonFungibleSamu It’s not even a fair fight though 😂
83,@TheVisitorsNFT @nftworldsNFT @CBCreepz ⬆️ the biggest alpha. What makes it great is how helpful and respectful we all are to each other. The shared belief that we succeed together. It’s a magic place I almost scared to tell others about 😆
84,@littlelauchie @timepieces You can burn a slice for a random artist piece (but soon it will be over and you won’t be able to burn any more).
85,The part of this that hypes me the most is that a DAO of stakers will curate the P2E faucet. Decentralized ownership and governance! https://t.co/PTaPIXzYgO
86,@Sea_Note08 @timepieces https://t.co/XOdd3Wrnbs
87,"@bennft33 @FomoMofoNFT @skuxxverse @HeroGalaxyNFT Haha 😅 left that out, of course I do!"
88,"@bennft33 I have @FomoMofoNFT @skuxxverse @HeroGalaxyNFT, what am I missing?"
89,@JLivingstoneB We all thought it was a metaverse platform but really it was the biggest Turing test ever! https://t.co/IAIWxAKlbm
90,"Mine: Ark is really Markus Persson using deep fake to hide, but he is doxxing himself because Elon Musk is going to buy Minecraft from Microsoft and roll it together with NFT Worlds."
91,What is everyone's best guess? The wilder the better! https://t.co/BdguZeEi5c
92,"@TalmadgeOrion @nftworldsNFT When I was personally doing DD I looked at Decentraland/Sandbox market, Minecraft data (especially MAUs), the non-crypto Minecraft economy (service providers, large communities, building, etc), and gaming NFT trends. I feel 10x from today is a very conservative estimate."
93,"@TalmadgeOrion @nftworldsNFT It is hard to evaluate. Your perspective makes sense when just considering $wrld rewards, but the worlds have other value (utility) as well, also we have yet to see how the leasing economy develops."
94,@Schagwelll @nft_metaman Same question 😉
95,"@memphis_mantis @the_x2y2 No problem, always DYOR 😉. In the end I think we will have dozens of popular marketplaces. Part of the beauty of web3 is you own the content, account, everything, so it doesn't matter what site you transact on. They will all target different niches."
96,@Gabadadi Also the team had so much conviction they minted the project for free. Never did paid or hype marketing. Just built and delivered. The opposite of a house of cards or amateur.
97,"@Gabadadi I disagree. Non crypto Minecraft is a multi billion dollar economy, and I am not talking about MC itself (the platform) but the businesses/people building on it. As a platform MC continues to lead the Metaverse. Gaming is the next big crypto adopter. It is the perfect storm. https://t.co/MX2b6cQR4t"
98,"@Matt_i_e @timepieces I guess I could always keep them all and just buy the artist pieces I like 😆, win/win"
99,"@memphis_mantis @the_x2y2 It ran smooth and fast, UX was easy to follow. The bulk tool was literally perfect (marketplaces need more tools like this). You could feel that the product team is professional and experienced. With 20 years building dev &amp; product teams you just pick up a sense for it."
