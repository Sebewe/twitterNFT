2,@BellyFlopClub @Trezor Yes
3,"RT @alexmillertech: The Frame folks are awesome. Read about how they fixed Trezor's breaking changes themselves 👇

As users, please do keep…"
4,@punk6529 @opensea @Trezor ✌️Here’s a quick explainer of what happened: https://t.co/nAd0Ewsnoz
5,We got beta.13 out ASAP because we ❤️ our users and don't want to leave them hanging no matter who is at fault. However we encourage @Trezor to work more closely with the Ethereum ecosystem to understand how their hardware is being used and what their users want.
6,"3. Better communication: if breaking changes do need to be made, we'd like to see them communicated clearly. Obviously these changes can be disruptive and in the crucial time period of adoption after a new release better, more receptive support is key."
7,"2. Consider all users: once a public library is published, it can be assumed it has users. One of our goals is to build a broader, more robust web3 community and breaking the contract of a widely used library at the request of one specific user is extremely exclusionary."
8,1. Adhere to versioning best practices: breaking changes should be versioned as such. Releasing major breaking changes under a patch release more or less defeats the purpose of versioning in the first place.
9,So what would we like to see improved in the future?
10,For them to then break this integration without any advance notice or adherence to best practices shows a disregard for users and clients of their library and is a real detriment to an Ethereum ecosystem that already has to deal with a lack of wallet continuity and coherence.
11,The irony of this is that Frame is one of the few -- if not only -- wallets to implement EIP-712 signing for @Trezor and to do so in a timely manner. We took great pains to support their new specification quickly and make this functionality available for users.
12,"Due to noise being made on Twitter they decided to investigate. They stated the change was ""requested by the MetaMask team"", ""doubted this change would affect any users of this library"" since EIP-712 signing for Trezor was recently released, and refused to fix the issue."
13,"We reached out to @Trezor for an explanation or a fix but received little to no response. Their cursory replies were blasé and dismissive. Our support request was answered 3 days later with a simple ""no one else is experiencing this, it must be a problem on your side""."
14,"Last week @Trezor published trezor-connect v8.2.7 which, despite only incrementing the patch version, contained a breaking change for signing EIP-712 typed data. Because trezor-connect dynamically loads the latest major version, Frame's @Trezor integration was immediately broken."
15,"Our latest beta.13 release (https://t.co/27sggawxsL) contained a fix for a change @Trezor made that broke the ability for many of our users to use @Opensea, @LooksRare and possibly other apps. Here's a short thread on what happened and what @Trezor could improve in the future."

32,@punk6529 @opensea @Trezor It seems @Trezor introduced a breaking change to their trezor-connect library earlier today. We reached out to them but have not received a response. Obviously pushing breaking changes like this is very disruptive and we're looking at ways to protect against it in the future.
