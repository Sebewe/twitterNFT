7,@DegenerateJoe69 @PlayColony Isn’t much sell pressure if any at current floor of around 0.08 ETH. In terms of a risk vs reward for selling vs holding it certainly favours holding atm. Have no idea what the game will be like but look forwards to more updates.
8,@DegenerateJoe69 @PlayColony Sustainability. Most P2E games will fail. Colony haven’t launched their game yet. Time will tell if they can deliver on the vision.

56,@ChekoValenciia @InvsbleFriends @ChristiesInc The term bluechip gets thrown around too easily in the NFT space. When in reality there are no blue chips. Maybe punks the only exception. Even BAYC is less than a year old. The real bluechips will be discovered over the next decade as we ride the waves of this volition space.
57,"@BobbyRay47 @InvsbleFriends Feel like a broken record at this point but I’m not trying to fud. Just don’t think the risk vs reward is there for me at the current pricing. It was 13 ETH a few hours post drop, seemed way overvalued. Again this is just my opinion. I’ve been wrong countless times!"

72,"@TripawdCrypto @DaPug0x @StrikXForce @InvsbleFriends Yep. There’s no hate at all, I love the project. It’s definitely not a smart financial decision to buy @ 52X mint unless you’re willing to lose a lot of money in the short term. Again just my opinion!"

75,@frankycooks24_7 @RealMahaloMike @InvsbleFriends I will be the first to say buying an ape for 100 ETH is not smart. Smart money is selling @ 100 not buying. Smart money also doesn’t buy new projects for 52X mint. Got anything else to say? 😉
76,"To clarify, I’m not trying to spread ‘fud’. I’m just being realistic. Buying something @ 52X mint price for a project that dropped a few hours ago is asking for pain. I hope I’m wrong and wish everyone the best, just seen this play out multiple times. Hope everyone is well! 😇"
77,"@elie2222 @InvsbleFriends Yes, you’ve made my point for me. These will drop and the buyers will inevitably lose imo. If you think smart money buys here @ 52X mint then I don’t know what to say. 🤷‍♂️"
78,"@DaPug0x @InvsbleFriends No fud! I love the project. Just think in the short term people will lose a lot of money as most people are just day trading trying to flip from 1 thing to the next. Just sharing my opinion, buying a project @ 52X mint a few hours after it’s dropped usually doesn’t end well."
79,@darksirious2 @InvsbleFriends Not spreading fud. Just being realistic and expressing my opinion! Paying 52X mint price for a project that dropped a few hours ago is just asking for pain. Hope I am wrong but I’ve seen this play out a few times. :)
80,@JasonKi37215521 @HollanderAdam @InvsbleFriends Do you honestly think paying 52X mint price for a project that just dropped a few hours ago is a smart financial decision? I love the project but these valuations are going to leave people rekt. Come back in a few weeks and see for yourself. :)
81,"@RealMahaloMike @InvsbleFriends I absolutely wish everyone the best! Has nothing to do with my pfp, I’m a huge fan of @InvsbleFriends . There is no way buying a project for 52 X mint is the ‘smart money’ move. Do you disagree?"
82,@bgeraldes1 @InvsbleFriends Congrats!
83,"@RobertFowles @InvsbleFriends Minted 2, sold 2! Wish everyone all the best, smart money does not buy @ 52X mint price a few hours post drop. That’s one thing I can say for certain. Do you disagree?"
84,"@HollanderAdam @InvsbleFriends Ikr, not sure how people can pay 52X mint price straight after a project drops and go to sleep at night. 😵‍💫"
85,"@elie2222 @InvsbleFriends For ETH to get to $5000, the market cap needs to significantly increase. This means the money will flow from other assets into crypto. Means that somewhere someone will lose. Could be stocks, housing etc."
86,"People paying 13 ETH for @InvsbleFriends are the reason people can make money in the NFT space. For someone to make 1 ETH someone else has to lose 1 ETH. This is going to be a bloodbath.
