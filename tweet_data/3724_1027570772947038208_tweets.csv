5,"@sugarsmack100 Don't worry! Nothing is getting ""delisted"". The contract upgrade is complete, and if you weren't able to migrate your listing you can still do so in the ""relist dashboard"" found in your account page."
6,"@punk6529 @opensea @Trezor @0xFrame Unfortunately Metamask doesn’t support typed signatures through Trezor yet (though a PR to update this has been approved: https://t.co/PuxOGBPDye). That said, you should be able to still sign in. Recommend clearing your cache and that should fix the issue. If not, LMK."
7,@grelysian @opensea @tigerbobNFT Looking into this one now. Thanks for flagging!
8,"So thrilled to have @chrsackermann on board to drive our efforts around developer experience. Extremely bullish on what more devs can bring to the NFT ecosystem! As I've learned so many times in Web3, where devs go, so goes innovation and the masses. https://t.co/WRZB5yHdXd"

19,@TenorJoshPage @opensea Ha -- try it out ☺️
20,"@Crypt0Waves @opensea Hey there, given the way that signatures work you do need to do this 1 by 1. If you can't work on this now, you can update your listings later too. And it will all be gas-free."
21,@TenorJoshPage @opensea That's right!
22,"@Jon33107044 @opensea Hey! Not at all. The newest tool simply gives you the option to update the listing time on the NFT but the NFT is yours and always will be. And if for some reason you don't update the listing now, you can always do it later too. Tool to do so here: https://t.co/L8Uw5aTHoi"
23,@0xALINFT @opensea Hey so sorry this happened. I just looked into it and all should now be restored. Sorry for the confusion on this one and thanks for flagging it!

35,@farokh @pablostanley So sorry this happened to you. Please feel free to DM me with more info and I'll make sure this gets flagged to the team.
36,"@GooblinTown @opensea Hear you. We will make this very very easy for you, while also making sure your items stay safe. We'll share a lot of updates in advance to make sure you and your community are prepared. I'm here if you have questions along the way."
37,"@TenorJoshPage @opensea Yes, it does. Upgrading to the new contract will ensure old, inactive listings expire - and that would include bundles like you mention."
38,"@Gamingengelpea @opensea Good question! No, you don't. As a part of this upgrade we'll soon be introducing a tool that makes listing migration super simple and not require gas fees. More to come soon!"
39,@PunksAre @opensea Totally hear you. We'll be releasing a tool to make this migration really easy (and gas free!). More to come soon.
40,The @CertusOne team are some of the MOST impressive engineers I've had the pleasure to work with. Had the pleasure of working with them for a bit when they ran a validator node on @OasisProtocol testnets. +1 to everything @bneiluj says below. https://t.co/FyMjiPrUd9
