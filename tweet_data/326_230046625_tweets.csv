32,HARD WALLETS! The team highly recommends setting them up. Ledger or trezor only from direct sites.
33,Frequently revoke permissions on https://t.co/NtAsUUbBUD + etherscan
34,Is the contract you're signing a view only sign or will it have access to more.
35,@ryanis___ tip -- bookmark all the sites you use frequently. Check what you're connecting to.
36,These scams do not just happen to new people. They can happen to anyone. Just because you've been in the space doesn't mean you're not susceptible.
37,@coolcoffeedan did not want to shill the project to his millions of followers in the early days because he wanted to make sure they wouldn't be scammed.
38,"The team is stressing that even though we are early in the space, these NFTs have real financial impact. Be careful ALWAYS."
