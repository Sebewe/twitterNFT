4,"@dustinduburg @BYOPills I am bullish on @BYOPills and the BYOverse in general. Nonetheless, without any information related to the tokenomics of $TRYP how can we make any serious discussion on potential future token price?"
5,"@BYOPills What I am most excited about is the costant and high quality execution of the team behind the BYOverse. From the initial pills they built a futurist ecosystem, an amazing “virtual” world made of apostles, keys, vapes, land, crafts, $TRYP and so on. “BYOverse, the future is now!”"
