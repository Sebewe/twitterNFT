45,"@zazul_eth With you on fair entry price and tokens being key, but the NFT launch with Token airdropped later is much sexier and easier to sell. Secondary sales of the NFT Passes provide income to the start up that is relative to their success, beautiful though exploitable."
46,"@zazul_eth This seems like a good thing to me, NFT's usurp Kickstarter and Secondary Sales royalty, driven by a promised $token airdrop replaces VC funding. Hundreds of dollars pre beta is excessive, we need to be careful, but I don't hate the direction."
