2,@AltCivilServant I just hate hearing Ukraine is discretionary because they are not NATO.  they are an allie.  Im just disappointed and sad.
3,@InkedKeysha @AltCivilServant Cut the head off the snake 🐍
4,@AltCivilServant Ok. So how does NATO stop Putin?
5,@AltCivilServant @POTUS I disagree.  NATO needs to shut this down.  NOW
6,@no_mo_woe @AltCivilServant @CourtneyRae512 @Angry_Staffer So the reason they are slow is because they are doing their best which is  slow compared to what we'd expect from motha Russia. NATO bomb now
7,@NATO @jensstoltenberg Step it up and remove this dictator
8,@NATO keeps removing my tweets @osf_nft
9,@NATO lets protect our allie. Come on.
10,@no_mo_woe @AltCivilServant @CourtneyRae512 @Angry_Staffer Russia has poor military technology especially compared to the US.  But they have nukes that may or may not work so US cannot put the hammer down unless they are willing to go nuke.
