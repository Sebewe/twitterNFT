6,"@Ntrlsentiment @HollanderAdam @nftworldsNFT Yeah, never even occurred to me to use the first airdrop to buy more worlds, that would then multiply that second airdrop. That seems to have been the big brain play."

31,@GovernorTomWolf It took Venezuela 8 years to go from the richest country in South America to a third world Socialist hell-hole due to rampant corruption leading to hyperinflation ...and this dude wanna talk about 2028. 😂
32,@MrMcRealist0069 @GovernorTomWolf He's actually going backwards with his percentage figures. Told so many lies he can't keep his story straight.
33,@Jenna__law @avsa @nicksdjohnson ENS doesn't even welcome supposed 'squatters' and that's the majority of their base.
34,@AndreCronjeTech Sounds good but you have to also denounce misinterpreted thoughts.

38,"@AminCad @haydenzadams @BrantlyMillegan Man, I considered Hayden a really smart guy. Maybe not as genius as Vitalik, but certainly up there. Pretty disheartening to know he just hears what he wants in a tweet regardless of what it actually says."
39,"@TheCryptoDog @Fitchinverse If a Christian sees someone walking toward eternal damnation and hellfire, obviously they aren't going to root them on. The most loving thing they can do is try to steer them away by sharing the truth. Some people don't wanna hear it, that's expected. Doesn't mean you just quit."
40,@Crypto_Lurker @Fitchinverse @TheCryptoDog Dude keeps saying Brantley called people evil and refuses to read the actual words in the tweet. It's hard to help people like that.

51,@SchalkDormehl @nicksdjohnson @BrantlyMillegan If Nick or whoever wants to interpret Gods word on this topic as hate then they clearly haven't read the first few books of the Bible. I recommend The Bible in a Year podcast w/ FR. Mike Schmitz for a better understanding.

56,"@NauticalHash @spectatorindex Since you work for Amazon, explain to me why I can order a Phanteks Eclipse P300A (in stock) on May 10, have it shipped May 22, and delivered July 17. With Prime. Clearly a scam. No prime refund either."
57,"@NauticalHash @spectatorindex They can offer 30 second shipping, it makes no difference if the package is held for days/weeks/months."
58,@NauticalHash @spectatorindex Lol no they dont
59,@NauticalHash @spectatorindex Lies.
60,"@EminiFTrader @BrianLeeTrades @JamesClear Yeah I've been doing that marbles in a jar thing for completing tasks. 'Cept I use golf tees in a Pirouline can. I try to match or best my previous days record, and track my progress on a bathroom mirror with a dry erase marker."
61,@ShrewdCharlie Too many overly emotional paper-handed gimps with no real trading experience. Basically the NFT markets equivalent of the OTCs 1-Tick Flipper.
