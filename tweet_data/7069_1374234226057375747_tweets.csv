4,@TrailerParkBoyy @awazbaran @TsukiNFT @Worldwide_WEB3 @AsukaNFT Yeah idk wtf happened to the floor smdh.
5,@TheBlazedApe H Town 🤘🚀
6,@CryptoScrax That sucks mate. Sorry to hear. 😒😒😒
7,@drserge If you’re buying above 100 Gwei you’re either crazy or you better be damn sure you’re gonna make it up in profits.
8,@drserge Gas has actually been super cheap recently compared to the shit they were making us pay a month or two ago. Think I paid like 9 bucks on one of my buys.
9,@Cubalicious2 @thetronwars Yeah I’ll bite. Bro I sold dentedfeels at like .24 😅😂
10,@Mitrandir_eth @ChengJia890123 @0xApes_NFT That’s what I’m talking about 😄 https://t.co/NGSpDaVi4P

Chill discord/no shilling.
Organic growth.
Lots of upcoming news.
Thin floor.

12,"@isaac1081_ @themmalos @RocketMan_NFT I hope not.. never bitter to anyone in the nft space. Personally I wouldn’t buy in right now, but for holders sake I hope the thing keeps fucking mooning. 🙏🚀"
13,@themmalos @RocketMan_NFT Ooffff. Risky.
14,@cryptochungus_ https://t.co/cqmMkB2YSN
15,@Gritty_Hustler Yeah but you can destroy your portfolio with like 10 sets in a row and if that next one hits it doesn’t matter. That’s what keeps you coming back 😂
16,@THEGOONEEZ Can’t believe people are still dumping eth into that project.
17,@Gritty_Hustler Oh that’s not so bad mate. They’ll bounce back. Not sure about these nft buys 😂
18,@Gritty_Hustler What did you buy?
19,@Gritty_Hustler BRUHHHH. Decimated over here also. 😆😂
20,@cryptochungus_ Lmk what you’re minting next. Maybe those skills will rub off on a moonshot.
21,@PuffYatty I have no room to criticize.. my high school art teacher who always said “there’s no such thing as bad art” made a massive exception for me and I’ll never forget it. 🤡
22,RT @DocBrownLloyd: This is my Step-son’s @BoredApeYC NFT…he has been educating me on the space recently. I find the technology &amp; culture be…
23,@msloditskie @cryptomanran Bruh 😂🤠
24,@CryptoSkooby @0xApes_NFT @DegenToonz @DentedFeelsNFT I’m still over here trying to sell my fucking 0xape suit. It’s literally listed at like half the floor price lol
25,"@CryptoSkooby @0xApes_NFT @DegenToonz @DentedFeelsNFT I agree! Good pick up for sure. Cliche to say that I would’ve bought had I known about it.. but at mint price, and the way they look I’m fairly certain I would’ve got a couple. Floor is picking back up for you as well. 🚀"
26,@CryptoSkooby @0xApes_NFT @DegenToonz Idk where the fuck I was at. I defo missed a gem. Looking at @DentedFeelsNFT too.
27,"@CryptoSkooby I’m holding about 3 of you @0xApes_NFT accountable for not shilling me @DegenToonz …thought we were looking out for one another in this community, ser! 😂😂"
28,"Stop bidding on my shit.. do you want it or not, ser? 😆🤷‍♂️"
29,@melvin_deva The disrespect. At least when I bid I give em something to think about.. 😄
30,@melvin_deva Well if someone accepts that nonsense then I guess the bidder deserves it just for that.
31,@melvin_deva I got the same one.. *why yes I’d love to sell you my item at a 50 percent discount in an already down set*

38,@apriil_rose @Mfer_Chicks I have one but it’s different material! 😂 they’re vibes for sure.
39,@MitchellBored @TheMauiWowi @3landersNFT @DentedFeelsNFT Definitely a collection where every item looks fucking dope for sure.
40,@apriil_rose @Mfer_Chicks Just because of the hood.. this one wins! 🤝🎯

44,@BluebirdX11 I know a lot of people stick their nose up at derivative sets.. but tbh the @0xApes_NFT community is the best community I’ve been part of so far. And that includes communities of  1-2 eth sets that I’ve been in.
45,@benoitbrouilla2 WHAT UPPPPP
46,@BiggsCrypto They’re not. Most project are hyped for about a month or so then when the volume dies off a new project comes out and they switch to that.

54,@Cubalicious2 @TsukiNFT .05 first how has it dumped that bad and second who the hell keeps listing for like $200 and less.. 🤷‍♂️😅
55,Anyone else holding @TsukiNFT? Wtf happened to that floor…
56,@itstylersays @TsukiNFT Also got kicked out of discord for telling a buyer who was waiting for price to drop that the price had already dropped. 🤷‍♂️😂 https://t.co/JqGjlG6su0
57,@itstylersays Bought @TsukiNFT and that worked out great 👎👎👎
58,@1202reklaW literally everything i buy tanks. 😅
59,@TsukiNFT @SixthReseau Would be cool if I didn’t get banned from your discord for no reason.
60,@7Chriscrowe7 @Pixelmon @thetronwars A lot of garbage takes off because of Twitter hype and fomo tbh man.
61,@AlyssaMetaverse Really? 😅
62,@jslozzy @TsukiNFT @AsukaNFT The discord situation? Cheers man.. yeah no point me holding mine if I dunno what’s going on lol.
63,@BiggsCrypto Apparently it’s enough to pump a nothing project into a something project though.
64,@jslozzy @TsukiNFT @AsukaNFT I screenshot what they said and my response to it that got me kicked. https://t.co/VADcpZXJ0A
65,@jslozzy @TsukiNFT @AsukaNFT Same as my Twitter handle. Parabholic.eth
66,@jslozzy @TsukiNFT @AsukaNFT Right.. confused about a lot of it. Bought one for .29 in the week when they were running up and then bought 2 more last night for .13 and it’s tanked even further. Not to mention got kicked out of discord for absolutely no reason.. 🤷‍♂️
67,@jslozzy @TsukiNFT @AsukaNFT Floor took a bit of a beating
68,@BlountJesse @0xApes_NFT 3T gang gang gang. https://t.co/54soQvvT1f

70,@Albrtfs @0xApes_NFT Been trying to offload my suit for like 2 weeks but no one’s buying em. Don’t get why. There’s only 2 under 2.5 eth.
71,@0xGroovy @0xApeMfers I have like 15 of those things lol
72,@boostOnTheBrain @TsukiNFT Floor dump is a little concerning considering where I bought though lol
73,@NevadaIndica @TsukiNFT lol i think the mod misunderstood my response.. oh well fuck it. i shouldve gone out with a bang like you did.. 😄
74,"@NevadaIndica @TsukiNFT Literally this.. 

Someone said they’ll buy the price drop after reveal and I told em they price has already dropped (implying you can buy now) https://t.co/ATNQeBTPpY"
75,@NevadaIndica @TsukiNFT i got banned also.. 😅🤷‍♂️
76,@nftsteven1009 @0xApes_NFT https://t.co/O3xT9CFVwv
77,@Cubalicious2 @TsukiNFT Bro someone said some shit about floor is gonna drop after reveal so might pick one up.. and I said “floors dropped a bunch already” and I got a “#floor chat” response and then totally booted. What a joke 🤷‍♂️😂
78,@drserge You’ve been saying it since the end of last summer too basically.
79,@itsdanataylor Snap! 🔥

96,@BasedDaddyDemon Secured. 🎯
97,@btown_p @scoobydrewwww I need to try and jump on these early. There’s so many collections that no one talks about and then all of a sudden it’s all over Twitter and the price goes crazy.
98,"@scoobydrewwww I showed my gf mfers (who knows absolutely nothing about NFTs) and her immediate response was, “they’ve been drawing those for years, now y’all wanna pay tens of thousands for em..?!” 😂😂😂"
99,@HiStargazer @DiscoverXnft @apemfers I have like 15 of these lol.
