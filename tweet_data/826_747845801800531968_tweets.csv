1,Massive congratulations to @BunnyKnights on the Gen 2 drop. The mint portal website was brilliant. Excited for the reveal tomorrow and the next chapter in this OG @tezos project. https://t.co/rGELBGhCKJ https://t.co/5QTUG7ms5D
2,@NFTignition Everything that has traits has rarity on OS but I guess they mean they wont sign up with rarity tools or similar to create a rarity league table.
3,@theycallmeshwaz @Pixelmon I really didn’t think these were real at first but have just seen a load on the TL. Wow. Very good project name but looks like that was about it.

7,@bitcoinski @props You telling me I spent all that time learning solidity…. For nothing. 😂. Only joking but this does look awesome mate. Great work.
8,"@sxtvik Hey mate, don’t forget us over at Wavelength. Community is awesome!"

11,"@toball @ParallelNFT @illuviumio @ClementinesGame @missingfrontier Yeah for sure. I think they just went about it wrong, making people grind so hard but does seem that gaming will go that way. Eventually"
12,"@toball @ParallelNFT @illuviumio @ClementinesGame Interesting that Ubisoft tried this, with ghost recon I believe, and got a lot of backlash. Looks like they have switched to investing in nft gaming projects like @missingfrontier now."

17,@StueyFresh @WavelengthSales Your collection is amazing with such a range of styles. With everything going on it’s always so nice to actually sit for a min and have a look at Wavelengths.  I know I’m biased but I think @KalebsCode managed to pull off something real special with these.
18,@jlindsayfilm @whoosh_labs Thanks Judy! Thought it made sense to make things a bit easier to manage. I’ll be opening up the discord again in the next few days if you want to jump in!

28,RT @KalebsCode: @georgefatlion who are you
29,@KalebsCode Wow no acknowledgement on it here… I see how it is. 😂
30,@seanelliottoc @BanklessHQ Ah will give it a listen. Thanks.
31,"@seanelliottoc Ha yes I know mate, but I had to tag them as I think they are the only people who could do it. Just went on a bit of a blocking spree. Hope all good your side!"
32,That way no currency or NFTs could be transfered out without confirming on your hardware wallet but you could still gain access to holders sections of project websites using the hot wallet. @Ledger @MetaMask  is this possible? 4/4
33,"My solution is hardware wallets should be able to link to/assign a single hot wallet and enable it to sign a subset of transactions, for example just read only messages for example to prove they own a specific NFT. 3/4"
34,The problem with this is they can’t sign messages to enter holders sections of project’s sites or use services like collab land. Often they have to waste gas transferring to a hot wallet and back again to claim presale list or login somewhere.  2/4
35,"I’ve been thinking a bit about NFT security and hardware wallets. Many people, rightly, have a vault hardware wallet to store their collection and crypto but also have a policy of never connecting the hardware wallet to any website or dapp. 1/4"

63,@CozomoMedici My 2 cents is that in a world where you can create literally anything then derivatives and copycats that are very close to the original feel a bit lazy.
