9,"2/ Building, managing, and marketing a project organically is no easy task, and it takes a ton of energy. As such, my thread game has suffered slightly; but the delta is net positive. 

I truly believe that this brand could shape how fashion and web3 intersect forever."
10,"1/ UPDATE on ME!:
Lately I have been very busy building my own NFT brand, @TheGoomies. It is a labor of love and I want to make sure I am doing this right, in order to optimize for longevity.

25,"It’s crazy to me how many people will reject the idea of NFTs without offering it a second thought. 

We are not far at all into the adoption curve. Despite the celebrity involvement, this space is still small, and has a long way to go.

79,"9/ I know this one was pretty to the point, but I put it together just now, because I felt that it could help some people.

Thanks a ton for reading, as always. I really do appreciate it as I try and grow more on here.

Much love, 
- dawg 🌙"
80,"8/ My point is:

You are not GMI by reflecting on what could have been. You are GMI by planning your next move and executing. 

Make the most of what you have, as well as being early in this amazing space."
81,"7/ So, is taking early profits on $ENS one of those moments? 

Well, that’s up to you."
82,"6/ Sure, we will not be in a NFT bear market for every project like in the ENS example; but that isn’t the point.

The point is that in reality, there are some cases where taking your profits early to make a calculated OTHER play is actually the lower opportunity cost option."
83,"5/ It doesn’t matter what you sold your $ENS for - you have more LIQUIDITY now!

Go buy that blue chip you couldn’t afford last week, or that DAO you’ve been wanting to get into.

You may be able to afford it now; and it may make you a killing in the future. 

Look forward!"
84,"4/ I remember seeing hundreds of tweets on a daily basis, not even a week ago, saying things like:

“I wish I had kept enough liquidity for this NFT bear market” 

and 

“If only I had the money to buy those low priced ____!”

Well, boy do I have news for you."
85,"3/ It is natural to be mad when you sold for X worth in the past, but you could have sold for X * 2 worth in the present. 

Take a step back and evaluate, though.

Example:
Let’s look at the $ENS situation.

What were the tweets that everyone was making before this ENS drop?"
86,"2/ In this space, we take money we have, invest it, grow it, and repeat until we make it.

This is the common goal amongst most who you see in this space talking about this or that project.

So you bought a token, it grew, you sold, then it REALLY grew. I’m sure you’re annoyed."
87,"1/ I want to start by mentioning that $ENS aside, this thread is meant to help ANYONE who “could have made more” if they hadn’t sold early. 

By design, it is applicable to any case.

For the most part, just replace “ENS” with whatever project you sold early.

Let’s begin"
88,"🧵 [THREAD] 🧵 
Perspective in The Blockchain Space

Recent events with $ENS have me thinking. I am seeing a lot of early sellers dwelling.

This is a pattern in this space.

I’m here to say that I have been there, and I want to offer some needed perspective.

89,"@MayFirexx I'll probably give it a try, but yes - I was hoping for a cosmetic feature, too."
90,@ETHDougBlrdd @ensdomains I’ll have to get back to you on that! Not too sure hah.
91,"Any opinions on whether Twitter Blue is worth it? 

$3 seems totally fair."
92,"@ETHDougBlrdd Follow the sentiment! ENS is Ethereum name service. They are domains, such as moondog.eth.

@ensdomains did an airdrop of their token. I would recommend taking a peek on dextools if you wanted to gauge whether you’d like to get in or not!"
93,"@Hobojo86 @beaniemaxi @punk6529 No - unfortunately the higher value they are the more memory they take up, so you can only fit a few at this point 😞"

95,"@rhymeten Quite high indeed, in my opinion. Could be a little bit like Uniswap, which fell before it popped up to where it is now."

If yes, will you buy back in?"
