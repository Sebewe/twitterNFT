9,"@iamDCinvestor High incentives make it hard to discern whether a product has good fit in the market. 

But this model has been in existence for a long time in our web2 world for a long time."
10,@iamDCinvestor I go back and forth on this as there are pros and cons to incentivizing usage with a platforms native token.

28,"Another way that projects manage their treasuries is purely through smart contracts.

Smart contracts limit the flexibility in how funds can be used but are trustless because the funds can only be used for the programmed purpose."
29,"Multisig wallets also offer wider flexibility than smart contracts in allowing projects to direct funds.

However, the main drawback of multisig wallets is that communities have to trust the majority of the signers."
30,"What is a multisig?

Simply, a multisig is a wallet with multiple signers.

Because this is more secure than having a single signer, a lot of projects use multisigs to manage their treasuries."
31,"Two common ways project treasuries are managed:

1) multisig wallets
2) smart contracts"
32,What are the benefits and drawbacks of the common ways project treasuries are managed? A short🧵👇
33,@lightnode @Boring_Crypto @joincolony will check it out :)
34,@Boring_Crypto This is a problem that I think about often and for many projects is not an easy one to solve. Short term improvements will likely come from better DAO tooling. We need more efficient ways for DAO members to manage treasuries directly without relying on multsigs
35,@dcfgod @alphaketchum @danielesesta @jai_bhavnani @StaniKulechov @ohmzeus @bantg @joey__santoro @scupytrooples A good start would be for projects to list all multisigs in an easy to find place (similar to how projects link to their contracts) As well as listing out signers for each multisig wallet
36,@NFTethics Definitely worth a read here - alignment in NFT projects shouldn't be understated
37,@bryanbrinkman @allnick What about ETH themed projects?
38,100% this. Levels of decentralization live on a spectrum and are not binary. Decentralized competitors to centralized services are also up and coming. Our goal should simply be to move further out on the decentralization curve over time https://t.co/14B7i9jNxR

Not mentioned so far are 1. the sheer number of integrations that $stETH has in the defi ecosystem and 2. the sustainability of the tokenomics of the $LDO token. While @LidoFinance is already the de facto leader, all of the above reasons point to their continued success"

DAO first. @LidoFinance is built off of @AragonProject and is one of the few projects that were ambitious enough to fully launch as a DAO. Launching a protocol of this magnitude with no ""real-world"" entity is not easy and it really speaks to the philosophy of the founders."

Liquidity. $stETH is far and away the most liquid token amongst liquid staking providers. There is over 1.2mm ETH of TVL within the ETH/stETH pool on @CurveFinance. Plus the pool is very ""balanced"". (51% stETH) https://t.co/uqAqCOz7bp"

Firstly, LIDO is a juggernaut in the space. Based on this Dune dashboard by @eliasimos, they currently have an 89% marketshare amongst liquid staking solutions. (Higher if you exclude Stakehound, since this ETH is in purgatory☹️)
