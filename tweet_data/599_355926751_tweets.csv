38,@tropoFarmer @KGeorgee @WAX_io @mooncatrescue Must have been a hustle to do that with street fighter.  My first wax project was GBK and was much easier money than SF lol.
39,"@snowballx_ @BoredApeYC So cool, happy birthday."
40,"@ArtifactNFT My advice would be to store anything good that you are keeping long term on a hardware wallet, and just keep small liquidity for buying and selling or minting on your metamask wallet, or several metamask wallets."
41,"@ArtifactNFT Or have seen people lose by doing a screen share and re-setting up their metamask while someone is watching.  I also don't share my screen with anyone, or would never let a support person have access to my computer."
42,"@ArtifactNFT It is on your computer, so as long as nobody has access to your computer then you are good.  I always just disconnect my computer from the internet if I'm not using it.   Most people get hacked by entering their seed phrase into a site."
43,"@ArtifactNFT Because it is local to your computer,  not a site you are logging into."

58,"@aGreatChef @TheeHustleHouse @PORK1984 Wow, nice one."
59,"@AntonioBorzacch @SorareHQ Maybe a drop initially.  In the long run, I think the new scarcity will bring in more managers that will enjoy playing and move their way up into the higher scarcities for better rewards.  I think it is good for the game overall."
60,New Scarcity and hopefully lower point of entry so more fans can play.  Could be really big for @SorareHQ https://t.co/ISkqqwVVSX
61,"@ASilvaNZ1 @SorareHQ Yeah,  it's hard for me to call it football.  I see what you are saying.  Mark Cuban talked about that with Dallas Mavericks tickets being released as NFTs, then having highlights or something from the game attached afterwards.  Pretty exciting stuff."
