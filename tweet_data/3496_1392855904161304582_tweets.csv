0,If you haven’t checked out @ChubbyKaijuDAO it is one of the best projects I have invested in. @JAMPZER is a true leader and the community rallies behind him. This isn’t a flip y’all https://t.co/eksB6k0mIv
1,@JAMPZER @CoCreator369 Underinvested
2,RT @robbyhammz: @iwwon_official hop in we need your voice  https://t.co/IegRM5FVti
3,"@MorganStoneee Whatever is beyond being ratioed, then that is what happened. Love to see it"
4,"@wokkrr Stealth mint, sold out in 3 minutes…..bottled af"
5,"@greg16676935420 There is nothing better then to offload shit projects. That’s when I know the bull is back,until then….I diamond hand my IreneDAO"
6,Missed the 3landers pump because it’s so damn hard to keep ETH in my wallet
7,@basedkarbon Live look at Davis buying tubbycats https://t.co/CkuDPIYciu
8,@DiscoverXnft I am underinvested
9,@cryptoein Max pain
10,@kodaksh_nft Neither
11,@DiscoverXnft We all actually have a psychosis. The shift from extreme fear to extreme euphoria is incredible
12,@DiscoverXnft Deliberately not touching OS today
13,I am a little confused by so many people saying all OS listings will be delisted today and that is bullish. Did I miss something or if we migrated our listings over are they not still listed?
14,"At this point, if you just aped every mfer derivative you would be killing it"
15,@cryptopeerani1 @quirkiesnft Comfy https://t.co/ZLtjS5fAs5
16,@QuirkiesBot @quirkiesnft Woooooow
17,"@itstylersays Agreed, everyone selling about to get rekt!"
18,If you are in great projects….why would you sell now? Stop trying to time the market
19,I realize NFTs are priced in ETH but I feel oddly safe with my NFTs while traditional investments and cryptocurrencies nuke. Probably not rationale but love the communities I am in
20,@CozomoMedici @CozomoMedic Hmmm how do I pronounce that….
21,Sub 2k ETH incoming
22,@smcanale @InvsblePets @InvsbleFriends But it has over 3k organic likes….
23,@KeyboardMonkey3 @0x650d Down bad
24,He has spoken! Completely rekt on Bloot but at least this will ease the pain https://t.co/avVohY1E44
25,"I swear do the same people who made squiggles, hypebears, etc all work on the same team? Same damn marketing tactics and we know how it ends https://t.co/KizUufyMAx"
26,@DiscoverXnft Someone bought for 18!
27,@DiscoverXnft And we thought simp DAOs were the top
28,@OGDfarmer @KeyboardMonkey3 But ser he operates on LTFs….HTFs aren’t his thing
29,@DiscoverXnft @tubbycatsnft Damnit now you are going to make me switch to my tubby too
30,"@__proper Literally bought the punk top, ok maybe a few weeks early but dang. gg"
31,@OttoSuwenNFT @MoonOverlord One of the most obvious plays I have seen in awhile
32,"Not much time left, if you have the liquidity I wouldn’t fade. Much bigger r/r then most projects out there. OS floor is glitchy, floor is around .8"
33,@Pentosh1 Love to see it
34,@BelfortNFT Tbh it’s worse. They had all eyes on them for months and all they had to do was give the ball to Marshawn
35,@jjpplll Invisible mfers
36,@basedkarbon Does she not understand this is a once in a lifetime Tubby dip?
37,@basedkarbon Couldn’t be me
38,@DiscoverXnft But this time is different….
39,@fOOnyuns @invisibleMfers LFG!!!
40,wen invisible mfers? I will mint the shit out of that just to bury my cope
41,"@hunterorrell Your right, you should do a giveaway"
42,@rexwub Good to know not everyone is just buying IF with their spare 10 eth
43,One of the funniest things I saw today was people panicking to gather enough liquidity to buy an IF. Most were so confident that 2-4 eth would be enough.....oops
44,When you get out traded by a 13 yr old https://t.co/9jV9vaT8CU https://t.co/ZO0fA51qT8
45,372 IF sales in the last hour at around 10 eth. Man I must be poor
46,@rexwub Buy the dip! Or yeah but my rewards make up for my buy at $5
47,@Helloimmorgan Hold until reveal then when it tanks just tell yourself it will go up eventually and then when it gets so low sell it for .5 ETH so you can say you doubled your money 💰
48,@Blackmamba_559 @CodyABanks @InvsbleFriends I gotta know what you had to do to get on that WL
49,What is ya doing buying invisible friends at 12 ETH. What people will do to scalp a quick ETH…..then panic sell at a 2 ETH loss once it dips below 10
50,@robbyhammz Honestly where is the upside when it is already at 12 ETH. I feel like it will bounce around 8-10
51,Y’all need to learn from the last bear season. If you would have bid on great teams in October-November and rode the December-January bull y’all would be up BIG if you took profits
52,@allthegwei @StarcatchersNFT @ethmaurice Love how you threw Snoop Dogg in there too
53,Can someone tell me how hard they had to simp for an invisible friends WL? Idk man I would do a lot for an instant 12 ETH
54,I have been piling into NFTs with price points &lt; .2 and have a strong community. Those floors will see the most stability during this down season and will do extremely well on the next bull run. This is not the market to FOMO
55,@rexwub Sentiment feels very similar to October....was a fun few down months
56,@basedkarbon math checks out
57,@hunterorrell The floor on these things pre reveal is going to compete with Meka. Insanity
58,@TerminatusX The benefits of staying liquid
59,"@DiscoverXnft Nice work, how many do you have now?"
60,and y'all complain about WL....Be careful what you wish for. Gas wars are thee worst imo https://t.co/0BA1Zmq4nw
61,@basedkarbon But ser what if I am poor and used all my savings to buy one lone Tubbycat....
62,"@DiscoverXnft You mean not selling the top, but racing to the sell the absolute bottom before the floor stabilizes back up isn't smart?"
63,I would not fade tubby cats. If you can get your hands on one sub 1 eth you will not regret it https://t.co/NdTgIgeT8y
64,"@ChubbyKaijuDAO is easily one of the more underrated projects. The only way to understand is by joining the discord and researching all the amazing things being developed in record time. This is a long term winner, not a quick flip https://t.co/Q9EQEVzNnK"
65,"@DiscoverXnft welp, did you get your second Tubby?"
66,@DiscoverXnft Yesssss https://t.co/sVOH0HPYcx
67,Absolutely love this art. Come join the community if it resonates with you as well https://t.co/WO3xLvExUh
68,"RT @tp_x2y2: 1/n

We've got the audit and had it uploaded here https://t.co/suyPtAVCfn 

tl;dr https://t.co/0mUdDR1thh"
69,"@ABigThingBadly @grantpat @3landersNFT Same, can't decide if I want to ape or not"
70,@rexwub As long as JPEGS go up we good. Once there is no where to run from the bear market is when this space will get ugly
71,One of the most overused phrases rn is “it costs zero ETH to be kind” or something to that effect. Its starting to feel fake and classic engagement farming. It costs zero ETH to be original
72,"@OGDfarmer What do you mean, we just like tubby cats https://t.co/kfIWUvN4qq"
73,"@337Xenos @DataNFT_ Correct, too soon"
74,@DataNFT_ @CryptoMories @BossBeautiesNFT Don’t forget @ShadesOfYouNFT. Incredible art and at current FP I would say it’s the definition of a sale https://t.co/609CylEqIv
75,@MRMILLI0NAIRE You already know https://t.co/xNJtQnFrOZ
76,@337Xenos @DataNFT_ People have tried many times in crypto to make insurance a thing. It’s just not sustainable. Way too many ways to commit insurance fraud and way too many hacks. This space would have to be heavily regulated before that would work
77,Why 👏🏽 do 👏🏽 people 👏🏽 think 👏🏽 they 👏🏽 deserve 👏🏽 3M+ 👏🏽 from 👏🏽 us 👏🏽 https://t.co/zZ3e6fsBqz
78,@DomKro86 @ShadesOfYouNFT for sure. Absolutely stunning collection https://t.co/RqeAtjnWyp
79,"@MychalSimka @the_x2y2 @LooksRareNFT @opensea Agreed, much better and sustainable reward system. But let the haters keep hating while I stack"
80,@eminnisa_ @tubbycatsnft 1/1 for sure
81,@ChunkyGerbil @OttoSuwenNFT Never fade the narrative. Learned that lesson time and time again
82,@DataNFT_ I don’t see how that would be sustainable with the amount of hacks that occur
83,@DiscoverXnft Pump my bags 🤝
84,@DiscoverXnft My dude when all the influencers are shilling them you ape and ask questions later
85,@NateAlexNFT Clean af
86,@NateAlexNFT Unfortunately that seems to be about 50% (generous?) of people in the space rn. Good thing I am in it for the art!
87,@NateAlexNFT I mean how clueless are we talking here?
88,@OttoSuwenNFT @tubbycatsnft Had to scoop mine from @the_x2y2 marketplace. Sales were too insane on OS
89,Soooo I guess we like the @tubbycatsnft https://t.co/8D8aii3fXT
90,"@DiscoverXnft Ouch man, I would have done the same. You would have thought there would be a pullback but never underestimate degens"
91,"Its really sad to see tons of discord communities posting misinformation about the OS phishing attack in their announcements. I understand trying to protect the community quickly, but then you need to make updates quickly as the situation unfolds"
92,@DataNFT_ Phishing email that made people believe they were migrating their listings. A lot of misinformation out there though
93,"RT @Tree_of_Alpha: Coinbase's ""largest-ever bug bounty""

How a flaw in the new Advanced Trading feature would have allowed a malicious user…"
94,Honestly for how much people want to just throw shade at X2Y2 it is going to be my platform of choice moving forward. Stop trying to pump your LOOKS bags. There is enough room for multiple players in this space
95,"@Versuhtyle @ABigThingBadly No shit, people were so ready to drag X2Y2 for absolutely nothing"
96,More details on the OS exploit. Makes sense this person would want to do this before the migration occurs https://t.co/Q1goWmyXEf
97,@OddOneEth @OttoSuwenNFT He already said he misspoke
98,@Vince_Van_Dough This isn't accurate he already said he misspoke and this is purely an OS issue. Has to do with their migration contract
99,@OttoSuwenNFT Please don't spread misinformation. This has nothing to do with X2Y2 and I haven't heard from one credible source that X2Y2 has been exploited. If there is an exploit its only OS
