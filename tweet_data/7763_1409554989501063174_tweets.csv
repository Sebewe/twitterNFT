39,@GingerBeloved @CozomoMedici @BigGreenRob @jennifercreador @BreDonofrio Nothing is nice but have you heard of Absolutely Nothing?
40,@shanedotleonard @deekaymotion @CozomoMedici Do you have Absolutely Nothing?
41,"RT @eToroUS: We brought a friend to the big game, did you spot him in our commercial? #apefollowape @BoredApeYC

🤔Drop your guesses below.🤔…"
42,Don't send absolutely nothing to Rex416.eth
43,"The choice is yours.

I'll be waiting inside my apartment.

Casually browsing gates.

Getting ready to spend your ETH.

So thank you.

For absolutely nothing. 

;) ~Rex416"
44,"So remember:

No NFT.

No rarity traits.

No devs that can rug you.

No spammy discord.

Tbh, we just need a new gate for the cottage.

So we are sending the bill to you, the community.

And you're very welcome!"
45,"Though let me make myself clear:

With this current Project, @CozomoMedici also gets nothing."
46,"But in few months, I will be releasing Project Absolutely Nothing v69, and at that time I will be dumping more nothing on you.

Though with that, afterwards, I plan to make a donation to @CozomoMedici."
47,"Now, I know right about now, you are probably asking 

""How can I get access to Project Absolutely Nothing""?

Well unfortunately, I have bad news for you.

There is no whitelist.

There is not even an allow list."
48,"But don't come a knockin'...

For Project Absolutely Nothing also includes no utility.

No visits.

No dinner at any table.

But, you do get to say you were a part of this revolutionary Project. 

And remember

It's not ""probably nothing"".

It's ""absolutely nothing""."
49,"Once the funds are sent, you will receive no response.

There is no treasury.

I will be using all funds to pay for the new side gate for the cottage

If enough ETH is received, we may even buy a front gate. https://t.co/iiI8iNpD3K"
50,"Now, the min amount of ETH you can send to get Project Absolutely Nothing, is 0 ETH.

Anything else would be an insult."
51,"Wen token?

Go buy another token, and pretend it's for this."
52,"Want a discord? 

Too bad. Nobody will build it.

Want to make new frens?

Good luck. There is no community."
53,"You get nothing.

There is no roadmap.

There is no utility.

There absolutely isn't an NFT."
54,"Project Absolutely Nothing.

The way it works is simple:

There is no mint.

You will send ETH directly to me.

And that's when the differentiation begins.

Because afterwards..."
55,"For months, no one has asked,

""Wen Rex416 NFT?""

No one has tried to ride the Rex416 name

We've decided to stay silent.

In the shadows.

But quietly building.

And that's why I am thrilled to announce..."
56,"At long last, after very much debate, we've decided to release a Rex416 Project!

A short thread on how and why we've decided to monetize, and what this means for you, the community, and the future of NFT🧵👇"
57,@CozomoMedici I promised a lot less.  I can send this gate if you want! https://t.co/9sR93SDOOY
