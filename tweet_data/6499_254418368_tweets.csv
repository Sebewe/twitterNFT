https://t.co/3RWkq8njIA https://t.co/f5F4cszSmq"
59,"thanks for taking a lil dive into my brain.

ready to continue my web3 adventures by sharing “over u” with everyone this thursday on @soundxyz_ 😘🖤"
60,"when drawing and designing my cover arts i use a program called Procreate on my ipad.

similar to writing songs, i’ll sketch without much thought until something clicks. 

when i’ve mapped out the picture in pencil i’ll trace it with an inking tool, then color, then shading."
61,"once i’ve got a song i love completely stripped down i will send vocals to one of my producer homies (usually @iamtarro). 

he builds the music up around my vocal so everything is tailored to the song. and boom, we’ve got a classic 👨‍🍳🤌"
62,"i mix the song as i record it then pass it off to my engineer when it’s final.

sometimes i feel like i’m painting a picture with my adlibs and back up vocals/harmonies. the way those vocals are processed can change the whole feeling of a song."
63,"i write to just guitar so i know the song holds up on its own. 

i almost never write anything down when im by myself. i just freestyle melodies on the mic and carve out sections i like. 

once i’ve got a good hook i’ll come up w lyrics in my head and plug them in as they hit me."
64,"the way i create music always varies depending on where i am and who i’m with. 

when i’m in the room with others i’ll write in my phone and sing out loud to include everyone. 

but in this case with “over u” i was by myself in my room."
65,"gm. 

before “over u” debuts on @soundxyz_ this Thursday i wanna bring u guys in on my creative process for my records and cover arts."
