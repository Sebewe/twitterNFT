54,"I'm super grateful that @jubbishjay trusted us enough to give this a shot. It was risky to do something different, but I really believe collective ownership will become the standard going forward."
55,"There aren't any weird games around edition numbers or rarity, the rarity is in the piece. Everyone who owns a fraction is excited about owning a part of the larger whole. Its about owning a piece TOGETHER instead of owning a smaller copy."
56,"This feels like a win win AND it preserves scarcity for the artist. If a big collector does come through and buys out the vault, fraction owners get compensated and can use those funds to buy the next fractionalized piece from the artist."
57,the low price per fraction allowed for more users to collect a piece from an artist they love. BUT this doesn't preclude a big collector who's really excited about a piece from buying it in its entirety at a premium.
58,"It was also interesting watching sales

I noticed many fellow artists and photographers picking up fractions. Most often you see big collectors buying a 1/1 piece after an auction. Collective ownership through fractions allows peers to support each other just as effectively."
59,"- image resolution of the fractions was really low on OS (fixed and will be improved further)
- 1155 vaults include contract token id in the title, this doesn't look great (in progress)
- we need to figure out royalties for artists (in progress)
- lots of other small improvements"
60,"On the product side, this was the first time we've seen an artist fractionalize their 1/1 for initial distribution. Thanks to Jay for trusting us. We learned a lot and are working on updates:
- Listing fractions on OS can be confusing, tedious, and expensive (in progress)"
61,"wanted to put together some thoughts on @jubbishjay's most recent drop with @fractional_art. Jay fractionalized his 1/1 NFT Elysian Fields into 100 fractions, and listed those fractions for sale on OS.
