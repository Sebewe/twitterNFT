65,"@cult_leader_en @rae_kwak_ @jocelyntypes @web3baddies web3 nomenclature has been a topic i've mentioned and interestingly been shot down in certain circles 🙄 

some may perceive a name as ""trivial"" but copywriting in design is one of the most important aspects of accessibility! like ""portal"" and am glad this convo is happening"
66,@EmmaBWaldron :(( and that's why we do ~contactless~ delivery
67,"If you’d like to find out: 
- more about what Tonari is doing, 
- collaborate with our studio, 
- perhaps see your own original character appear in our anime series
 
Follow @SecondSelfNFT &amp; stay tuned for our upcoming mint this month!!"
68,"Tonari’s professional quality has benefited the traditional media system too long; this is their first foray into web3.

The smol team has always actively worked to improve conditions for creatives, even at their own expense. These are the types of teams we should be supporting!"
69,"But community values, shared visions, new frontiers are what makes this space so special. 

As the line between creator/consumer becomes blurred, we must recognize the unique opportunities that occur as a result. 

And lean into our power to remake systems that never served us!! https://t.co/XkblFaUzXI"
70,"Point is: We all know this NFT market isn’t going to pump forever. Many, many projects will run to 0.

Buzzwords, roadmaps, lookin’ rare--no longer enough to guarantee a project’s success w/ the ease of counterfeits."
71,"Over 4x the expected energy consumption of this collection will be returned into the soil via safe, sustainable pastoral grazing practices.

With the series taking place in a disaster-adapted Earth, it would be incredibly remiss to ignore this aspect.

https://t.co/zQUbEl5H3a"
72,"Additionally--w/ mainnet as the platform choice for better accessibility, Tonari has pre-allocated a portion of sales to go carbon-negative on this project! 

We’ve committed to funding soil carbon sequestration in a partnership with Native. Largely inspired by our anime setting"
73,"They also empower their community with additional free educational resources, like the Sakuga Foundry and Tonari Youtube channel. 

Something smells good… like decentralization of creative careers 😛
https://t.co/P2x1hTzi07"
74,"Without ownership, we are all just sitting ducks in the hands of our paycheck writer. 

A boss will always pay you enough to be satisfied, but never enough to be independent. Creative industries in third world countries are close to dying out as a result of these practices."
75,"Sweatshop conditions aren’t just for factory workers, it applies to highly talented creatives too. 

Network influence from first-world countries offering a “living wage” for their creatives in the Philippines turns out to be less than $6/hr for incredibly advanced skills 😵‍💫"
76,"Following this path will take us back into web2 centralization territory. 
Is this the future we want to reinvent? https://t.co/uBKaJPLiKR"
77,"This has simply been ~the standard~ for many years, and will continue to be unless we intentionally go about web3. 

There’s a lot of noise in this ecosystem, absolutely, but we cannot continue to rely on signals from big brands and influencers in a speculative manner."
78,"Brands and larger companies will literally capitalize an entire country's creative industry--sucking all talent into an exploitative funnel,

Where native artists are forced to compete against each other in a race to the bottom to execute ideas from first-world countries. https://t.co/h8zBoZ2CcY"
