6,"@GolemZGuard @_benxit_ @beaniemaxi Launches in march. Graded and authenticated collectibles , trading in real time on the blockchain. Polygon of course so no gas."
7,@_benxit_ @beaniemaxi @GolemZGuard This is a new marketplace for buying and selling physical collectibles like sports cards and comic books.
8,@_benxit_ @beaniemaxi @GolemZGuard No but project looks interesting.

11,Who’s interested in hearing about a new project mints nfts in place of physical collectibles? https://t.co/gWakVg9wLT
12,@beaniemaxi Because no one has been convinced that the juice is worth the squeeze yet. Play to earn is just as much about owning the experience as it is the ecosystem/assets. These “defi with pictures” games will never create a relationship with the user and game theory does not equal gaming

74,@cas3333333 @economist @beaniemaxi I meant about the creativity stifling….there’s plenty of examples in Jordan’s history of butting heads with Nike… and converse…not even sure why they are in the discussion when was the last time someone looked at a converse shoe and said now that’s creative…
75,@cas3333333 @economist @beaniemaxi Im sure @economist can answer this one more eloquently than I
76,"@economist @beaniemaxi 3

I’m also very suspicious of these rumors that rare clones were earmarked for certain people and wallets. Wondering if rtfkt team did this thinking hay was in the barn for the acquisition or worse…used influencers and funding to get them over the finish line with Nike"
77,"@economist @beaniemaxi 2

Creatively speaking rtfkt just became a Nike sneaker creator, I also wouldn’t count on Nike upholding any of the promises the rtfkt team made to buyers which was one of the big reasons a lot of ppl bought thinking about future drops."
78,"@economist @beaniemaxi 1

My thoughts are sell now while there are buyers and hype

The move seems obvious, Nike was getting Dickslapped by adidas, and rtfkt is being dickslapped by the community for pulling a fast one on us.  They deserve each other."
79,@economist @tropoFarmer @ZeroFeeYacht @CapetainTrippy Im hearing of influencers and daos getting super rare clones ….One influencer in particular who had 3 reveals in the top 300 rarity out of 8….idk how to confirm but if some fuckshit was going on I bet someone from the community can sniff it out

88,@UnrealApe @beaniemaxi @punk4156 @nounsdao Thank you!
89,@beaniemaxi @punk4156 @nounsdao There will be daos that are made up of existing business infrastructures and deal flow that allows the dao to profit without leaning on any of its constituents. Will take time but I’m seeing this happen in other non-nft market segments using similar dao mechanics.
