80,We all counted quite a few more Super Bowl ads (or at least remembered more) aimed at building wealth through crypto rather than “traditional” assets. Bullish.

86,"Continuing the theme of buying into teams and people building the future, grabbing a @ProblySomething genesis pass was a no-brainer. I still have so much to learn in this space and what @NatFactsEth and the rest of the team are building is so exciting to join. Just the beginning! https://t.co/8h126zGiyI"
87,"@CryptoMekanik @LooksRareNFT @opensea So with those little things buyers have been molded by from only having OS up until now, it's tough to motivate the move over. BUT I do think there should be more focus on the LOOKS payout for buyers too. I think with overall less traffic on LR, sellers focus on OS for now."
88,"@CryptoMekanik @LooksRareNFT @opensea I think that's probably a fair reason. I like the interface but it's missing key OS features that buyers love: easy searching by more than one trait; hovering over the project name to see the high-level stats; and probably most importantly no notifications of offers, sales, etc."
89,"@ExoticDankNFTs @LooksRareNFT So for the ability to get WETH proportional to the amount you stake, that's a huge unique factor and a solid way at building a passive stack of WETH. Let me know if you have any other questions as you explore!"
90,"@ExoticDankNFTs @LooksRareNFT Hey there! Great question - I do ultimately think it's work staking for at least the next 90 days. There is still an APR yield of about 230% for staking, and you not only get LOOKS tokens (that auto-compound into your stake), but also a WETH reward based on site volume."
