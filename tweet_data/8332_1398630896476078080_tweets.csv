43,@TJ_NGMI @NFTxPNW We are all gang! We are all family! ❤️
44,"@TJ_NGMI @NFTxPNW Sorry for the lack of clarity. There has not yet been a decision on which organization we will donate to. It will be a humanitarian group. I have been talking with Alona, who is in Ukraine, and she is providing a few options."
45,@HakunaFrittata_ i have no idea....we are waiting for GCG to clarify
46,@Stoniphantom @gutterdan_ @gutterric @GutterMitch @gutterikarlee @GutterCatGang If we get $gang today I’ll fly out to cali and give you a hug
47,@Stoniphantom @gutterdan_ @gutterric @GutterMitch @gutterikarlee @GutterCatGang What is this TEASE!!!
48,@Vincove_eth @EugeneBWhitaker @Bagelmannnn @ABigThingBadly I hope the GCG team can provide clarity. I want this to be done right.
49,@bettertorun @TJ_NGMI It was my initial understanding that each cat got a vote. My wallet and voting allotment met that assumption. Not sure why it’s different for everyone. Maybe a snapshot was taken?
50,@TJ_NGMI Let me check on it…the GCG team set this whole process up so I’m not sure. @ClamzEth can you please help?
51,@bettertorun Thank you!
52,RT @wilson_eth: Gutter Cat Holders please vote using snapshot on this DAO proposal by Heckman. Regardless of which way you vote your say is…
53,@CedsSim LFG! Thank you!
54,@TheOneNFT @TJ_NGMI Thank you for voting! I see both sides
55,@bbrede86 Thank you!!
56,@TracyIt99 Thank you! This is what it’s all about!
57,@Vincove_eth Thank you!!
58,@JetSetTogether @ABigThingBadly What do you think would be most beneficial for Ukraine as a whole? You are experiencing everything first hand so I’m sure you’d be able to give us the best way to distribute funding!
59,@underbossnft Let’s go!!! Thank you!
60,RT @ABigThingBadly: Please go do this @GutterCatGang whether you vote yes or no (I voted yes with 62 effective votes)!  Gutter Gives!
61,@ABigThingBadly @JetSetTogether I think it would be best to have Alona pick an organization if/when the vote passes
62,@ABigThingBadly 😂 thank you Vivek! Your bags are ever growing!
63,@BoomBoomNFT Thank you gang!
64,https://t.co/lTY7MUy9cc
65,"🚨 ATTENTION ALL CAT HOLDERS🚨 
I have proposed we use 50k of our Gutter Gives DAO to donate to Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression. We need 150 votes for it to pass. If you own a cat, go to the link below and cast your vote! THIS IS WHY WE HAVE GUTTER GIVES!!!! GG"
