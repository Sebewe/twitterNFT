30,"$ETH

Looks promising but I still want to see that ~$3350 area reclaimed before getting excited.

Until this level is reclaimed and we see higher highs, we are still in a downtrend.

The higher low is cool, but keep an eye out for a potential bearish pennant starting to form. https://t.co/EKe18VcTWL"

Similar look to $btc with the recent bottom.

If local resistance can be broken at $2,800 then we may see a run to the real test at $3,250.

Regardless of whether this is a double bottom or not, reclaiming the yearly open and the most recent highs at $46k is still hugely important for me.

This break would allow a higher high to form.

It looks like $34k-$46k becomes a big ass range for the time being at least. https://t.co/ia2poqvGBg"
