13,"@jhirsh03_ True but I feel only the huge or hype projects sell on LooksRare rn. Most people are preaching to use it to pump their token stack, but too hard to use compared to OS when it’s up. Not until all quality of life changes are made will people actually go on for everyday usage"
14,"@jhirsh03_ You just said why tho, the UI is not up to par. Everyone will just stake $LOOKS and use OS to buy 95% of projects until it is updated and fixed."

23,"@dingalingts @LooksRareNFT @hildobby_ Agreed, didn’t want to come off as hating the project but the data doesn’t really support growing “authentic” volume. UX upgrades will help a lot tough rn to find what you want. Excited to see everything implemented"
24,@dingalingts @LooksRareNFT @hildobby_ Wait Ding big fan of you and LooksRare but doesn’t this data show decreasing fee’d volume and increasing non fee’d volume? Wouldn’t that be opposite of what you would want to have to prove wash trading isn’t taking over a large % of volume
25,@KlondikeNFT @AzukiZen @ZZZAGABOND Yeah knew it was gunna sell out fast but was alittle caught off guard
26,"@AzukiZen sold out in 4 minutes, can’t say I am surprised. Missed out due to failed txn, will be monitoring OS to possibly scoop. They have the war chest funded now it’s time to see @ZZZAGABOND and team go to work. From what I’ve seen so far they are legit as they come https://t.co/Vrwys42P9I"
