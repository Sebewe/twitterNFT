1,"@eezeemonee @LivSheraton More fun than the grit and grind Grizz era even though they consistently won, painful watching 7 minutes of no field goals while the defense was locking down but the offense had vanished"

10,"Do I care if I get rekt in crypto and NFTs in a downturn? No, was here in 2017. The second cycle is easier as the volatility seems normal."
11,"One of the worst things about tradfi was after about 2 years you don't learn anything you just become a hamster in a wheel. Even at the highest levels of a CPA firm there was no challenge, just monotony. Crypto/NFTs provide challenge and learning."
12,"The last 7 months in NFTs have been the most fun of my life 😂, what a time to be alive. Lived through the wild west era of a technology. As a learner type, I can't get enough. No time for sleep, too much to learn."
13,"@petergyang Buy/sell rewards were high to begin w/ to encourage trading and staking (but flaw-wash trading rewards exceeded trading fees on 0% royalty projects), those rewards are gone now so it stopped. X2Y2 has tried a new system where you earn rewards for listing items instead of trading."

25,"@JulianKlymochko @SahrTrading Saw that haha, good choice"
26,"@7thDayTrading No, wasn't in that one unfortunately haha"
27,@JulianKlymochko It’s even more interesting watching the talk on crypto/NFT Twitter trying to figure out how it should respond. Supply and demand dynamics in crypto/NFTs still not understood by most.
28,"@SahrTrading @JulianKlymochko I sold the rest of my LTC the day he announced that, I had sold quite a bit on the run up but that was it for me 😂, was one of my best crypto gains % wise of the 2017 wave. Couldn’t believe how slow it reacted at the time."
29,"$CPTN has entered the chat with $8s to $66 today as well, wild stuff in the low float de-SPACs https://t.co/c68y7Yggia"
30,@jetfanjoe305 Just today
31,"@chibiapegang Yeah, like 99% redeemed so now there is no float currently"
32,"@behindthadeuce Haha yeah it was nothing on this, VTIQ/NKLA had to work for it over weeks, this is pure broken supply/demand here"
33,@adar170 QS went to $130+ but over a few weeks not in one day haha
34,$ISPO Crazy stuff $14 to $105+ intraday⚠️. I think that dethrones even $DWAC in SPAC (or de-SPAC) shenanigans
35,"@Dominicanos1234 @circlepay It's unknown in any SPAC deal, it's when the SEC approves the merger through the filing process and with crypto/stablecoins involved that really makes it variable"
36,"@MohitGu72159291 @circlepay Yeah, doubled the valuation"
37,@peony_king They are sensitive to rising rates. They make a lot more revenue since their revenue is all interest income which is why they are projecting the huge increase in '23. Rising rates + more in circulation projected is their variables for the increased forecast. https://t.co/HOzbsTKTZC
38,"SPAC merger $CND / @circlepay (issuer of USDC stablecoin) has been updated to be at a valuation of $9B EV up from the original $4.5B.

Summary of their original vs. updated P&amp;L below. Most notable is the near 200% increase in '23 rev. forecast due to rising interest rates. https://t.co/I1uQNeaZYt"

47,"@ColinLieb Pretty sure ENS airdrop started the mutant bull run, floor was 4 on mutants when it dropped and a week later nearly 10. I sold my ENS drop (was worth a little over 4) for another mutant and saw a bunch of others do the same."
48,"@VKazes Haha, I watched the episode, pretty funny"
49,"@findmeamonster No, have you ever used SOL? Half my transactions fail, maybe more, never had an eth tx fail and done thousands"
50,"@findmeamonster Its a weird and vague response lol, I asked about the efforts of Stacks to make ethereum like products on bitcoin since they raised $150M this week to web3 bitcoin, the btc chads will be NFTing soon"
51,"@findmeamonster Looks like you are a BTC person, what are your thoughts on Stacks types products, defi/NFTs settled on BTC, is that enough security or are you a total maxi, if you excel in the BTC ecosystem I'm happy to discuss through DM"
52,"@findmeamonster I don't idolize Gary Vee, didn't even know who he was until last year, just a funny ass convo because I have the same one w/ people every day"
53,@MakingDoughnuts It doesn't even make sense but it's a cool meme to share with friends that have no idea wtf they are talking about either 😂
54,"CNBC anchor verse Gary Vee on crypto/NFTs, pretty easy to see who has done thousands of hours of research. Asking why + learning &gt; mocking + wild accusations. You don't have to agree w/ it but you should have intelligent convos, sadly, many of the detractors converse like this ⤵️ https://t.co/fkpeYnfyep"

59,"@jimmyn1c @NFTsAreNice Yeah, the items are tradeable too using their token coming later this week. Will probably see some people holding eggs long term and not changing them like serums with apes"
60,"@NFTsAreNice @jimmyn1c You have to play the game to turn it into a pet, you have to do quests and earn items and it takes like 50 items to reach the final form. The items you give it determine what type it becomes"
61,"@TheSpacSavant Sometimes the floor can be thrown off by a single item that got sold way below, average price is better"
62,"@TheSpacSavant I just look at the actual opensea exchange data to see what’s for sale, a lot of these data tools are glitchy still especially if there is a bogus listing or something. It will pick up a single listing $100k below floor which is prob what happened there"

67,"@stocksandbjj @EVNFT @anthony_einhorn @warrenpuffettt @colombiasergios and the founders, some are driven by devs, some artists, some biz types, but they all need to be doing it full time and very active in the NFT community (at all IRL events, always in spaces talking etc.). The community and founders of a project feed energy off each other"
68,"@stocksandbjj @EVNFT @anthony_einhorn @warrenpuffettt @colombiasergios It's a complex and exciting market, there is excessive noise tho. Really frothy right now as even bad projects are trading high, there has been a pull back the last few days due to crypto ripping. Study and research things a lot before jumping into some garbage hype."

73,@Ape7075 👋 held your mutant for a while
74,@geoguertin Web3 uses a crypto wallet as your sign in on every site/app instead of now you use a diff. password on every site/app. The single sign on interconnects things more as your wallet identifies you-sites can token gate by NFTs too. Metaverse/games are just apps you could sign into
75,"@geoguertin Was this referencing the metaverse and not web3? Just curious thinking about it, I certainly don’t want my kids plugged into a VR headset all day in some metaverse game haha. Like FB metaverse likely not web3 but has web3 capabilities eventually"
76,"@geoguertin Haha, not here to dunk on anyone. Just learning, investing and trading. I will defend a conviction position with passion but will always hear opposing view points. I’m sure at some point apes take a 75% draw down in short term and I’ll be getting dunked on. Risky emerging asset."
77,@geoguertin Long answer so I'll just post a picture of my thoughts I wrote up https://t.co/zMIDwEpfUy
78,@geoguertin I’m happy to hear out opposing viewpoints and love hearing them on all my investments or trades but I need to know bullet points of why you think I’ve been scammed investing in this start up to have a proper conversation
79,"@geoguertin A lot of NFTs are worthless garbage yes and many detractors will never change for sure. If you oppose something though you need to know every in and out of the ways they generate revenue and operate as a business, not just blanket “it’s a scam and you’ve been scammed” argument"
80,"@geoguertin @yugalabs @BoredApeYC I’ve been an ape for 6 months and you are just blanket saying it’s a scam. I at least have familiarity with them. Their original round sold for $200 an ape, second round at $10K an ape, that’s all they raised from NFTs. Just because the market on them went up isn’t a scam."
81,@geoguertin @yugalabs @BoredApeYC So now they’ve fooled a top VC at a $5B valuation? Right. Just because you don’t understand something doesn’t make it a scam.
