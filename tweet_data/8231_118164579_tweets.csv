50,@hudsonjameson I don't think comparing him to Hitler is a good faith attempt to resolve anything. Nor is blowing off his claim that it is his religious beliefs. Nor is having a 4 hour long Twitter space where none of the people defending him are allowed to speak.
51,@ChrisBlec @BrantlyMillegan let's vote to rehire him
52,@sohrab The fact he was willing to liquidate these names for a loss (in terms of ETH) could indicate he's lost that faith in the direction of ens. That's what's bearish.
53,@sohrab This is someone who was in ens from the beginning. I remember chatting with them before when they got amazon.eth. They spent a lot of money on really nice names. You only spend money like that if you have faith in the direction of the project.
54,@avsa The only failure so far is his removal. What a terrible precedent to set.
55,@sohrab It means people don't like the Brantly decision. Those names were all sold low.
56,@nicksdjohnson Reverse this decision
57,. @nicksdjohnson @futurealisha  we would have voted for @BrantlyMillegan. Thanks for not giving us a voice during any of this or a chance to keep him. Maybe you can distribute money from the DAO for reparations next since those whiners were calling for it.
58,"@EnsSales This name wasn't sold for 35 ETH, it was listed for 35 ETH?"
59,"@MrRoflWaffles @EnlightenedLime he doesn't need to ""back down"" - that implies he needs to change his religious opinion. but maybe he should remove his personal opinions from what is essentially a business account. he represents ENS on his twitter now. in 2016 he did not."
60,@zerozerocoins @EnlightenedLime he's reasonable.
61,"@iamDCinvestor @BrantlyMillegan Some of the people complaining today were calling for funds from the ENS DAO to be granted to people on the basis of their race and sexual orientation. At least one person who spoke for 20 minutes said, right before they left, that they aren't even involved in ENS."
62,"@iamDCinvestor You're calling for self-censorship because some people have thin skin. I'm ""LGBT"" and those people do not speak for me. I don't care if @BrantlyMillegan thinks I'm going to hell. People need to learn to roll their eyes and move on with their day when they see something offensive."
63,You are not a victim because someone else has an opinion you don't like.
