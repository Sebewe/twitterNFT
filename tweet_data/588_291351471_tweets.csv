29,@CliveApestein That’s correct
30,"If you bought ETH anytime last three months, today is a great day to do a wash sale/trade. 

Sell ETH to USD, lock in taxable loss, buy back immediately. 

For a small fee, you can use that lose come tax time to offset any gains."

47,"@tropoFarmer @Dentinmyhead @zachgoeshard @nevermindwill @tobylasso @WeatheReportNFT Launching a project soon, there are 4 founding partners + an artist. The artist is the largest individual shareholder.

This is the way."
48,Are you a top marketer feeling stuck in Web2? I may have a great opportunity for you.

55,"@davidfano @TheTeaGuns Im@not really sure, you may be right there. Was more just high level that brand often more important than short term awareness"
56,"@davidfano @TheTeaGuns Eh. It’s not just about being talked about or click throughs. They are a very well known company, so brand also matters a ton. And if much of your core demo thinks you are lame, that’s not a good thing."
57,Need to take these kids to @joesstonecrab https://t.co/nKn9ExkeQh
58,"Going to @Etheriumdenver ? Meet my man @manishsinhaha while there. Building something awesome at intersection of sports, gaming, and blockchain."
59,@itslilynicole DMs always open
60,"@ryder_ripps It was reposted in a chat, and most thought the claim was he was involved. Perhaps clarify that"
61,@gschill21 🤷🏽
62,"@ryder_ripps Not sure if it’s worse that you intentionally mislead, or don’t even realize. Either way, it’s very dangerous, please reflect. And this is not judgement on anything else but your style"
63,@ryder_ripps Not surprised
64,"@ryder_ripps Your analogy would be saying 'X is associated w/ the Miami Dolphines, then show a picture of X in a jersey on the field' w no other context. Many would think X is a player, no?"
65,"@ryder_ripps yes, i realize that...technically . That's why it's not false, just misleading. You could have been much clearer with what's going on,but clearly have an agenda."
66,"@ryder_ripps Give the facts and let people decide. His screenname matches an 80s or 90s music album, which that was named after a controversial 70s movie."
67,"@ryder_ripps Not arguing whether ok or not ok. Let people decide for themselves.  But by saying 'he is associated', then just showing a snippet, and not mentioning he's not involved in the lawsuit, is misleading. (that was my first reaction, so clearly misleading)."
68,"@ryder_ripps This is pretty irresponbile to post. Without any context, you make it seem like a founder was involved in a lawsuit. What's the actual connection? His screenname is based off of a music album, which that was based off a 70s film. That film is conroversial...right?"
69,Reminder to never list investors that aren't actual investors. We all talk.
70,@DrewAustin @tomsegal If rings talk how is Rivers above Stafford or Wilson
