31,"Finally bringing me to my last point. The community! Reb3l Bots might not be as loud as the Lazy Lions, but it's made up of some of the most welcoming people I've seen in any NFT community! Not to mention that community is growing every single day! This project, IMO, is a gem! https://t.co/60BX9BiON2"
32,"Bringing me to my second point... Just one glance at their newly released, 37-page white paper outlining the Reb3l Bot P2E game is enough to get even the most impotent of men erect. I do recommend giving it a once-over. To learn more join the Reb3l Bot discord! https://t.co/o2zMskew1k"
33,"IMO this makes it clear that the intention of the team isn't simply to get-rich-quick, but rather an attempt to create something real. Of course, I didn't come to this conclusion because of what the dev team has done in the past, but instead for what they plan to do in the future"
34,"Cancel the project after spending loads of money and heaps of time developing and refund everyone, or halve mint prices and push on. The community voted to keep the project alive, all OG buyers were airdropped an extra bot, and they sold out later that week."" -@GraveXGrace https://t.co/yvLdrYzvCv"
35,"Firstly, the team and the community have been around the block, having first launched in August 2021. ""In the first few hours of mint at 0.06, the project didn't sell out - they had a few hundred buyers. So the team paused mint and asked all OG buyers to vote. The options:"
36,"At first glance, Reb3l Bots looked like the same type of Ponzi scheme projects I've become accustomed to seeing here in the NFT space. But as I began to delve deeper into the community, really learning about the team, their history, and plans, my preconceptions began to shift."
37,"Time for my second giveaway 🧵! As I only own and plan to support NFTs in projects that I'm incredibly bullish on, @REBEL_BOTS is next up on my giveaway list.

63,"If it is a community that you're looking for in a project, have no doubt in your mind that the Lazy Lion Pride is one of the greatest. !ROAR https://t.co/MUo2udBKR6"
64,"That is not to say that LazyLions rely solely on their website features. The Lazy Lion Pride also has one of, if not the biggest, and more engaged communities in the entire NFT space. Regularly, Lazy Lion raided tweets hit nearly 500 Likes with half as many comments and retweets. https://t.co/pHT7r6GbSC"
65,"The Lazy Lions Team even goes a step beyond providing in-house analytics. From sales volume to top owners to attribute-based sales, their analytics has it all. https://t.co/1Jrj59A2om"
66,"ROARwards' Web3s capabilities confirming member Twitter PFPs, Banners, and Bio requirements with the click of a button is state of the art in the world of NFTs. It's an effort that is rarely seen in projects, and even rarer that a project implements it to near perfection. https://t.co/gW8tiwRwPz"
67,"At first glance, one might come to the conclusion that their website is like any other with nothing special about it. But this would be a mistake. 
The LazyLions integration of Web3 at one of its most foundational levels, the ROARwards program, is nothing to scoff at. https://t.co/MfW1YRG5rg"
68,"It's unlikely that you haven't already heard the ROAR of the Lazy Lion, but if you're still not sold on them I recommend you do some research.
Along with already having confirmed their @Coinbase_NFT  listing later this year, they're one of the most innovative projects out there. https://t.co/6UGCxXTr8T"
69,"In honor of @LazyLionsNFT's explosive start to the year, I've decided to host a little Lazy Lion NFT GiveAway.
