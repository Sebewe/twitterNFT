9,@basedkarbon I’ve been told the land NFTs are boooolish but they are ugly af
10,"@cur8orofearth @0xVai @_r0yart Love him too, and an absolute steal. So many paperhands on rares"
11,"@TZHammer @RonanHunt88 Similar to smart contracts, NFTs are a paradigm shift driven by technology. They’ll be used it various industries. Their impact on culture and digital life is only going to increase"
12,After reading this and exploring @Schottsy’s background I’m not touching or thinking about my @capsule_house NFTs anytime soon. Still have never listed a single capsule or zodiac https://t.co/XaJqTvfGM0
13,"@TZHammer @RonanHunt88 First sentence is not true lol. But enjoy the sideline, you severely misunderstand NFTs if you think they’re all going away"
14,@ShoTime___ @StunLikes Amen
15,"@TZHammer @RonanHunt88 Sure, and just like 2017-2018 there’s going to be NFT collections and brands that survive and thrive well beyond this cycle"
16,"@StunLikes @ShoTime___ Yes, but can chose to not give a fuck. Think there’s plenty of ppl who do that well"
17,"@TZHammer @RonanHunt88 If you owned punks in 2017 and still own them, you’re very wealthy. #2 in volume and mcap after a project which is launching merch, gaming, in person events, large budget marketing, launching a token and DAO. You misunderstand what NFTs represent this cycle. Not going anywhere"
18,"@RonanHunt88 @TZHammer NFTs are a lot more sticky. Most will die, but the ones who can maintain capture of attention are the new dogecoins but much more powerful and sticky. Projects like BAYC are becoming cemented in even mainstream culture at this point"
19,"@0xVai @_r0yart I love the both, had to take robo for a spin"
20,Gonna post a edu thread on early tubby PA once it’s hindsight
21,@jumpmanft Right 🤝
22,"And alt szn really means macro szn, because alts don’t run by themselves without ETH and BTC anymore, NFTs have fully replaced that dynamic imo https://t.co/b1CDnG2Mqt"

25,@reativeart Not if starlink decides to support it
26,"@0xinsanity @basedkarbon Yea can only do so much role playing in Nevada, plenty of equipment can’t be practically used in US based training, lots of it depreciates over a decade. Can pretty much train with anything in Afghanistan"
27,"@basedkarbon Not that I agree with it at all, but there’s a strategic reason US military chooses to be in active war 24/7 365 and live experience is a big one"

33,@BrianToups @DeezeFi @GuyNorcal @caktux Thanks to you too sir 💯
34,@RockyPocky123 @DegenSpartan Oh? https://t.co/MtnrBu3fRm
35,Remember early January when every blue chip NFT was pumping daily but scams and derivatives weren’t even minting out. When can we go back to that?

45,@crypto_bitlord7 Yes
46,@rajenruparell If you get it for under 120 you're getting a steal. Would say up to 150 for NG + Tux
47,@koeiyue Blocked this loser
48,Love NFTs becuz you get to see ppl panic by wallet. Watching ppl who ignored bids days ago undercut those bids now. Most hoomans really are overconfident under-convicted little walnuts
49,@GuidoDisalle @0xFenrir Most based take and validated endlessly
50,RT @GuidoDisalle: This space has proven time and again that long term thinking is much more rewarding both from an artists and a collectors…
51,"@0xfoobar @krybharat This + derivatives don’t care about CC0, they exist no matter what the original’s stance is. The problem is people choosing to mint trash"
52,@YKarkai Gm and welcome to CA 🤍
53,"@KeyboardMonkey3 It’s possible to be bullish on both, and within both vast majority will not succeed and it requires an eye to discern what will

54,@pravijn @dhjs_0010 🙏
55,"@dhjs_0010 @Aeralytx Congratulations to @Aeralytx and especially to @dhjs_0010, been wanting a 0010 piece for a long time and this SR genesis is a grail. There was more demand than I expected"
56,"@joshbobrowsky @worldofwomennft Actually 4 months after mint was August, BAYC had done like 800x from mint by 4 months. WoW was slow and took months to reach 5ETH. I’ve been a top WoW holder since the beginning and it’s documented on Opensea. BAYC was faster"
57,"@joshbobrowsky Agree with the post in general, but it definitely took off pretty quick. Did 10x from mint in just over 1 month. By 4 months it had done like 200x floor from mint"

60,@peritrago @Leigence Pogggg my tentacle head 💕
61,@ExtraHash @DegenSpartan Bullish https://t.co/hz3oAKRW6Q
62,@gainzxbt LOL the audacity
63,@OttoSuwenNFT Yea imo # holders matters when holders have either held for a long time or especially if entered at relative high cost basis but lower than current price. Then it because very bullish
64,"People put a lot of emphasis on unique holders for collections. This metric can be useful, but you must consider cost basis of those holders and how/when they entered (ie. pre vs. post mint)

There are collections who revealed with wider distribution than BAYC and have gone to 0"
65,"@ajiwagmi @seerlight @Kaejunni @ZeronisART @ratwell0x @tubbyCollective @GENESIS_SENSHI @GHARLIERA1 Yes, Gharliera is in a league of his own. Based bet"

67,@NaninnaTH So scrumptious!
68,@0xngmi Yes and also they’re often partnered with super strong devs like @0xKiwi_ @itsoksami and @0xngmi

70,*collector/investor perspective
71,I’m echoing @fungibleartist’s take but from a collectible perspective. Laur is herself another artist I’ve supported with @uwucrewnft aka my NFT family https://t.co/GmUFZWFHOi
72,"Added bonus that artists with strong existing reputations *IN WEB3* are unlikely to rug, are likely to understand the culture/how to create value, very unlikely to fall off 

I’m also not trying to dehumanize artists is pursuit of profit, just being real about investment thesis🤍"
73,"It also creates a liquid market w/ higher consensus vs. 1/1s for exposure to these artist’s work. Picking winners in NFTs post mint is about picking brands, and artists are a brand. Existing successful artists imo have strong asymmetric chances of success over other collections"
74,"Artists are the most natural, sustainable, logical source of new reasons for exposure for a collection they’ve launched, alongside the community of owners and any utility. If done well, the success of their 1/1s feeds value into their collectible and vice versa"
75,"The biggest issue in NFTs is how do you survive market dumps, and by “survive” I mean reclaim attention in an attention economy that has a strong recency bias and affinity to gamble mints

In order to survive, you either need utility, strong community or reasons for new exposure"
76,"I make few but highly concentrated bets in NFTs. So far in 2022 I’ve built up 3 positions:

@seerlight/@Kaejunni 
@ZeronisART 
@ratwell0x &amp; @tubbyCollective artists

I focus on artists rather than collections, will explain below how I think that creates strong asymmetric bets"
77,"@0xbread @0xinc I expect post reveal dump, but not like meka or HAPE. I think IF is overhyped, but not trash. Probably will do okay"
