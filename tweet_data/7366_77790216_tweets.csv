27,This is the exact thing which makes people think NFTs are scams - if you have a large audience you hold a responsibility to be authentic and fair. Good on @instagram for acting! https://t.co/hwNO3Syxs5

33,"RT @genv3rse: gm. 

guess who's launching today?"
34,RT @genv3rse: This is why #web3 matters.
35,"web 3: (2021-) cont. New communities are being created at a rapidly accelerating rate around different interests and niches, anyone can do it. Web3 is facilitating natural human social behaviour and this is why it’s not going anywhere!"
36,"web 3: (2021-) you consume, create and own content by leveraging blockchain technology to create digital assets. Now the content creator gets paid, the artist gets paid, the developer gets paid - participation &amp; effort is rewarded."
37,"web 2: (2005 - 2020) you consumed and created content. The ownership was in the hands of large organisations like Google, Apple, Facebook &amp; Amazon but we happily participated as this was our only way into a digital community."
38,"web 1: (1990-2005) you consumed content, you were happy - this was revolutionary."
39,"The internet is evolving and this new iteration, web3, will pay all content creators and consumers. A quick recap of the journey “so far” 🧵:"

77,"Is SuperSea chrome extension (#opensea 2.0) meant to be a hidden secret? Can't go back to using the standard OpenSea now - would be a crime to not share this
https://t.co/U2mgBWMh1V"
78,#OpenSea is down again - has OpenSea got enough of a lead to remain the leading crypto marketplace or could there be another?
79,Strategic reinvestment of crypto profits into NFTs is definitely way more enjoyable than buying more crypto. What’s the ratio of crypto:NFT value in everyone’s portfolios?
80,"@shangenflow Another point against IPFS is the dependency on HTTP gateways (CloudFlare, or your own) as well the inconsistent image load speed aspect. I believe we will still naturally see off-chain caching of images (on chain or off chain images) for a while simply  for user experience."
81,@shangenflow 100% facts - however IPFS provides a sufficient level of permanency with its inherent p2p nature and the majority of NFT consumers right now wouldn’t know the difference! I’m still a big supporter of complete on-chain tokens/decentralised applications  (true Web3?!)!
