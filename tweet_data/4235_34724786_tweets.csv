And comment below with your Qs!"
34,"I’m excited by the possibilities but also aware that reality has a surprising amount of detail.

How you distribute tokens, what incentives you put in place to reward participants vs. speculators, how you protect the value of the token. These are all questions we cant skip over."
35,"Others conspire to make it smaller:

-A world where everything is tokenized is the attention economy on steroids. Tokens become more expensive than CAC.
-Data (not always) will be portable, people can just fork and leave.
-Getting the incentive design right is hard AF"
36,"The answer, like most things in life: it’s complicated. 

Some forces conspire to make it larger:

-Better incentives, if properly structured.
-Value can be driven by much more than just expectation of future profit. 
-Tokens are liquid on day one, which commands a premium."
37,"This thread is getting long and I can hear my baby screaming in the background. But before we wrap, let’s go back to the question we started with - will the resulting pie for community-owned companies be larger?"
38,"Token-based economies can defy the laws of DCF models by accounting for intangibles such as learning, community, beliefs, and other non-monetary forms of value. 

The nature of token ownership as access can mean that we no longer need to extract profits to create value."
39,"But tokens offer one important benefit that equity doesn’t offer: utility. 

this is where our existing mental models fall short. 

today, we equate profit with value."
40,"It’s not impossible to distribute ownership in web2 (albeit w geo and legacy constraints)

for example: when https://t.co/UlQn1rStGE launched they gave 100k shares to whoever could get the most people to sign up for the waitlist. the contest winner netted ~$20M from the sale"
41,"I can use my FWB tokens to access a Discord. If I arrived at an Apple store seeking to buy an iPhone with my shares, I’d obviously be turned down."
42,"In short, if structured the right way, tokens can behave much like equity. 

BUT… and this is a big BUT… unlike equity, tokens can have utility in the form of membership and access and therefore represent more than just a lien on future dividends."
43,"Thus far I’ve used the term tokens interchangeably with equity. But are tokens and equity the same thing? And if so, why do we need the blockchain to distribute ownership?

This short piece by @ttunguz clarified a lot of my thinking on this
https://t.co/qd4uCQQOsY"
44,"In a world where the amount of things you can speculate on is ever increasing - it’s more efficient to find the next airdrop than contribute meaningfully to a single project.

The result is a depleted treasury and lots of speculators, with no resulting impact on retention/growth."
45,How many times have you dropped your ENS for airdrops without knowing whether you even want the product? The onramp for most of these projects is literally “here's how to claim your token.” It's framed around an extrinsic motivation architecture.
46,My guess is probably not for most. The high frequency of airdrops has created a culture where many  contributors join a community with the singular goal of maximizing their chances of getting airdropped future tokens— regardless of how invested they are in the community.
47,In some cases that has worked well - like Uniswap. But does it hold for other products/communities?
48,"But here’s the catch - you didn’t spend money on marketing but you did spend tokens (from your treasury). So perhaps a more accurate way to frame it is not CAC is zero but rather Tokens are the new CAC? 

(pls poke holes on this framing)"
49,"If this holds, then tokens can accelerate acquisition, improve retention, reduce costs, improve margins, and ultimately make the pie larger."
50,"so… will the pie grow by enough to offset the ownership given up?

it’s not uncommon for startups to spend 40% of their funding on marketing. 

if users are genuine owners and love telling other people about it - perhaps you won’t need to spend money on marketing."
51,we can prob assume that *most* founders/VCs aren’t doing this for altruistic reasons. investors have fiduciary responsibilities &amp; founders aren’t just gonna give up value - they are sharing upside because they believe that a less extractive network can actually be more valuable.
52,"whereas before investors + founders had ~80% of a business, in web 3 that shrinks substantially. 

ex:
in a web 2 company that exits for $100m, founders get $30m. 

in a web 3 company worth $100m founders will own $10m."
53,Of course these aren’t universal but what’s clear is that community - which didn’t exist in web 2 cap tables - makes up  a substantial amount of tokens/equity for web 3 companies.
54,"The standards for web 3 token tables are still being iterated on, but let’s assume a typical web 3 token table (fully diluted) allocates 55% for the community, 15% for core contributors, 20% for investors, 10% for founders."
55,"Let’s assume in a typical web 2 cap table, VCs own ~50% at exit, employees around 20% and founding team 30%. Customers and other stakeholders rarely own anything."
56,"It’s one thing to say “users should have financial upside in the networks they use” it’s another to ask HOW?
