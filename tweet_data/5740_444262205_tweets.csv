1,"Are there some things you never recover from? I don't know. 

I did eventually get one speaking engagement that wasn't about diversity in cannabis, from deloitte no less, and that was another happy day. I don't think that's going to happen with web3."
2,"Or when your new boss was so excited to hire you they were willing to wait for you to have surgery, and asked you when they could tweet about it.

I don't think any amount of fame or money will ever feel as good as I did during those days."
3,"At some point I'll know whether I'll ever hear congrats or well deserved again, or only ever be saying it to others.

The day I was promoted to Vice President was one of my happiest. One of the first ppl I met in person whilst anon said well deserved, and I'll never forget it."
4,"Had my semi-monthly pandemic uncontrollable cry earlier today,cathartic as usual but somehow different.

I really get the feeling that this is.. it. (personally, irrespective of the world) Almost like the final bit of sorting is done and I'm just waiting to see where I've fallen."
