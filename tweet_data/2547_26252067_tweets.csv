10,"@NFTsAnonymous @MoneyPlaneIdol @CommanderCrypt0 @TheeHustleHouse @not_katarina @topshotswickie @NFTPrince @DeezeFi @PRINTMYMINT @NFTherder @christinebarnum @CrazyCryptoCarl I think the fact that you're seeking to create a (community driven) way to filter out the noise, and rely on a set of standards to do so, should also lead to reflecting on your views about media that have similar standards in their work. They have bias; they don't make shit up."
11,"@NFTsAnonymous @MoneyPlaneIdol @CommanderCrypt0 @TheeHustleHouse @not_katarina @topshotswickie @NFTPrince @DeezeFi @PRINTMYMINT @NFTherder @christinebarnum @CrazyCryptoCarl I think the point made is a valid one though.

37,"@intocryptoast @josephdelong I actually disagree. If you're there because you're thinking about making profit, it's either a) literally gambling or b) gonna start to feel like work because that's how human psychology works.

Just build a great game that happens to let you own your assets."

86,"THAT'S the Rule of Law. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE. THE LAWS APPLY EQUALLY TO ALL. When someone tells you to imagine the power you yield being used by your worst enemy, that's why. Because once you subvert the Rule of Law, it's just a matter of time until it's your turn."
87,"If these tests fail, then other tests will follow. And I cannot emphasize enough how bad it can get if those tests fail too.

There's a reason criminal defense attorneys are able to defend the worst of us every day. Because they know that everyone deserves a fair trial."
88,"In Western societies, it's easy to take this idea for granted, because we've lived with it for so long. But it's being tested. If, for example, a President refuses a peaceful transition of power, or a government seizes assets from protesters without arrest, it's a test."
89,"Think about your day to day life. You don't have to worry about someone taking your home from you, or draining your bank account, or arresting you for what you think, even though youre (probably) not a politically connected person.

The Rule of Law is what holds that all in place"
90,"If you can't be guaranteed that the law will protect you, then your incentives to innovate, or create wealth, are stifled or removed completely. Why build something new when someone more powerful can just take it from you?

The Rule of Law affects every single part of life."
91,"It may sound reductive, but remember that in many places, people don't enjoy this freedom. In Russia, protesting Putin CAN get you arrested. In many countries, property rights amount to ""might is right.""

Such societies always have an inherent ceiling on progress."
92,"The Rule of Law ensures, for example, that regardless of your political leanings or position, you can enforce your property rights against a politically powerful person. The President can't just take your stuff.

It also means that protesting the President won't get you arrested."
93,"Laws are meant to apply to everyone equally, and apply to both individuals and the government. This system, when functional, protects individuals from each other, and protects individuals from the government.

https://t.co/qOAs8Y4K1d"
94,"When people talk about the Rule of Law, particularly in the context of civil unrest (e.g. ""restoring the rule of law"") what they really mean is ""restoring orderly day to day function of life.""

But that's not what the Rule of Law means. What it REALLY means, is equality under law"
95,"Since NFTwitter has gotten political lately, I'm going to make my own attempt at a @punk6529 style thread.
