1,🤝🤝🤝 https://t.co/6nWVsY74dz
2,"@BootsNft Yeah, got really lucky with a few raffles recently."
3,"My current strategy: mint new projects, sell before reveal, buy old projects to hodl, repeat."
4,@dannicabrene @KurtBenkert Second.
5,This is my prediction too. https://t.co/dYwj7r9zmJ
6,@KurtBenkert @Twitter I would pay .1 Ethereum for you putting Jennings in his place.
7,Gmm: Good Mutant Monday for those who celebrate
8,@cr0ssETH @not_katarina Rugged so hard.
9,"@NFTSasha @CryptoGarga Wow, goals."
10,What’s does this mean?🚨🚨🚨 https://t.co/Ds9TNUHNE8
11,@bivnft 😝😝😝
12,"Is it so much to ask for a fun, virtual reality, play/use to earn, game and social media platform, that allows me to use my Ape as my character?"
13,Sometimes I randomly think about the fact that someone bought a Mekaverse for 500 ETH.
14,@cr0ssETH I always try to tell myself you can buy it back. Don’t have emotional attachments to the NFT image itself.
15,@dkm14 Hotty toddy!
16,@CaleCrypto We all know I won this one @greg16676935420
17,So @ajdillon7 am I DDing for you and the fiancée tomorrow around Napa? #ganggang
18,@CaleCrypto I didn’t think there could be such a big rug.
19,@theycallmeshwaz Good call.
20,@just1n_eth So many sensitive people in this space.
21,@bivnft Alesmith was my first love.
22,"@CaleCrypto Hey, even uggos need someone to love them."
23,@bivnft Cool Cats are still blue chi…p
24,"🚨🚨Such wonder, many pals🤩🤩 https://t.co/vpyVgaR4Ad"
25,@RedsoxguyEth Me!
26,@doctoryuca @JeeniusETH Well definitely listen to your old lady.
27,@doctoryuca @JeeniusETH It’s a fun adrenaline rush if you’re trying to quick flip.
28,@JeeniusETH Id guess 2-3.
29,@KurtBenkert Perfect response to calm down a troll. Love it.
30,"@GregJennings @KurtBenkert 🤡🤡🤡 Character is more important than playing time. You, Mr. Jennings, have one but not the other."
31,"@EugeneBWhitaker Ok ok, I’ll agree with Wisconsin."
32,@EugeneBWhitaker Name a better state.
33,"@KurtBenkert “I hate to do this…but he’s a selfish guy”. This actually translates to, “I’d love to throw someone else under a bus to get 1 more minute of fame.”"
34,@rebeccagund Solana is just redneck Ethereum.
35,Any suggestions on where to send crypto donations for those displaced in Ukraine?
36,"@NicoleBehnam @TheArtOfWarren Ooo, some good alpha in this future discord I bet."
37,@etherzach @coolcatsnft Great move.
38,@Old_Chokes @WonderPals I think it’s too late!
39,"If Invisible Friends are worth 10-12 ETH, I’m curious to see what @WonderPals do in a few days."
40,@ShrewdCharlie @InvsbleFriends You thinking buy or hold on the Gutter here?
41,@ShrewdCharlie @InvsbleFriends What’s your status on GCG purchases?
42,Invisible friends about to make your money turn invisible too.
43,"Feels like this space is having a new big 10k PFP drop, without utility or unique roadmap, every day lately. Blue chips declining in value and liquidity being sucked out of the market. Not really sure where we go from here."
44,"@RiceFarmerNFT @minthustle Wow, no rice milk?!"
45,@friesframe Get ready for a scary but amazing experience
46,@defidefenselaw I’m predicting it settles in less than a month and we never hear anything about it again. They don’t want this smoke going into their IPO soon.
47,@defidefenselaw Congrats ser
48,Some of you weren’t here for the bear market of Fall 2021 and it shows.
49,@NicoleBehnam Wife hiding money &gt; wife changing money?
50,What does this mean?? #ganggang https://t.co/tBmGJbjMnC
51,First of many OpenSea lawsuits. https://t.co/udZ3VDArHk
52,"RT @_PPMan_: (1/2) How many wallets should you have? 

1- Degen wallet: Low-value items, use this wallet to mint, degen, and have fun.

2-…"
53,The only NFT merch I’ll be wearing are from @BoredApeYC @GutterCatGang @coolcatsnft. It’s that simple.
54,"@mrmakerbot Yeah, worst merch I’ve seen in a bit."
55,.@dingalingts Any sense to this idea?
56,This would seem to avoid some of the “hacks” and other transfer issues. Thoughts? @opensea_support @LooksRareNFT @the_x2y2
57,"Random NFT safety idea: while listing an NFT you can opt into a 15 minute (or other amount of time) opt out clause. After a buyer buys your listing, the asset sits in escrow for 15 minutes. You get an email saying the asset is in escrow and can essentially undo the transaction."
58,"Imagine when the class action lawsuit filings get written. “Mr. Smith lost $15,000 in Dickbutts”"
59,This message makes me laugh. We’re investigating and somehow we also know it’s not our fault. https://t.co/7M0t0mRAOb
60,So who else isn’t still staking $LOOKS? I’m an idiot.
61,"Send all NFTs to your cold wallet and make sure it’s not connected to any marketplaces, until this gets figured out."
62,Some good stuff coming. https://t.co/rQ5JfFQpnm
63,WonderPals could be the next blue chip in 2-3 months.
64,@bivnft I’m honestly surprised this doesn’t exist already. Could contract with various breweries to create a monthly special release. Owners of the NFT just pay shipping.
65,@bivnft Wen Craft Beer DAO?
66,@cr0ssETH @Zeneca_33 Subtle shitpost on shitpostting.
67,@bivnft Hazy IPA
68,"@NicoleBehnam Ok ok, no more jokes about UCLA being better than USC."
69,"Current bags:
-100k in student loan debt"
70,@NicoleBehnam *college
71,@Degentraland @ColeThereum Dude is constantly flexing how much Sauvignon Blanc he drinks. Fake ID is the only explanation.
72,@luckyape_eth .@greg16676935420
73,@luckyape_eth Degen
74,"@cr0ssETH Yeah, I walked around the Centurion Lounge and stared at random people in my MAYC hoodie. Nobody said anything either 🤷‍♂️"
75,@CryptoIce11 Beauty.
76,@anish_nft @WonderPals Me too.
77,Picked up this beautiful Captain Curry @GutterCatGang. #NewNFTProfilePic NFT by GutterCatGang. https://t.co/sYyHxJJwOJ
78,@LevelBevel4D Submitted.
79,@LevelBevel4D Would you do nfttrader for 1.6?
80,@LevelBevel4D I put in an offer on your Gutter Pigeon. Let me know if you’re interested!
81,@greg16676935420 @CozomoMedici I knew Greg was a Packer fan.
82,@mrmakerbot Where’s the desk from?
83,"@defidefenselaw @niftyjawn @KenobiDesigns I’ll allow you to use me for giveaways, counselor."
84,Got a sweet @obj playoff shot. https://t.co/IUkPNYlxzV
85,"Mmm, staying away from this project. Best of luck to all involved. https://t.co/u3IFgW5pz0"
86,"@dailyanger In English, it’s a hat you wear."

88,Something about this @TastyBonesNFT spoke to me. https://t.co/BfnQOtNXBd
89,"@ajdillon7 Bro, you’ve clearly not had cream puffs from the state fair."
90,"Friendly reminder for who to mute in this space:

Beanie
Cole
Artchick
Tmas
Flur
888
Anyone with a SOL pfp"
91,"@ColeThereum @TheShamdoo @the_x2y2 The thing is, we know you’ve made millions off LooksRare and are trying to FUD. Go drink some Sauvignon Blanc."
92,@coinbase @ReeseW @Deadfellaz @NylaCollection @BossBeautiesNFT @NicoleBehnam Super impressed @NicoleBehnam.
93,"RT @FTX_Official: The next ₿ig thing is here, even if Larry can’t see it.

We’re giving away 7.54 #bitcoin right now to celebrate! 

How to…"
