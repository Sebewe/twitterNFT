16,"@blakeallan @NickJN3 Wishing you moon.
Let me complain in peace.
😄"
17,@blakeallan @NickJN3 Point taken and maybe raffles and community art projects are a good way for a WL. But why do that for so long? You must see the other POV- continuing to generate hype for months knowing that 99% of people that are vibin’ will be left out- how can that be a positive thing?
18,"@blakeallan @NickJN3 Fren. I’m happy that you got WL and it blew up. Sincerely! Art is great and you made $$$. 
But why hype for months and amass 500k followers knowing that the 5k drop will leave 99% of your “community” behind? 
Sure it worked out for the 1%- congrats.
But the rest of us blueballed."

Maybe the spaceship may have utility in a metaverse also."
