Land should be infinite

92,@GlowingPalms @mathieutebele @nftworldsNFT @Maliki888 Thank you for your answers. There is lots of potential with minecraft and the metaverse. I think I need to research more about the project and community but wish you all good luck building

However, I think it’s likely that profiting from one is against microsoft’s terms of service. How would nftworlds be able to continue if they lost all access to minecraft?"

95,"@GlowingPalms @mathieutebele @nftworldsNFT @Maliki888 Yes, the same model exists in minecraft. They have their own currency too, even though it’s not crypto (yet).
