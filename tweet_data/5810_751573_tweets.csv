15,"@packyM This is my goal since our recent call @packyM (ty). I’ve found the only way to understand it well, and how to meaningfully apply what I’ve learned to product, is one on one time with experts. Fortunate to be part of @KERNEL0x to have access to such folks."

18,@EdTechPeck @RinkelJeremy @VritiSaraf @mariagalanis @TheTechRabbi @PrincipalRahh She’s the best. I wish she and Crypto Casey would get verified Twitter accounts bc there are so many fake accounts for both of them.
19,@RinkelJeremy @VritiSaraf @mariagalanis @EdTechPeck @TheTechRabbi @PrincipalRahh Crypto Casey https://t.co/BO9FS5TeaX — it’s 13 minutes but you could trim down to just the what is Web3 part.

33,"@jdmoonchild @nerdzrope @KATHLEENQUEEN55 Rice, beans, and greens at a grocery store are the cheapest things. I can’t think of a bean burrito without meat and cheese as being privilege."

56,"@fromedome @dens Yes and digital versions of huge college text books are still $150+. Such BS. They don't have to print and ship huge, heavy books at wholesale prices and instead of passing some savings along to students they charge retail prices DTC for an item with much lower COGS. D*ck move."

67,"@moheroy @bf_crane Not necessarily lazy. Could have a different philosophy of life, like Diogenes."
68,What if jobs where like school or military in that you would automatically move up or move on to better opportunities if you performed well enough. HS kids in the burbs are happy to work at McDonald's bc they know they'll move on. Not so for kids/adults with no exit strategy 🤔
69,"If ever there was an opportunity to but crypto that will 100x or more, @solana is it rn."
70,"@nytimes First some dropped jacket requirements, then some allowed jeans. Hats, sneakers and shorts (on men) might be next. The formality is part of what makes these places appealing imo. When I see a hoodie in 21 or Bemelmens it'll be over 🤷‍♂️ Same thing happening at NY and CT CCs."
71,@ErinLuhks @nytimes It's nuts how so many articles these days have misspellings and grammatical mistakes.
