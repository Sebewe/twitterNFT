28,@JerdleBMWU @Ingarment_io @abuchmoyer Yes dude! I scored that one too! Haha. I love it ☠️🔥
29,@MrDonTrip @BoredMummyWU Dude! Welcome 💪🏼♥️
30,@YanniCrypto @thegameguy101 @veve_official I feel you. Sorry I misread that. I’m sure it’s frustrating af and I’d be emotional also. Sorry if I sounded cold wasn’t my intention. I just appreciate Veve. I feel like everyone is always bent about something. Hope she’s ok tho ♥️ it does suck.
31,@YanniCrypto @thegameguy101 @veve_official Pause…she’s a victim of her own misjudgment and carelessness. It sucks. Yes. But it’s amazing to me that you’d say she’s a victim of Veve? It legit asks a second time if you’re sure of the sale. She confirmed that she was. She’s a victim? What?
32,@GeorgeV_21 Nice. I’ve only ever hit a single rebound but it turned out to be an SR comic so that was pretty rad. Congrats!
33,@gscialpa YES. I 100% agree. A solid project just like anything else takes time to build. I couldn’t care less about floor prices. The projects putting in the work will see progress. My favorite of those is @BoredMummyWU the community there has become a core part of my life. #priceless
34,"@ECOMIFam @veve_official @ecomi_ I hit, my brothers hit, my partner hit. Don’t know what they’re doing about these bots…but it’s working! Can’t remember the last time all four of us hit the drop. @veve_official NICE WORK!!"
35,@theCryptoCoolR @ECOMIFam @veve_official @ecomi_ What a great SR to score! This one is SO COOL!! Congratulations
36,@joe45781008 @ECOMIFam @veve_official @ecomi_ Whoa. Haha. You got it and it’ll be delivered a bit later.
37,@GeorgeV_21 Me too! How’d you score 2? Rebound?

45,@AddCrypt @MrJeanMelon @veve_official Good point. 💪🏼
46,@AddCrypt @MrJeanMelon @veve_official And I honestly prefer that convo to the constant finger pointing and “influencer” drama. Who cares? Get back to the NFTs.
47,"@AddCrypt @MrJeanMelon @veve_official Prob a bit right. But also a catch 22. I LOVE talking about my fave collectibles. If I were an influencer…when I did, I’d surely be accused of something. Ppl should be able to hear opinions then make decisions. We’re not sheep. No one’s fault if we don’t think for ourselves."
48,@SamEllisNFT You should just do you man. Who cares what these clowns say? The only problem you need to get around is responding to it. Your content is great. Stay in your lane and ignore these trolls.
49,@AddCrypt @MrJeanMelon @veve_official “Impose their influence” seems that if someone is following a person they’re doing it because they want to. Not much of an imposition really.

77,@FosterHilt @nf_tendies Fortunately for us though this is a FAR greater deal that the gems I see being sold for .65 off app. I get the frustration tho. And compiled with the fees on some of the pieces…that’s close to 20% in fees to sell a piece and withdraw your profits.

90,@Shibaxx1 @DiscoverXnft Same. Haha
91,@IdisconnectfrmU @salsakesh @TheWestRoad1 @Chaosium_Inc I get your point. I’m just not sure why the aggressively closed minded attitude. No one is telling you to get an NFT. Why so mad? I have a hard time understanding.
92,@MontandonGuy @Chaosium_Inc Yes dude. Was totally thinking the same thing. My favorite comment was from a board gamer going on about NFTs not even being real. Like his hobby isn’t spending hours in a completely made up and non existent world. Which is cool…but like Jane some self awareness. Lol
93,@BarefootWBoats @Chaosium_Inc @veve_official This. 💯
94,@DarkForestPress @DJCrypto17 @kakigaijin @Chaosium_Inc It’s seven. 7 kilowatt hours to roll those dice. I looked it up and this is the internet so you know I’m not lying.
95,"@Crypt0casio @NeuroOptik @tattoosandbones That’s just the thing though. EVERY SINGLE “conversation” I’ve had with someone so opposed to NFTs has been based on assumptions, misinformation and complete falsehoods. I’m good with that. Sad to see a company make an extremely short sighted and regrettable decision based on FUD"
