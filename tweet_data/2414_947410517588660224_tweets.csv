28,"@aiden393 @xaecooks because it became more prevalent in society and obviously shed light on the issues. When only 1 person is fighting for rights nobody agrees with (because nobody else really wants to be gay), the laws and stigma obviously wouldn't change. But now that it's more common, its accepte"
29,"@aiden393 @xaecooks Nah man, I don't agree with this argument. Of course there were gay people before and they hid it because of laws/stigma. But there were WAY less (including those hiding it). Otherwise, advances would have happened sooner - the reason that we got rid of the stigma and laws is"

It happened naturally because of human nature. Males (not all obviously, but overall and thru time)naturally appeal to different things than girls"
31,@aiden393 @xaecooks What do you mean by “it’s society”? What about it can cause that all of a sudden?

37,"@aiden393 i mean, dating back to ancient times, girls r supposed to impress guys by looking good. obviously scientific reasons and how our brains/body works cause that. naturally just a feminine thing to do
