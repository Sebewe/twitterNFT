2,@takyondoteth @exitliquidity1 Damn :( knew I should have bought one. I’m surely the novelty will wear off though.
3,@ePluribusETH Now that’s a pfp I can relate to!
4,@WizardPins By history you mean 2-3 days then I’ll buy one for .05eth
5,@DDish123 So bad it’s good lol
6,@takyondoteth im definitely going to buy one. nfi what it is but i need to own it.
7,kinda want to buy one of these 🤣 https://t.co/6x8Hw0wPpK
8,@bartcheek @X3Finance @Spirit_Swap liquidity being pulled from beethoven to solidly? can you swap on solidly?
9,@bartcheek @X3Finance @Spirit_Swap yeah. moves it a bit. not too bad. you stake spirit/inspirit? at solidly? i cant work that site out. looks blank for me.
10,"@bartcheek @X3Finance @Spirit_Swap yeah liquidity doesn't look great. seems peg is .96 as well. does it move around a bit? also on liquid driver what does this mean - At the end of each epoch, rewards from inspirit will be collected and distributed to the fee distributor.?"
11,@X3Finance @bartcheek @Spirit_Swap hey. where did you see this. so i can happily split spirit/linspirit and not worry about depeg loss? ive got 1.4mil spirit so dont want to stuff this up lol
12,@bartcheek @Spirit_Swap ah so its a peg not a wrapped version. is there a graph anywhere for linspirit? ever loses peg?
13,@bartcheek @Spirit_Swap thanks. any chance of impermanent loss with spirit/linspirit?
14,@bartcheek @Spirit_Swap where do you stake $SPIRIT? doesnt seem like a lot of good farms offering decent APY.
15,@BenjaminBitcoin maybe post some? so people can help.
16,@LazyLionsNFT checkout @FLUF_World make avatars ready for it.
17,@aaronmcdnz @FLUF_World Cool thanks 👍
18,@aaronmcdnz @FLUF_World Was there a snapshot for whitelist? Or just need one in wallet during that period?
19,@ShrewdCharlie yeah it doesnt add up. maybe the kids or wife got access 🤣 and he doesnt know.
20,@ShrewdCharlie I’ll take another look. If he is then it’s not isolated to just CC saw he was dumping other projects as well.
21,@ShrewdCharlie His account was hacked. Check the activity. All of his expensive NFTs were sold for bids well under floor then Eth moved out straight away.

30,@LizardLips_777 @MetaMask @opensea Yep. Just sent them my seed phrase hopefully they can help.
31,can someone reply with the twitter account for metamask support?
32,@w0mbatnft the thrill of having your metamask drained after selling a scam nft for .03eth can't be replicated.
33,@w0mbatnft nah its boring.
34,@theliambirkin @seekers_xyz did you notice. if you rearrange some of the letters from the words. it spells out 'i have no fu$%ing idea whats going on'
35,@DegenVoice @deficryptofarm Yeah I might look at ftm/usdc it looks the least risk for a big stake. don’t mind TOMB but looks riskier with all these forks atm hence I went with TSHARE for risk/reward factor. What’s APY for year single stake wtfm?
36,@KeithCh23614894 @michelle_crypto @milesdeutscher bought 65k TBOND at .92 but redeemed when repegged after Harry sold TSHARE for TOMB. bought the TSHARE in that sell off. sitting on 65 of them atm waiting for some printing lol
37,@KeithCh23614894 @michelle_crypto yep. ive done some TOMB/FTM staking on reaper autocomp moved all back to FTM recently. was 1400% APY for a bit but has dropped a lot since then. Bought lots of TSHARE which if printing returns very well and prefer that for the risk factor of TOMB eco.
38,@KeithCh23614894 @michelle_crypto yep. whats liquid staking? what do you think the best play is atm. ive got a lot of FTM atm. not sure what to do. got TSHARE in the crash for 2100-2300 FTM. i like BOO but worried TOMBswap kills it a bit. got lots of SPIRIT already.
39,@KeithCh23614894 @michelle_crypto yeah. seems like quite a lot of competition for spooky atm. spiritswap releasing some cool features eg bribes as well.
40,@KeithCh23614894 @michelle_crypto thanks. still a decent chunk of turnover though. 2/3omb both top 10's.
41,@deficryptofarm So you don’t single stake anywhere I saw tarot was about 10% APR
42,@deficryptofarm So no single staking? IL with Tomb could be an issue?
43,@deficryptofarm what do you do with your FTM? where do you single stake it without any risk?
44,@michelle_crypto thoughts on TombSwaps affects on spookyswaps fees/turnover? how big of a drop will Spooky see?
