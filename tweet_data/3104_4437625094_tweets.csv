36,@LetsGetPhisycal @huhef22 Even worse when the client just asks for a whole new concept mid way through the project.
37,@CookerFlips It’s sad cause if the staff figured out they don’t need an owner that does nothing but make the most money then they can all leave and half of the groups on sneaker Twitter would be In shambles. I’m a firm believer in self worth and individuality.

42,I love being a graphic designer in the sneaker reseller community. It's so shitty I love it. You guys that expect cheap prices for detailed work are hilarious. Makes sense though since most of you pay staff $20 for a month's work.
43,@ericprhodes An artist has every right to be upset in that circumstance.

91,@littleboomstick Contests like that are content farming. Because you now have a ton of free ideas to inspire more work or whatever from the submissions that weren’t picked. A lot of contests do this especially with clothing companies. This is a problem.
92,@littleboomstick Cause they are exploitative. You can pick one winner and then use the runner ups as free inspo for stuff to put out later on. Dont even need to credit them since you can’t trademark contest entries.
