🔉 tap into existing communities to drive awareness &amp; perks  
💰 NFTs &amp; fractional ownership to potentially secure growth capital 
👀 run exclusive in-person events for web3 &amp; NFT communities"
2,"why can't cannabis brands grow like traditional brands? 

🚫 shipping cannabis across state lines is illegal 
💸 forces brands to establish new operations (grow/distribution/ retail) in each state 
🎤 still must drive brand awareness with new customers"
3,"how might web3 &amp; NFTs open up D2C marketing &amp; advertising?

🧱  build a community on discord that is subject to fewer restrictions 
🤝  partner with existing projects to market directly to consumers
👀  overlap in demographics make it the prime channel for marketing"
4,"why can't cannabis brands advertise like traditional companies?

🚫  social media sites prohibit illicit content like federally illegal drugs 
🔨  arbitrarily shut down cannabis brands &amp; influencers with cannabis content 
🎤  this severely limits access D2C marketing tactics"
5,"how might web3 &amp; NFTs improve access to banking &amp; capital?

🧩  fractionalization of ownership like ConstitutionDAO 
🤔  image owning a portion of a grow op or dispensary via a DAO
🏦  funds stored in a multiple signatures (multi-sig) wallet w/ no federal regulation"
6,"why do cannabis companies lack access to banking &amp; capital 

🏦  banks are subject to money laundering laws 
👀  cannabis remains a Schedule I drug &amp; illegal federally

🔬  cannabis contains more than 0.3% THC &amp; CBD contains less than or equal to 0.3% THC 
🤝  CBD is federally legal under the 2018 Farm Bill 
👀  this is why you see CBD social media ads &amp; can legally purchase online"
9,"cannabis remains a federally illegal drug which restricts access to

🏦  traditional banks &amp; capital sources 
🔈  proven direct-to-consumer (D2C) marketing &amp; advertising tactics

🤝 balancing in-game economics to keep healthy supply &amp; demand 
👀 creating new features to keep holder interest 
🏃 staying ahead of all the new projects with staking &amp; tokens"
18,"while tokens create a lot of benefits, it doesn't align with every project...

💰 tokens may create more financially motivated communities 
📈 teams spend creativity directed at project tokenomics
🎨 many projects emphasize lore / worldbuilding / art instead of financial returns"
19,"why are these reasons so important to holders? 

🦺 selling tokens allows them to de-risk their investment into the project 
💸 generates passive income as long as the project is successful 
🚀 allows them to maintain upside without having to trim (sell) original holdings"
20,"how does the token create liquidity for holders? 

💸 tokens can be exchanged for ETH (or other crypto) via a liquidity pool (LP)
🖼️ tokens can be used to mint new NFTs &amp; may be sold for ETH 
🤝 this allows holders to generate a return on investment (ROI) without selling the NFT"
21,"why are so many people asking ""wen token""? 

💰 staking &amp; tokens are a way to create liquidity for holders
📉 incentivizes holding &amp; reduces supply for sale on the market
📈 increase demand for the project if token economics (tokenomics) is successful"
22,"When (wen) people ask about tokens, it usually involves staking 

📖 staking involves depositing your NFT into a smart contract via the project website
💸 it generates daily interest in the form of tokens you can claim

💸 how a token may increase a project's value

🤔 introduced risk &amp; decision making into staking 
🧠 led people to build models to optimize gameplay &amp; earnings https://t.co/EK8tMvEH6w"
27,"how could you spend $wool in the first version of wolf game? 

🐑 mint a new sheep to increase your $wool earning 
🤝 exchange $wool on a site like uniswap for ETH (or other tokens) 
🐺 a wolf has a 10% chance to steal a newly minted sheep"
28,"let's look at how v1 of wolf game started &amp; popularized staking

🐑 sheep produce $wool tokens when you stake them 
🐺 wolves take 20% of $wool claimed 
🎲 unstaking a sheep results in a 50% chance all your accumulated $wool is stolen"
29,"here are the basic mechanics of staking an NFT...

🏦 deposit the NFT into the smart contract via the project website 
💸 earn daily interest in the form of tokens (claim when you want) 
🤔 decide how you want to spend your tokens"
30,"before buying into a project like this, think about...

📖 read &amp; understand the white paper especially the token economics (tokenomics) 
⛽ transactions (staking / claiming / swapping for ETH) all cost gas 
🕹️ how much enjoyment you'll get from the gamified experience"
31,"so why do people buy into a project that implements staking?

💰 it may generate passive income by swapping the in-game token for ETH
🎮 enjoyment of gamified experience &amp; optimizing earning potential 
🏆 social status of being a top player within the community"
32,"now let's talk about why NFT projects implement staking? 

💎 incentivize &amp; reward holders for holding 
🎲 build a play to earn (p2e) NFT game 
📉 reduce the supply available for sale on secondary markets"
33,"but why do projects say 1 $token = $1 token?

🚫 means no expectation the token will be worth anything outside the project
🦺 precaution to try to avoid being labeled a financial instrument (specifically a security)
💵 this doesn't prevent the token from having financial value"
34,"what are the common things you can do with a token?

☑️ vote on proposals &amp; influence the direction of the project 
🛍️ exchange for in-game project goods like new NFTs or merch 
💰 swap the token for another token or crypto asset (like ETH)"
35,"what is staking an NFT &amp; how does it work? 

🏦 when you deposit an NFT into a smart contract via the project website 
💸 it pays out daily interest in the form of a token that you must claim
🤝 the token allows you to do certain things within the project ecosystem"

📈 allowing me to hold long term &amp; take profits when necessary
😌 reduce the worry of the typical ups and downs of the project https://t.co/21vLzlLUcQ"
39,"I listed my meta angel at 0.75 for a few reasons...

👀 many ""rare"" angels were being sold for 1+ ETH &amp; I wanted a quick sale 
🎯 wanted to breakeven with some profit

🚀 when a project reaches new price highs 
👀 if the profits would improve your financial situation"
45,"NFTs are also some of the riskiest &amp; highly speculative assets so...

💸 taking a profit reduces your overall risk exposure 
📈 you can roll those profits into minting new projects 
🤔 you can also buy back into the project later if the price dips"
46,"but it's important to remember that NFTs can...

💸 change your financial circumstances at any point in time
❤️ communities care about you more than ownership of the NFT  
🤝 you can still believe in a project while selling the NFT"
47,"selling an NFT can be really difficult because...

🤔 you don't want to be the one who sold too soon (""paper hand"") &amp; miss out on the next big project
❤️ you genuinely love the community &amp; identify w/ the artwork 
👀 you don't want to be accused of not believing in the project"
48,"are you new to NFTs &amp; finding it difficult to sell them?

🤔 take your time to evaluate projects 
❗ look for red flags &amp; things that don't look right 
📉 understand that most projects will not succeed"
53,"so why do some people use this minting strategy? 

🦺 selling 1-2 to breakeven &amp; profit de-risks your holdings 
💵 you can roll these into minting the next project 
🎢 one to keep for the upside if it becomes the next big thing"
54,"are you planning to mint a new project? here's a strategy for minting 

🛍️ mint multiple NFTs (at least 3) if possible 
💵 1-2 to sell to reach breakeven &amp; ideally a profit 
💎 one to hold &amp; see where the project goes"

It's healthy &amp; smart to take profits quickly or preserve capital when an NFT trade (""flip"") doesn't work out 

If you enjoyed this 🧵 consider following me for more! You'll learn more about NFTs / web3 / DAOs / DeFi"
66,"I still believe in the project &amp; plan on participating but 

💰 breaking even w/ ~.26 ETH in profit reduced most risk of holding long term
📈 when I sell next it will be pure profit 
🤝 can invest in other projects without increasing capital invested"
67,"Here's a reason why it's great to have ""paper hands""

👼 a week ago I minted 3 meta angels for ~0.41 ETH total
📈 3 days later I flipped one for .75 ETH
🦺 this de-risked my holding &amp; took profits"
68,"Just because you have ""paper hands"" doesn't mean...

🤝 you can't participate in the community &amp; add value to it 
😟 you should feel guilty about selling for a profit 
📈 you think the project will fail"
69,"But having ""paper hands"" is healthy &amp; good practice 

💸 NFTs are extremely risky, so taking profits is healthy &amp; reduces risk
🦺 preserving capital prevents you from losing everything (""getting rekt"") 
🎊 NFTs can create life-changing money &amp; you should celebrate"
70,"So why do some people not like ""paper hands""?

🔒 lack faith in the project &amp; won't hold forever (""hodl"" or ""diamond hand"") 
📉 sell below floor leading to the price rapidly declining 
🤷 indifferent to the community &amp; only in it for profit"
71,"So what does it mean to have ""paper hands""? 

🏃 when you sell an NFT quickly instead of holding 
🤔 usually it's to sell for a profit (""take profits"") or to take a small loss (""preserving capital"")

78,"@buildship_dev does this mean teams/people must fully doxx in order to use buildship? 

are there ways for people/teams to remain pseudonymous but still use your service?"
79,@TsukiNFT 👀
80,"Remember doxxing is a choice &amp; a privilege for many teams. While important for many, the best teams build trust &amp; value through execution &amp; high-quality work

81,"There are also nuanced ways for teams to doxx while remaining pseudonymous

🔉 hosting voice chats in Discord or Twitter (AMAs &amp; Spaces)
🤝 trusted individuals or influencers vouching for the team 
🎙️ participating in podcasts &amp; interviews with reputable hosts"
82,"It's also important to remember a few more things about doxxing

✅ a personal choice for each team member 
✅ a privilege that many people or teams may not be able to afford 
✅ may invite harassment or invasions of privacy"
83,"It's also important to remember that a doxxed team doesn't always mean...

🎲 the team can execute on the roadmap 
👀 the identities aren't fabricated or manufactured 
🚨 the team may quit working on the project at any given time"
84,"Why do people care that a team is doxxed?

👀 belief that doxxing lowers the potential of a rug/scam 
🤔 evaluate teams previous work/NFT experience to determine risk/probability of success 
🚨 may be able to take action if scammed/rugged"
85,"Why does a project team choose to doxx themselves? 

🤝 build trust with their community &amp; potential buyers 
👀 increase perceived transparency &amp; reduce fear of a scam (""rug"")
🧠 their in real life (IRL) experience is relevant to the project"
86,"So what does it mean to be doxxed in NFTs?

🔎 making personal identifying information is public (name, social accounts, wallet addresses) 
🤔 may be done by choice (for transparency) or against a person's wishes (maliciously or to ""expose a scammer"")"

95,"But flippers are absolutely necessary to the market

👀 allow the market to determine the value of the project (price discovery)
🤝 provide liquidity in an otherwise relatively illiquid market 
🛣️ create opportunities for people who missed to enter at attractive prices"
96,"This is one of the reasons ""flippers"" are disliked by many

📉 flippers can crash the floor because they keep listing lower (undercutting) 
🚨 this can cause panic &amp; lead to more holders trying to sell 
🩹 may be damaging to the health of the community &amp; project"
97,"But what happens when ""flipping"" doesn't work the way you planned?

💳 you quickly buy on OpenSea w/ intention of flipping based on the news 
💸 news circulates &amp; is received positively so you can flip for a profit"
99,"Now let's talk through a few examples of ""flipping"" 

👀 you get a tip (""alpha"") on a popular project minting soon 
💳 you mint the project w/ intention of flipping based on the ""hype""
