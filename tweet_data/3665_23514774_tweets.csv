3,"@NFTHailer @floornfts @chrismaddern It’s worth noting that Floor had exclusive partnerships with Creepz and Shadow Quest, and a lot of us did great with Creepz so we bought a lot of SQ too (I’m one of them)."
4,"Heroku is showing there is an issue going on right now.

Sending good wishes to those working through this minor inconvenience.

With everything else happening in the world, it really puts these issues into perspective.

Sending love. https://t.co/Xf35TwqUA4"
5,"Just received my first @BoredBreakfast coffee shipment.

So excited! Of course, now I need to buy a coffee grinder lol 

But I love the branding they’ve created. And the packaging (including the shipping box and copy) was top notch.

Love love love

Happy I joined the club! https://t.co/zmDFvRx4Wy"
6,"Today was my first day back in the founder seat.

And already I'm experiencing the roller coaster of emotions.

As I've told my team, the focus for the immediate future is purely on building. The metrics will take care of themselves.

The next month is gonna be quite the grind."
7,Love this https://t.co/YG9ZRCizjg
8,"@chrismaddern Wallets are the perfect way to do this, which requires better standards in contracts"
9,@chrismaddern We need to abstract away the part that anyone needs to read / understand solidity to make sense of what they’re doing
10,"@chrismaddern Wallets should have built in capabilities to scan contracts and identify when specific contracts are doing things you don’t want.

- contract can trigger more than 1 txn (show a warning)
- contract gives control of your wallet (show a warning or don’t allow without inputting pwd)"
11,"@OfficialBBrooks @IncisiveThought Much appreciated. My goal is to help people in their NFT journey, but last night was definitely a set back for those on the edge and paying attention.

I just hope we learn from this and tighten security, but it’s a long road ahead."
12,"@IncisiveThought @OfficialBBrooks My hunch is others will feel the same.

What I’m building with @futurenftmints is intended to bring more transparency and research to the space, but when the major players can’t act properly, it hurts us all."
13,"@IncisiveThought @OfficialBBrooks The point is that this issue which impacted 32 people became the spark for mass panic last night.

It speaks to some key challenges in the NFT space, and as @OfficialBBrooks has clearly stated, he’s even more hesistant to get involved in the space."
14,"@IncisiveThought @OfficialBBrooks It appears that the victims signed something that gave the hacker permission to drain their NFTs and wallets.

But as the tweet thread I referenced above explains, there is no clear / common attack vector."
15,"@IncisiveThought @OfficialBBrooks But the issue rn is that no one really understands what happens. What @OfficialBBrooks linked was one of the victims throwing blame at OpenSea with no specific evidence, which is part of what’s led to the chaos and confusion."
16,"@IncisiveThought @OfficialBBrooks Last night, a few accounts suddenly saw their ETH drained and valuable NFTs transferred out. They began posting on Twitter, and since most were huge wallets (100+ ETH), everyone took notice and became super cautious.

Lots of confusion and it was scary…"
17,"Had to deal with the first malicious spammer today. 

I take that as a good sign lol"
18,"@EmilioSantias @chrismaddern I’ve seen the address somewhere but didn’t dig into the specific contract.

This is what the OpenSea CEO posted. https://t.co/upUW2XxwvA"
19,"This is a good read.

It also highlights the structural vulnerabilities of decentralization since coordination is a key part of centralization.

We have a LONG road ahead. https://t.co/p4mEXRJQP6"
20,"RT @dfinzer: Another update: over the last few hours we’ve talked to dozens of people, teams, and projects across the NFT space."
21,"@denbesh1 @garrettginner @CBCreepz @floornfts. You need to own an NFT to access it.

Make sure you’re looking at the official OS links, but the Gen3 is slightly less expensive on OS.

This analysis I wrote may be helpful and my pinned tweet is a video I created about the product).

https://t.co/5qHrMJofuF"
22,"@chrismaddern The issue only impacted 32 people.

The problem was the uncertainty. Even the calm communities were scrambling to revoke access and sharing info on how to do so.

Big accounts on Twitter spread a lot of bad info / speculation which was not helpful."
23,"@OfficialBBrooks I don’t think you’re wrong to want to stay away, which is sad considering how excited I am for NFTs.

This space requires more thoughtful dialogues than what we’re seeing.

The biggest accounts in the space cannot be trusted, and many contributed to the misinformation here."
24,"@OfficialBBrooks Like why was this info being sent from the CEOs personal account?

Why wasn’t more info given about the new contract? Why wasn’t it released publicly for a week or two for every security expert to review? Why not add a bug bounty to incentivize scrutiny?"
25,"@OfficialBBrooks Part of the problem was the timing of everything since OS just did a major migration for which their communication strategy was extremely bad.

This is one of their weaknesses - they do a bad job explaining things to people. They need to hire an entire comms…"
26,"@OfficialBBrooks The silly part is that everything was blown out of proportion. This impacted 32 people.

A lot of misinformation was spread, likely to hurt OpenSea, but has ended up creating FUD about NFTs in general.

OpenSea CEO explaining what they currently know.

28,"@MarkcWithington Lol…there are 260 in that browser but you can’t see them all. There’s a reason I got a computer with 32 GB of RAM.

I got a fever. And the only cure. Is more browser tabs. https://t.co/4r5UH22Cqr"

32,Wow. Had a stressful mint today but got the full allocation I wanted. Cannot wait to unwind today.
33,"@Loedx @mrjasonchoi @samclamdisco Thanks!

I run @futurenftmints and am working to builder the best-in-class analysis platform for NFTs starting with mints.

Happy to chat."

37,"It feels time for a token-gated social network where you can buy a token and then have to earn validation to be let in.

If you harass or otherwise harm a member in the community, you're out.

This twitter-enabled harassment needs to stop."
38,"Wow. Substack is incredibly expensive.

I'm thinking I could just set-up a newsletter in Mailchimp and charge people on a website for the access.

Is there a downside I'm not considering?

Substack = ~12% (includes Stripe costs)
Stripe = ~3%"
39,"I love being a part of such a thoughtful and engaged community.

It pushes me to stretch my thinking and explore ideas that may not have come to me for months.

Learn fast. Iterate. And make things better.

Find your community and help us build."
40,"Fascinating discussion about trust, reputation, and identity going on in @CPGclub right now.

Has me thinking about ways @futurenftmints should change to ensure that teams who need safety are protected while also ensuring that buyers have the trust signals needed to safely buy..."
41,"@EmDeeEm @JaiminDesai93 @tombornal @RKOTax I feel like I need to chat with you more to make sure I don’t make silly moves like inadvertently starting partnerships that will require more paperwork. 

But rn, this is how I feel lol https://t.co/QqjQvlB3OF"
42,@futurenftmints This role was filled in a week. 😉
43,"Position had been filled.

(Side note: can’t believe I opened and closed this with a hire in a week)."
44,@JaiminDesai93 @tombornal @RKOTax So no lol

47,"I’ve failed more than most people try.

And I’ll keep trying and failing until I get it right.

Iterate iterate iterate.

And then iterate some more."
48,"@KimboNFT @coinbase It eventually worked. And I wound up liking the Coinbase ad much more than the FTX and crypto [dot] com ads.

I just want the NFT product to come out."
49,Tho I’m thankful they paper handed it so I could buy it 😉 https://t.co/NNCKtbAd42
50,Coinbase ad &gt; FTX &gt; crypto [dot] com
51,"I didn’t get it…Chris and others in @CPGclub had to explain it, slowly. Then I saw the FTX ad, and it clicked.

That Coinbase ad was brilliant. No more questions.

Learning every day with this group. https://t.co/xcMVjtXjtt"
52,"@CristinaVanko Just connected with some people and LTV is apparently around $200, so I’m now convinced the ad was brilliant.

Especially after seeing the FTX one. It was hilarious, but the lower funnel Coinbase QR code will likely have higher conversion. They sold me."
53,"@CristinaVanko I guess. I wonder what their CAC breakeven is.

Super Bowl ad - $6.5M
Existing User Contest - $3M
New user discount - $15/user

Some people will talk about it, but mainly for being odd."
54,@CristinaVanko They also could have linked to their NFT product instead of the exchange 🤷‍♂️
55,"So wait...the @coinbase QR code was for their main product and not NFTs?

And it only took 20 tries for it to fail on my app, and then I had to switch to my laptop.

Remind me why a blockchain sweepstakes can't be done instantly?"

62,"Growing to 12 teammates in 2-3 weeks is considered fast, right?"
63,"Staying so busy with @futurenftmints that I only opened my @floornfts app just now (I’m doing fine).

The day I go without looking at my portfolio at all is the day Future NFT Mints is firing on all cylinders.

I cannot wait!"

67,@CristinaVanko @ellebeecher @1800flowers Ok. Picture of flowers it is. Makes budget constraints easier to manage lol
68,@CristinaVanko Great idea!
69,"@CristinaVanko @ellebeecher @1800flowers Otherwise, you’ll have to settle for a picture of flowers lol"
70,"@CristinaVanko @ellebeecher It’d be like Amazon’s wishlist. 

@1800flowers do you offer this feature?

OR @CristinaVanko, you tell me a flower shop where they have your address, and I’ll tell them your handle plus the flowers to send. You could even tell them your favs so I get you something you’d like 😉"
71,"@CristinaVanko @ellebeecher I was wondering if there was a service that you could send someone flowers without having to know their personal info.

I wanted send you some 😉"
72,"@CristinaVanko @ellebeecher This makes me feel like I should be giving flowers more often, if only to brighten someone’s day.

You deserve a better class of man."
73,"I’m building. One follower at a time.

Thanks to everyone who’s already come along for the journey.

It’s going to move a tad faster very soon 😉"
74,"There is a lot that needs to be better in crypto. We’d love for you to help make it better.

Remember, as dear Teddy once said, it is not the critic who counts.

Come build with us, and fix all these problems you see.

You could be greatly rewarded by a community who values you."
75,And we also realize that crypto is a new economic tool that can help communities prosper in ways that only siloed corporations and a few individuals could in the past.
76,Many people in crypto (myself included) acknowledge the faults of crypto. We also know that many people are working to fix them.
77,"If you spent just a few moments thinking about the things you claim are bad about crypto, you’d realize you aren’t upset about crypto, you’re upset about capitalism."
78,"You say that you don’t like crypto because it consumes too much energy?

What are your thoughts on server farms or large banks or gas-powered cars, all huge power consumers with people working to reduce their dependence on so much energy?"
79,"You say that you don’t like crypto because it enables criminal activity?

What are your thoughts on the US dollar, which is anonymous, has no paper trail and is widely known as the currency of choice for illegal activity?"
80,"You say that crypto is bad because it disproportionately benefits those who get in early?

What are your thoughts on angel investing, venture capital, and the stock market, where early investors also disproportionately benefit?"
81,"@VeriteNumeris @zipcy8888 👋 this was sent my way. 

Would love to chat with you about @futurenftmints and ways we could potentially collaborate together.

DMs open."
82,"This is literally what I've just done.

I recruited 5 people who are helping part-time to build @futurenftmints (Research, Project Management, Marketing, and Design). More on the way.

This all came together on Friday, and I already feel like we're about to move 10x faster! https://t.co/s6hmXxKWYH"
83,"@ellebeecher @CristinaVanko As soon as eye contact is held for that extra second...that's when someone should walk over and say hi. Maybe not immediately...but no time like the present.

Go big or go home. Maybe both."

85,A gwei for your thoughts?
86,"@davidrgoldberg I’d be open to joining you for a space if you’d have me. 

I run @futurenftmints, and I recently put my own 2x weekly spaces with NFT founders on pause while I transition to Future NFT Mints full time and bring on a team.

Plus, I have some other media plans in the works atm."
87,@karanbhangui @madrealities Lol. I also wanted @madrealities to read that 😉
88,"@karanbhangui @madrealities Generally agreed, but her being attractive (and shall we say stylish?) is not the leading point.

It’s her hilarious personality, deadpan delivery, and ability to make the entire crypto community swoon that would captivate viewers and build an audience."
89,@swombat It may be useful to either link to a page (perhaps with an anchor tag) that explains these details or add some language on the chart itself.
90,"A haiku on NFTs and loss 😂

How I miss the days of yore
Just 3 days ago"
91,"@swombat For this one, I’d suggest…

Top Ten NFT Collections by Avg Floor

Not sure if it’s avg floor or a ‘market cap’ that represents floor * quantity of NFT.

You don’t need 1y since it’s implied by the months at the bottom.

That’s the y axis tho? ETH? Thousand ETH? https://t.co/piQt8nrkNb"
92,"@swombat The main thing I’d recommend is to make it so that the charts can be read by themselves with no other context and the reader knows that they

1) relate to NFTs
2) represent the entire NFT market

(Or are you just pulling in selected NFT collections data?)"
93,"@swombat I definitely want to add these charts to my discord. Just joined your discord and sent a message.

I like what you’re building. There could be some good overlap / cross promotion with something I’m putting together now (it’s not public yet 😉)

Would love to chat about it."
94,"@swombat I didn’t. Heading there now!

Signed up for your newsletter. This analysis is fascinating. Great work!"
95,"Anyone who dismisses NFTs and yet doesn’t acknowledge that they’re an insanely good funding mechanism for businesses and startups has ignored one of the most valuable use cases.

You can raise funds by pre selling goods and services w/o giving up equity + buyers can get upside."
96,"This is interesting to review.

The charts aren’t entirely intuitive (prob need labels like ‘NFT market size’ or something that describes what you’re seeing), but they seem to show the general NFT market moving downward.

I wonder how much the increase in ETH is playing a role. https://t.co/fYRmIwBC1i"

98,"Something I love about Web3 is the focus on inclusion.

When a leader in the Web3 community makes bigoted comments about nearly every marginalized community and then doubles down, they should no longer be a leader in Web3.

That is not the community we’re trying to build."
