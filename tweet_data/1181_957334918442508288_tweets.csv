34,"@mattmedved Yeah that’s what the space was trying to get away from in the first place. Change of mindset is a difficult concept, and even more difficult for these brands to walk the talk in the context of web3 principles and what it is trying to accomplish"
35,@HopperNation @Lewis_Tierney @muratpak I think that could happen once m(1) is reduced in a supply. Which will happen after few initial drops in my opinion. In addition per Pak it seems that many drops may be fcfs based on tier requirements

1) keep m(1) forever  
2) use opportunistically for smaller drops, get nft and sell mass afterwards for cash flow(see below)
3) use for larger drops, aim to never sell, grow based on available cash / risk target

@ShortsHoward @LTruffington thoughts?"
41,"I expect supply of m(1) and m&lt;10 to decrease significantly after first few drops. What happens if one of the following drops in couple of years is exclusive to m(1)? Based on current burn rate, m(1) may equal &gt;$20K. @muratpak"
42,"Would the strategy for smaller guys be to use 2 wallets? One empty where you quickly obtain required mass, get NFT, burn it and then sell mass at market rate (viable for smaller mass drops to limit exposure). in the second wallet keep your main mass and grow it based on your CFs? https://t.co/LYbBSSmGxk"
43,@Lewis_Tierney @muratpak Imagine if that would be followed with a drop exclusive to just m(1)

45,@ShortsHoward curious what’s your take on a reasonable target for Ash and whether I am far off
46,"$5K / $ASH would put the ecosystem at $25-50B (current $ASH cap of $100M at ~$40 but supply will grow). 

Optimistic? Maybe. Unrealistic? No.

Using RARI/RARE cap multiplier of 10-20X their 30d vol, Opensea with $2Bvol and subpar product would be at $20-40Bcap.

55,@Gfunkera86 @taratos01 @TheShamdoo Added notice of 15mins before early access resumed? Before I was able to get to my laptop it was sold over even though I was almost able to mint in the first round (transaction was failed do your pause). Appreciate work on fixing it and refunding gas but still space to improve
56,"@adidasoriginals @gmoneyNFT If today, then it’s 10-15mins heads up for 1 hour drop during which majority of folks are already asleep / made other plans. Why not delay to tomorrow and/or extend the timeline??"
57,Lol giving 10 mins heads up while majority of folks are asleep. Not cool https://t.co/ZWzAyLCUsC
58,@adidasoriginals Please share timeline of the new private mint in advance. or if possible extend early access to 24hrs so that all timezones can easily participate. Was ready for this drop and don’t want to miss when the WL code is fixed
59,@LTruffington @opensea @rarible Probably failed adidas drop nfts caused it 🤣
60,"@adidasoriginals Potential solution: for wallets with failed mint due to your pause, decrease mint price to 0.1-0.15 to offset lost gas. And extend private early access sale as people planned for this time, resuming at a random time without clear announcement ahead of time would be shitty"
61,@metakeat @jamie247 @ekaitza_ Yep my transaction also failed mid way. I guess when they decided to pause minting. Why not to have a scheduled break to resolve the issue and extend early access sale accordingly?
62,@adidasoriginals I will be on the plane in next hour. Any ETA on when it will be resumed?
63,@adidasoriginals @gmoneyNFT @punkscomic @BoredApeYC @adidasoriginals @gmoneyNFT is it because the system thinks I already minted 2 tokens even though the transaction failed and I cannot redo it anymore?
