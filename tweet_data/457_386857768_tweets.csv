we must build proper incentive models to better reward participants of our globalized digital economy

with monetary redistribution and easy &amp; impartial access for people of all backgrounds

creating and sharing value with others is key to how we’re all gonna make it

but still there is much work and innovation to be done

this new value creation, exchange, &amp; design is exhilarating and liberating but the ethos of decentralization cannot be lost

i had faith self-sovereignty without corrupt centralized entities meant a better future which brought me into crypto in the first place in 2015

but crypto being too financially focused really limited blockchain’s mainstream appeal and adoption"

prior, no single NFT had sold for more than $100K, and the big @niftygateway auction closed at $777K

one year ago marked the beginning of the wildest adoption and legitimization of blockchain assets
