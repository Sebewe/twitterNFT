2,@tubbycatsnft damn mfers look nice here
3,"You know that feeling when something just feels right?

I just got the antithesis of that https://t.co/PFgvXMzuDA"
4,"@daningoodcar think a) those fractions are smaller still than eth gas fees and b) these coins won’t come close to flipping eth price.

So yes, still magnitudes cheaper no matter what imo, but you bring up a good point that they are lower now than they will be"
5,"In the same way the value of currencies are backed by a government’s reputation/country’s “value”, crypto is backed by … data?

Feels like an interesting step in the “value of data” narrative"
6,"Not sure if it would be good or bad for crypto if whales/institutional investors had to disclose their holdings (inspired by the “my bag” tweets)

Obviously there’s no way to enforce in crypto but an interesting thought"
7,RT @zjaknb: @Mogulnate @sartoshi_nft Here is a closeup! https://t.co/HmNUEu1wv4
8,"Anyone have a framework for thinking about the market cap of crypto as a whole? Like I obviously recognize 3.7T is mostly based on what crypto *could* be, but I also think that we are destined to see the number of users/investors increase 10x in the next few years."
9,"@birdsarentrea18 I say supply, you can't really have more consumption if there is a low supply"
10,@daningoodcar wow what a hot take!
11,@hoodiemfer bless you mfer
12,@hoodiemfer link to this dashboard?
13,"RT @punk6529: us: mfers
them: metamates"
14,@0x113d hahah welcome! it’s a great project

17,@helmutchrome isn’t this literally the business model of every video game though?
18,"@StoicShitposter @CosmoCreatures is low entry, great art, and small community"
19,@babywailmer let us know what you find
20,"@CosmoCreatures low key love the mud skin, looks real enough to touch... https://t.co/HPIX3EjiYJ"
21,@dadmfers @Don_Gwei @MFers @sartoshi_nft hahahah this is incredible

28,"@jsceness @punk6529 Another reason for decentralizing … When it comes to biggest value-add vs. biggest revenue generator, a decentralized economy wins with the former, a private company wins with the latter"
29,"@jsceness @punk6529 think bigger than “UX” mate. Safety of transportation, convenience of acquiring goods, etc. 

ML doesn’t have to be as scary and personalized as you think"
30,@jsceness @punk6529 not everything has to have identities. Anonymized data is often just as good. I’m also thinking about modeling off-chain data on chain which is totally do-able
31,"@punk6529 so let’s build it on blockchain. who’s doing it?

think a decentralized model structure with incentives to provide good data  / accuracy improvements would work really well. I can’t stop thinking about the self driving car example."
32,@jj_redick @mfer4198 @sartoshi_nft @OldManAndThree you should get #mfer though JJ
33,@birdsarentrea18 the way it most manifests itself is in the human population as a whole
34,@superww886 😊❤️❤️❤️ @daningoodcar @sea_viva @birdsarentrea18
35,"@john_c_palmer @0x113d way ahead of the curve on this one. Really like the NYT analogy below. Leads back to the question I asked @matto__matto about where he sees the visual ""presence"" of @mathcastles going in the next few months."
36,"@babywailmer think about it this way, do you really believe anything you own has already hit its ath?"
37,"One takeaway from @mathcastles space was @matto__matto mentioned how the dream of mass integration (fortnite skin in SANDBOX) is actually pretty far from being built. I agree, and imo more useful would be to direct efforts on thoughtful/specific collaborations (eg BAYC x Adidas)"
38,"@0x113d @matto__matto super hyped …

excited to see more of this on chain work exposed."
39,@birdsarentrea18 every day a cross chain day

42,@0xGreedy @sartoshi_nft only if it's your prof pic bro
43,@dadmfers @sartoshi_nft @FabrizioRomano Here we go! mfers to BAYC price soon!
44,"@matto__matto Yeah I guess what I'm thinking is that ""small indie devs"" may be more excited about NFT-based video games if there exists extensive DAO tooling allowing them the freedom to tackle sub-tasks of a larger goal with their own twist as well as incentives, royalties, etc. set up"
45,@matto__matto do you think there’s an opportunity here for NFT gaming devs to grow alongside DAO tooling where this step becomes easier?
46,"@matto__matto do you think it’s something inherent to the culture of both though? Not looking for a stereotype or anything, just wondering why the cultures have led to such a wide chasm"
47,RT @sartoshi_nft: @SeaLionDAO would be a good fit for all those @Coinbase_NFT mfers
48,@sartoshi_nft can we get mfers on there??

51,"The apple wallet playbook seems like a great one for metamask to take learnings from.

Start with payments (eth) and expand to identity (ens), tickets (nfts), reservations (nfts), etc. Easy to use QR code associated with your eth wallet and you’re in."
52,@gabbar11901 @Claudia242424 top 4 scam account atm tho 👀
53,"$LORDS and $MAGIC the future. 

see you on the other side"
54,"@sirpixon @namlaK01 @AlanaDLevin @GetProtocol awesome! definitely think this solution should be the goal, was just wondering about some technicalities"

56,@birdsarentrea18 generally the nft discovery path feels very tail-driven. Either be super involved/excited or be detached and follow whales
57,@matto__matto would be so awesome
58,@matto__matto cool yeah just checking. I thought maybe there was a way to capture a live “moment” of all of the changing panels. Not sure if that’s possible though
59,@matto__matto are these the live colors of the actual pieces as they exist today? or have you filled in the colors yourself?
60,@babywailmer start dreaming
61,"@namlaK01 @AlanaDLevin Sure, point is that the some hot restaurants can easily be a two person dinner &lt; $100

There definitely could be demand to pay the restaurant double that for a reservation, but do restaurants want to charge such a high “barrier to entry”? If not, bots could control the market?"
62,@namlaK01 @AlanaDLevin there are restaurants where the reservation price would exceed the bill at that point. The best restaurants in nyc are so desired that scalping would have to exist or the reservations would become unaffordable
63,"@AlanaDLevin How would you stop bots from just hoarding all the reservations and then reselling for much more?

Also, would the value of the NFT reservation be applied to your bill? or sunk cost?"
64,@mattmedved @0x113d ‘s @mathcastles and I couldn’t be happier. Technology is absolutely gorgeous
