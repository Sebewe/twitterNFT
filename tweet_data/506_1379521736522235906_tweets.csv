It's unfortunate it happened but if you learn nothing from it it's a waste.

In future a few red flags from what I can see:
Very new twitter; No mutual follows; Responses to their tweets are all bots"
13,@TommyAvalanche @SweetBabyNicco @PuffyPawsPack @TheShamdoo You really should be vetting your own things before purchasing

She's probably had a lot of flak to deal with"

87,"@Loopifyyy @mewn21 The new investor cries for endless utility is choking the space. Teams now need to over-promise and over-deliver.
