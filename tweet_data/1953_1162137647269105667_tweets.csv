12,"2. Howlerz

A great example of how important the minting process is in the short term, in terms of the value of your asset.

👉Was ready to catch culture but the mint was infiltrated by bots

6/10

Could easily be a 10/10 if this project was an Ethereum-based project with VALUABLE utility.

#NFTs"
56,"I thought this was a well-designed NFT with great branding around the product.

It makes me think @sweet is going to be a major player in the space, based off the brands they work with and their execution abilities.

My advice: Study more Native Web 3 execution strategies"
57,"Using Ethereum and Ethereum L2 blockchains as your main blockchain of choice automatically checks one box in most collector's minds.

Remember... results and sales are the end goal at the end of the day.

Hit as many consumer metrics as you can.💥"
58,"If you're going to create your own NFT platform...
make it interoperable with Ethereum mainnet and as many #Ethereum L2's as possible.

Ex⬇️
1. @arbitrum 
2. @optimismPBC 
3. @zksync 
4. @loopringorg 
5. @Immutable"
59,"But the truth of the matter is...
Collector's want their digital assets on #Ethereum 

👉Ethereum produces 90% of the NFT volume in the world at the moment and is labeled to be the 
""next internet."""
60,"2⃣ Blockchain Use

Now I understand that these #NFT development agencies want to develop their own tech products and create multiple financial verticals within their business.

I'm all for creating your own NFT marketplace for your IP partners. I think its ingenious for founders."
61,"NFT technology is enticing to every brand in the world, because of their potential benefits but it's important to note that we're nowhere near full adoption yet.

This technology is still hard to consume for most people around the world.

You need to create NEXT-LEVEL VALUE🚀"
62,"So what would be the best way to sell an #NFT  campaign for @Kia ?

👉RELATE THE UTILITY TO THE PRODUCT

Give token holders discounts on cars and various other Kia products.

Something TANGIBLE. Something that makes Kia consumers think...
""I NEED THIS!"""
63,"I thought @sweet and @Kia should have focused on relating their utility to their product and brand.

Why do people engage with the brand @Kia_Worldwide ?

👉 BECAUSE THEY WANT RELIABLE, QUALITY CARS

#NFTCommunity"
64,"But the truth of the matter is there's only one way to earn TRUST in this space.

👉RETURNING VALUE TO TOKEN HOLDERS

Monetary value. Social currency. Simple as that.

Charity donations don't quite cut it and are outplayed in my opinion.
(Unless you're a native Web 3 project)"
65,"I completely understand why.

They are a massive corporate brand, looking to earn the trust of native Web 3 consumers and invoke emotional appeal out of their fanbase.

Donations to charity?
With cute animals at that?

They wanted to earn TRUST🤞"
66,"1⃣ UTILITY

@Kia is an AUTOMOTIVE corporate brand. I thought the utility should have been tailormade to their products and fanbase.

So why did they choose to highlight their proceeds donation to the Petfinder's Foundation?"
67,"Now let's talk about what @sweet and @Kia could have done to improve this collection.

For me, there's two things we can point to...
Utility and use of blockchain"
68,"2⃣ Great ART

I think of any major brand that's dropped an #NFT collection, the Robodog had the best art by far.

High quality 3D model, which was used perfectly in their marketing campaign.

Native Web 3 projects don't quite produce THAT level of marketing."
69,"1⃣ FANTASTIC Campaign Marketing Content

I thought the commercial for Kia was EXTREMELY well put together. 

Using the Robodog, Kia was able to invoke emotions out of viewers and peak their interest into the product.
