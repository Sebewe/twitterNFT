31,super stressed today. i feel like the only thing that can get me outta this funk is the sweet smooth voice of @andrwwang he’s got the best voice in the NFT space today
32,"@freegold I have stopped trying to speculate on when they will ship 2.0 since there have always been delays. As for sharding, yes, that is how they will approach PoS. But as per Vitalik, they will still need to integrate rollups as tps won’t be high enough for future transactional load"
33,@ethersole @AzukiZen ayeee welcome to the garden fren 🤝 https://t.co/biURnp4GGY
34,@mathieutebele thanks my brother! 🙏🏼
35,38/38 Much Love.
36,"37/38 Feel free to reach out to discuss whenever, as talking to people whether online or irl can help us bring us closer to a more efficient world"
37,36/38 Blockchain infrastructure is something I am passionate about and always love to talk about it with lots of people.
38,"35/38 This will bring us one step closer to a more efficient data driven electronic world, and will hopefully bring to light that blockchains can scale for the rest of society."
39,34/38 I believe that the future is extremely bright and exciting with these new layer 2 developments arriving soon.
40,33/38 Nevertheless. they are already integrated into some great projects namely @Immutable
41,32/38  The main downside of using STARK proofs however is that the proof size is generally much larger and therefore much more expensive to verify.
42,31/38 But what is interesting is that it is written in their own developed language called Cairo with enables the generation of STARK proofs for computations.
43,"30/38 StarkEx – Developed by @StarkWareLtd, the main difference with their layer 2 solution is the use of STARKs (succinct transparent arguments of knowledge) for their proofs. (More math here but you can google it)"
44,"29/38 ZK Porter will use “Guardians”, which act like validators, but only for the data availability part, so to further secure the PoS system of ZKSync"
45,"28/38 ZKSync uses a very interesting PoS method that is different and significantly more secure than PoS systems on other blockchains. Eventually, ZKSync wants to have their data availability solution (ZK Porter) to complement ZKSync."
46,27/38 This could be a problem when discussing the decentralized vs centralized conversation in the long run. ZKSync is able to execute smart contracts through its ZKEVM. ZK Sync uses SNARKs (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) cryptography for their proofs.
47,"26/38 @zksync  – @the_matter_labs  is the team behind one of the biggest names in ZKRs. ZKSync’s motto is “rely on math, not on validators” Makes sense since they only have one validator processing batches of transactions and generating validity proofs."
48,"25/38 One of the main pain points with ZKRs are that it is a complex and time consuming process to generate validity proofs for each batch, but since they do not require the challenge period as in ORUs, the withdrawal times are very fast."
49,24/38 This greatly reduces the size of the batches of data and hence reduces the time and cost in gas that it takes to validate a particular block of data on Ethereum main chain.
50,23/38 ZK rollups seek to ensure that each batch is acting in good faith before it is submitted with a validity proof. These proofs are then sent to Ethereum main chain as a sort of proxy for the corresponding batches of transactions.
51,"22/38 The difference with ZK Rollups vs optimistic, is that with optimistic, it is assumed that everyone acts in good faith, and only checks later if there is an issue during the challenge phase."
52,21/38 ZK Rollups – Zero Knowledge rollups use cryptographic proofs that help validate transactions. Each batch of transactions has its own “validity proof” which is submitted to Ethereum main chain.
53,"20/38 Now that we covered optimistic rollups and the leaders in that technology, lets move on to ZK Rollups, a similar scaling solution, with a very different approach:"
54,"19/38 Arbitrum and Optimism differ in that generate their fraud proofs differently. Arbitrum executes small chunks of the transaction until it finds the problem, while Optimism executes the entire transaction at once. This can cause withdrawal times up to 2 weeks for Arbitrum."
55,"18/38 Arbitrum is already integrated into popular Dapps such as @1inch , @AaveAave , @Uniswap and @CurveFinance just to name a few. It is even integrated into the @Treasure_DAO NFT marketplace 👀 @SmolBrainsNFT"
56,"17/38 This will help onboard new Dapps quickly. Furthermore, they have made it easier still for developers with the ability for them to use the same tooling currently used on Ethereum, without the need for any special software."
57,"16/38 @arbitrum - developed by @OffchainLabs Arbitrum is one of the most EVM compatible rollups, compatible with popular programming languages such as YUL, Solidity and Vyper. This is important because it helps others develop in a language they are already used to."
58,"15/38 @optimismPBC – Optimism runs on a modified version of the ETH node and has a Solidity compiler, but it does not support any other EVM languages. They run their transactional model as described above with fraud proofs, and have about a one week challenge period."
59,"14/38 One other big advantage of optimistic rollups is that they can execute smart contracts, while ZK rollups are mostly limited to simple transactions. Let’s look at 2 of the biggest names in optimistic rollups:"
60,"13/38 Like PoS systems, in order for them to be incentivized to process only legitimate data, they are required to stake ETH, which they will in turn receive a reward for processing data correctly, or they will have their stake slashed for submitting fraudulent data."
61,"12/38 If fraud is found, the rollup executes a “fraud proof” to verify transactions by running the same computational set available on Ethereum. Like many other PoS architectures, validators (or in this case sequencers) are used to process all of this data."
62,"11/38 There is however a “challenge” period during which anyone on the network can dispute the legitimacy of the data in a particular batch. (This means that withdrawal periods are significant, and this is one pain point of optimistic rollups)"
63,"10/38 Optimistic Rollups – For our purposes, again let’s assume Ethereum is our layer 1. ORUs assume that all transactions in a submitted batch are valid with no computations done at all. This greatly improves scalability since there is less data being handled by Ethereum."
64,"9/38 There are two different types of rollups, and their distinct difference lies in the method of verification of transactions. Optimistic Rollups and zero knowledge (ZK) Rollups."
65,8/38 This helps to offload most of the computational and storage burden Ethereum currently deals with while still being able to leverage the powerful security that is inherent within the Ethereum blockchain.
66,"7/38 Rollups: A transactional rollup records batches of transactions on the layer 1 chain, and executes them on a cheap, scalable layer 2 sidechain while leveraging the layer 1 (in our case we’ll use Ethereum) to ensure correct results."
67,"6/38 Eth 2.0 It touts itself as being able to do 100,000 tps with rollups. In past interviews Vitalik has mentioned that even with the advent of Eth 2.0, scalability will still be an issue without rollups, raising the question – what is a rollup?"
68,"5/38 @VitalikButerin is a genius and one of the smartest people of our generation, and he knew this was an issue years ago. He and his team began working on Ethereum 2.0 back in 2017, however, the transition to PoS (Proof of Stake) has proven to be taking longer than expected."
69,"4/38 This is extremely inefficient and will make any idea of scalability a huge issue. If we ever believe that blockchains are the future, this must be addressed. The Ethereum team understands that and is trying to address that issue."
70,"3/38 With the huge rise in popularity in smart contracts, NFTs, and Dapps (decentralized applications), the Ethereum network has gotten highly congested and at times, it can cost around $150-$200 in gas fees just to complete a transaction."
71,"2/38 Although it is a PoW (Proof of Work) blockchain, it can still do about 4-5 times the amount of tps (transactions per second) as Bitcoin. That being said, it can only do about 15 tps. For comparison, Visa’s credit card payment system currently does 1,700 tps."
72,"1/38 To understand rollups, we must first understand what is happening with the chain we have grown to love (or hate) known as Ethereum. Ethereum has proven to be built as a premier layer 1 smart contract chain that comes with incredible security. It is not without flaws..."
73,"Layer 2 protocols specifically rollups are going to be the future of blockchain scalability. With higher throughput speeds and more efficiency, the network congestion that has now become a major issue on Ethereum, may finally see some much needed relief. A mega 🧵 on rollups 👇"
