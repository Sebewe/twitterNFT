85,I wouldn’t want my 75 year old grandfather leading this country. Or anyones 75 or anywhere near fucking 70
86,Not lead the future generation they’re too stuck on the past. Not provide answers for future problems and issues because they’re too worrried about who what said and catching up on some naps. Same psychological issues I’ve seen in my own grandfather I see in these guys and
87,They do know research. This isn’t their view. It isn’t their decision.  They’re fed what they’re fed and if the meal isn’t well rounded well that sucks because that’s what they eat. A 75 year old man is getting ready to die. Not lead a fucking country
88,If you allow the consequences of today and tomorrow blur the lines and fog your view of what the future is and what it holds. Then you are lost. These old fucksdown know shit. How is that fun. I’m tired of seeing these old shits. No energy no will to want to progress
89,Do people not see that we actually live in a real world with real consequences this is not today and tomorrow this is next 10 years 20 years 50 years.
90,Who’s going to read the books and see what actually happened in history. Who’s going to stop blaming someone and take responsibility even when they have nothing to do with the situation.
91,Is this fun? Is this entertaining? Because I thought this was politics.
92,When are we going to say that it’s enough when is this kid play dancing going to stop and some thing going to progress. We’re stuck in this four year game We’re nothing gets done and blamed gets blamed.
93,At this point it’s ridiculous to say that you choose one side or the other or one side is better than the other when neither side knows what they’re talking about. We don’t elect elect someone to represent us we elect someone that’s going to pick people to give them information.
94,We allow them to think that just because they give us comments about what the main stream media says that they are familiar with what a topic is. They don’t they don’t know anything. All they know is what they tell them and that’s not just for one side it’s for all parties.
95,Why are the people we elect as presidents people that we choose to represent us. Why are they not in class every single day reading up on the topics that are truly affecting our world. Why do we elect people that speak without being knowledgeable on the things that they talk abt
