But also people should research what they buy before apeing in on OS, and it's very visible on their website."

20,@TenorJoshPage @0xQuit @GoGalaGames It's pointless randomisation if the orb ID isn't linked to the metadata. And it wasn't because the metadata wasn't even created at that point.

66,"@Pentosh1 No. They said you were ""special"". It doesn't mean the same thing."
67,@0xQuit It's because Uniswap v3 does not work with the transfer fee. Trading via USDC bypasses the v3 pool. If you check the routing it still goes via WTF/WETH.
68,@LooksRareNFT but still can't sort by price!! Surely this has to be highest priority if you want a usable marketplace.

70,"@imstefanvasilev @patrickjamesNFT It means that the images and metadata are hosted by Opensea on their servers. It also means that on the blockchain your tokens share the contract with many other artists.
