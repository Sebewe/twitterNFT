14,"Or look at Solana TVL, which fell by 55% in three months, at first it was close to $15B, but now it is only $7B. If the bulls don't ensure that SOL TVL is above $7B, then SOL will face a huge selling crisis. Now we are looking forward to the performance of ETH."
15,"Sol, known as the ""ETH killer"", faced this huge bearish bias and strong selling pressure for the first time in the past 12 months, which clearly shows that the uncertainty of political disputes between Russia and Ukraine is having an impact on the global cryptocurrency market. https://t.co/WNDaEAmFAZ"
