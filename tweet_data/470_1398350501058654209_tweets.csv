1,"@Mezmon1 @jmt_nft I’ve seen rumble in the past of people wanting to deduct all gas including personal transactions such as transfers between wallets, etc. I would advise against doing so"
2,@RDM_41 @EpiSom3 @jmt_nft Not sure I followed 100% earlier but if we are talking gas exclusive to purchases I also am also taking this approach and don’t see it as super aggressive. Where I stop personally is at things like gas to cancel offers and for personal wallet transfers
3,@nftrancher @jmt_nft @TaxMan_Crypto @AskForTaxAdvice @CryptoTaxGirl NFA but I am adding gas to cost for my personal return if you want my take on it
4,@louachu2 @jmt_nft It’s risk averse for sure. I’m very interested in seeing how others taking an aggressive position pan out. Could be groundbreaking and extremely beneficial for everyone going forward
5,@RDM_41 @jmt_nft Aggressive for sure but if it upholds it would set a positive precedent going forward for crypto users. I wouldn’t say I’m agreeing or recommend this but I am pulling for you here
6,@jmt_nft A fairly conservative approach that I personally am taking is that gas is factored into your cost basis and can be deducted for sale txns. To me it aligns with general principals and doesn’t subject the taxpayer to much risk. There isn’t much precedence or guidance around it
7,@PUMA So happy to see my former Gutter Cat being put to use like this. Insane! Wen track suits
8,Propaganda bots are out in full force today and it’s being eaten up. Can’t say I’m surprised considering half of you of you don’t do your own research before buying $10k worth of jpegs either
9,@GutterCatGang Wonder what gives with the fish? 👀 https://t.co/7pw3yCW5hP

17,"Being a parent always puts things into a different perspective. Trying to imagine myself in the same shoes as the people of Ukraine, Syria, Yemen and so on with a small toddler of my own to look after is sickening. Praying for all, it’s a sad sad world we live in"
18,@heckman_eth This is what I get for playing with fire and putting my tax dollars back into jpegs 😭

20,@JetSetTogether Take care and stay safe 🙏
21,Twitter as a whole is absolutely ruthless even in the most heartbreaking of times. It’s sad
22,Can’t believe I was able to snag this @GutterCatGang for floor price today #GangGang https://t.co/lRIKw7Avrs
23,@ShaneCultra My goodness 👀
24,@Dub_NFT About to DM
25,@Dub_NFT I’m super excited. Still waiting on everything to arrive but I’ve been ordering bits and pieces like a mad man the last few days

28,@3lueninja @GolemZGuard Your Dragonite is a beaut! My favorite Pokémon growing up
29,"@drewcoffman The “journalist” seems like a dick. I would love for him to state this exact “cult” quote to Steph Curry, Gary V, etc. in person face to face. Doubt he has it in him. https://t.co/Jqc6OL5Bi2"

33,Puma bought my (now former) @GutterCatGang 👀
34,"@KeepinItGutta @GutterCatGang @PUMA Nice you bought this one from me, enjoy fren"
35,Sure seems pretty convenient to have a hack with this kind of visibility and size to occur the weekend leading up to an executive order centered around crypto regulation…
36,@aclyeh @0xQuit @gorkulus @sup2035 From your OS profile view of all NFTs you can click the drop down in the corner of any give one and then when you select transfer it lets you pick as many as you want. I transferred 8 in one txn
37,"@0xQuit @gorkulus @sup2035 Click the options for the desired NFT, select transfer, paste new address and send. If you’ve never used it before maybe try with a cheap one to test first"
38,@0xQuit @gorkulus @sup2035 Just transferred my higher valued NFTs from hot wallet to new wallet using OS tool without issue
39,"Etherscan and https://t.co/6Aw1sAcS4X servers are down too, WHATS HAPPENING"
40,@Tree_of_Alpha @coinbase You’re a good person for this. Definitely deserving of some good fortunes your way in the future
41,NFT Ethics is good for the space but the Steve Cohen piece feels like it was written by a disgruntled Mets fan
42,"@OldPirateP @themetroverse Taking a big gamble on the metaverse land pump, we shall see what happens. The general game theory encourages you to hold multiple blocks for staking multipliers so that’s part of my reason"
43,@CalicoJack_NFT @themetroverse Gotchu!
44,"Just bought and staked 5 @themetroverse blocks, let’s see how this goes 🙂"
45,Looking to trade for an M1 + ETH. DM if interested https://t.co/kcWLehEgfz
46,@harrislipton93 I used https://t.co/6Aw1sAcS4X for the first time this morning buddy. Seems to be the safest and most efficient way. You’ll have to pay gas but it’s low at the moment
47,"@ExileDAO I’ve been debating whether to re-enter or not, just not super liquid at the moment. I like the play and hope it pans out"
48,"Claimed my $X2Y2, swapped to ETH, and revoked all accesses. That change to the claim requirements doesn’t sit right with me. With that said, thank you for the free money 🤝"
49,@arcadedotinc 👀
50,@nekulovesweebs any interest in a swap for your listed Azuki? Shoot me a DM if so fren
51,@not_katarina You and me both. I offer my deepest condolences

68,@PixelbizEth @MutantShopkeep @LooksRareNFT The offers aren’t valid. Most likely the wallet no longer has enough WETH but their marketplace still shows it as active
69,@TyHaliburton22 We are excited to have you in Indy brother
70,@topshotfund @Twitter @TwitterSupport Makes you wonder what dirt they were getting ready to dump and more importantly on who 👀
71,@DiscoverXnft Slapping myself for going on a date with someone because of an NFT they allegedly owned in the first place
72,"@NFTbark I waited an hour and a half in the queue and then had two purchase attempts fail prior to it kicking me from the queue during yesterday’s drop, it’s ridiculous"
73,Imagine being a journalist and forgetting anything you’ve ever learned about ethics just to satisfy some suits. The same people who will probably end up sweeping you under the rug when it blows up in their face. Someone make it make sense

79,"@NFTandDFSCPA @Feld4014 @kpwaltman Agree, and the headline is misleading based on how the legal ruling is explained in the article. I would consider claiming of staked earnings as “trading”/income which means the $LOOKS rewards that automatically claim are income but unclaimed WETH rewards could be excluded"

84,@topshotfund Guilty. Wen exit liquidity
85,@theknikhill @GutterCatGang Much appreciated!! 😎
86,@Helloimmorgan I still agree he overpaid for this one especially with some more rare traits that haven’t correctly repriced yet. My point was more that personally I’m a big fan of the simple apes and don’t think they’re floor but I totally get what you were saying now and in agreement
87,Extremely bullish on today’s @GutterCatGang news. Feels like a good time to show off my gang https://t.co/9Kufp1nkFB
88,"@Helloimmorgan Disagree, that ape is clean. Maybe not 500 ETH worth but not a floor ape"
89,@NathanHeadPhoto That ape is as clean as they come. Nice and simple
90,"@LooksRareNFT since I know your team welcomes feedback, an improvement I’d love to see is the removal of weth offers that are no longer valid. Thanks for your continued diligence"
