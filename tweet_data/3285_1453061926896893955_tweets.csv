30,@stoicsavage @sobylife @TrustlessState @haaailss__ @Cooopahtroopa @udiWertheimer That’s b/c Hoffman’s point is not valid at all to begin with it - just gives context why Hoffman is so off the mark. If he had friends who were poc he would actually understand it’s not his place and the virtue signaling is cringe
31,@KuraudoTFT @AlgodTrading @sobylife @haaailss__ @TrustlessState @Cooopahtroopa No one said Coopah should deserve to have nothing. POC are upset that people like Hoffman and Algod who should have no say in this type of matter are virtue signaling and telling POC how they should feel
32,@AlgodTrading @sobylife @MattToshi @haaailss__ @TrustlessState @Cooopahtroopa I’m sure you’ve never asked a poc. Not that difficult to understand https://t.co/Hmx1VYwVih
33,"So even though black people are offended it doesn’t matter by you b/c “he did not use the n word in a bad way, he was young, and everyone was doing it like 5-10 years ago” 

Who’s everyone? You must have no friends that are poc.

And I’m the idiot? https://t.co/6AJtWU0PBM"

Maaaaaan white privilege must be nice David."
