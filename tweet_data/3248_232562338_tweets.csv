3,"@Zeneca_33 Incase EO Travel backpack. I've had mine for 10 years and travelled all over the World with it. 
There's enough space in the main compartment for 2-3 days of clothes. Super padded laptop area that holds my gaming laptop + Microsoft Surface. 
So many compartments. Love it!"

50,"@not_katarina I'm luckily not near the floods this time. My wife was in the 2011 Brisbane floods, their apartment was 2 inches from getting flooded, soooooo lucky, and we were living really close to the fires that happened in 2019, we had our go bags in the car and all that. Scary shit."
51,"@not_katarina It is getting rough. My friends in Queensland are all sending videos of their basements flooded, gardens flooded, it's fucked.
2 years ago we have fires
Then we get COVID bad after 2 years isolated
Now Floods

Australia is the test for the end of the World"
