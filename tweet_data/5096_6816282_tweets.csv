0,@UrbanHikerSF I’m the next street up from this. Here’s the view from my windows. https://t.co/pQ0FospNm2
1,@CharlesForsman I had this experience with The Outer Worlds. Thought it was the first person perspective but then I played Cyberpunk with no issue.
2,@rachelandrew He has such a serious face
3,@amateurgourmet They’ll last you forever. I’ve been using mine heavily going on 20 years.
4,"@vaughnfender Glorious now has a wireless ergo model and you can turn off the RGB. Been using it for a while now, big improvement."
5,@grimalkina My brain is so broken today I read this as “a cat” and literally thought I was seeing a Twitter space with a scientist cat
6,@phillryu I am so jealous you have Pizza Hut
7,@RobinMazumder Hope you can write a book someday!
8,@mulegirl Yeahhhhh my next one will reluctantly be induction
9,@gem_ray I watched a PM draw a box in Google slides the other day without swearing once and I’ve never been more impressed
10,@swftjack Given all the tv partnerships they’ve done I wouldn’t be surprised to see them bought by like Apple or some movie conglomerate looking to break into games.
11,@stefsull Congrats!!!
12,@jenn_woodall @OniPress Congrats! This looks so good!
13,@MatHeagerty You are such a great dad 💜
14,@DanGrover Literally have an internal note titled #3
15,@crookedninja Pizza is appropriate level of gooey
16,@karenmcgrane I was also born the first / last??? year considered millennial so anyway I’m part of the protected age class now 😭😭😭
17,@karenmcgrane Yeah unfortunately. Smoking went away in malls and hospitals in my early teens but was still a thing in bars and restaurants for another decade or more. I remember being 16 and visiting SF there were commercials with wait staff pleading to end smoking in restaurants.
18,@austinkleon This is why comics from folks who are also animators are so good!
19,@karenmcgrane I am a millennial and there was smoking in restaurants and bars until I was like 20 something and there was smoking on planes until 1988
20,@gem_ray When I was in a more traditional org I asked my teams to track all decisions in an appendix to the product brief. So long as people keep up with it this worked well for us.
21,"@RidlenRich Yes Rich, even those."
22,@fredmcintyre Fred are you having a stroke
23,@matto You know in the 13th century it was kinda new so I’ll allow it
24,When I am president tv plot exposition by dreams or talking to ghosts will be a a federal crime
25,@MrEchs By more experienced do you mean senior or just tenured with the company?
26,"PM friends, what makes for an awesome partnership with your design or other cross functional peers? I have someone new joining my team and want them to have an amazing experience."
27,@tarngerine It looks like it’s still going to be very good on PS4 with a free upgrade whenever you snag the 5!
28,@mikeindustries Also going very hard https://t.co/ezIGiWcLCw
29,@KristyT I could also not endure the discomfort of people constantly being mad at me
30,@KristyT I don’t think I could handle the volume of telephone calls required to be a scammer
31,Life with conservative parents https://t.co/LceaQtHtEH
32,I’m watching Inventing Anna and saw The Tinder Swindler and like scamming seems so much more stressful than just having a job?
33,What do you mean “a collection of arcane Riot Grrrl 7 inches isn’t a retirement fund”
34,@superbryntendo I really hate how much functionality is missing in the mobile app.
35,@gabrielvaldivia I like to call this putting all my points in arcana
36,@UrbanHikerSF Do you know what kind of tree this is? Was pleasantly surprised when I took the dog out this afternoon to see the one in front of my house has bloomed.
37,"@swftjack There’s a Bose set on Buy@ that are comfortable for long periods with glasses, and the mic has noise canceling. I also just periodically drop a link to it into a team chat."
38,"@swftjack I’ve had similar conversations. Usually I acknowledge remote work is tricky, it’s difficult for me to understand them with their present setup, and then I recommend a good headset that can be expensed."
39,@lara_hogan It tells you so much about a potential manager if they don’t care whether you join their team well rested.
40,"@AaronGustafson @Brilliantcrank While we are indeed in a very privileged position as white collar workers:
- The dollar is only worth 60% of what it was worth in 1999
- The median home price was only $123k in 1999
- Students today graduate hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt"
41,@robleathern My new career goal is to never have an entire deck dedicated to how bad I am at my job
42,I am a long time believer in web standards and love it as a better approach for pro-privacy advertising on the web. https://t.co/2kY00hnNE3
43,"@karenmcgrane This person has no business being a teacher, completely abhorrent"
44,"@crookedninja Why a grueling commute is good, actually"
45,Did an office write this https://t.co/BoDoiJqNQ2
46,@JonPorty I was hoping for some coverage on a more established company like Glorious producing clones and how that harms designers. Any chance for a part 2?
47,@KristyT Anybody tries to tell me they’re staying at 5 star hotels and work for a government 🚩 🚩 🚩
48,@DanGrover Also trading windows are a thing
49,@rlyeh My first thought when I saw this was “if this were in the bay someone would’ve pooped on it already”
50,@chelscore They are not made for people with asses and yet have somehow achieved the position of ubiquitous bistro chair
51,@KristyT In the trash with both of them
52,Repeal these chairs https://t.co/L9uHrToGzF
53,@danjhayden @emiliakathleen @kianlavi Well need to get a new sword now so I can knight thee. I promise I didn’t mean to send minions after you.
54,@karenmcgrane @jeffdachis I wish I didn’t read this
55,@danmall Happy Birthday!
56,I’m sorry but if you want me to believe your show is in the 90s all the women better have eyebrows like Rachel Weisz in The Mummy https://t.co/22CRhXkDZc
57,@swftjack Time to get a keeb with a rotary encoder
58,@danjhayden Dan are you a designer yet
59,@karenmcgrane What about web rings though
60,@karenmcgrane Thank you for embarking on this important anthropological journey
61,@GK3 If I wore a white shirt it would instantly rain spaghetti no matter where I was
62,"@cameronmoll Sorry to hear this Cameron, hope you’re all on the mend soon."
63,@rachelandrew Congrats on making it through lots of big changes. Hope this new chapter brings you energy and joy.
64,@matto How’s the new range?
65,"@rachelnabors When I was younger job hopping was a way to learn a lot of skills and try new things. As I got older I changed roles if the day to day environment felt toxic / unsustainable, if my function wasn’t valued enough, or for significant comp increase."
66,@turnislefthome I just played Unpacking and loved it. Probably won’t take you the whole weekend but it’s really charming.
67,@swftjack Gonna use that ogre emoji every day
68,@summerbrennan My favorite is detailed costumes and then inexplicably modern hair.
69,@MrAlanCooper Wow these are gorgeous
70,@AndrewCrow One of the most underrated parks in the area IMO
71,"@godmachineuk There’s a Chinese place nearby with a photo of him on the wall, close enough?"
72,@godmachineuk I’ve been window shopping places in the UK let’s swap
73,"@KristyT Honestly the biggest thing eating at my sanity during the pandemic is not having cleaners and I never talk about it because the privilege. My depression gives me a very limited amount of energy, and the cleaners can be the difference between me having a good or stressed week."
74,I found a penthouse designed entirely by cocaine https://t.co/jMYX9YmBMN https://t.co/aIGD6ggu6d
75,@rileycran I feel like @Kingcast19 could get to the bottom of this mystery
76,I have spent so much money refusing to expense things because the effort and frustration required to use this garbage isn’t worth it. https://t.co/zAlAtmfjA6
77,@jeffand_ Congrats Jeff!
78,This tweet brought to you by unmasked neighbors in my yard and driveway when I’m trying to take my dog out https://t.co/gL1wdEqwGC
79,@neenerbot I’m sure the cost of living is a nice change of pace
80,@jimray I have been window shopping Tuscan villas and big old properties in the UK and Europe. I just want to go somewhere with healthcare and never look at a computer again.
81,@wordstern A linen closet! What luxury!!!
82,"I always thought San Francisco would be my forever home, but heading into the 3rd year of pandemic all I want is personal space and privacy."
83,It’s that time of year again where I’m reading everybody’s peer reviews and crying because I’m so proud of them https://t.co/AwUOjZBXGq
84,@rileycran Yeah I feel you. I wanted to take an epic trip for my 40th but alas. Hope you at least get yourself a treat!
85,@rileycran Happy Birthday!!! How are you celebrating?
86,@mikeindustries Can’t believe Batista is out here wearing a fedora still in the year 2022
87,@mikeindustries The whole season. When he goes to that guy’s house and mumbles “he likes games. But I’m not playing” looooool who wrote this dialogue. They’re both bad I don’t know how to pick a worse one honestly.
88,@mikeindustries Was it tho
89,@sensibleworld So sorry for your loss. Your dad sounds like he lived a life of intention and purpose.
90,The new season of Dexter boldly asks the question “what if a show got two bad endings?”
91,@KristyT Honestly the ROI is mostly not worth it. I’ll do a fireside chat as a favor but otherwise I want to focus on writing which is way less stressful.
92,@farbandish Wow I really wish I could catch this but I’m doing performance reviews. Will a recording be available?
93,"@thijsniks It’s not a good solution for preventing bad uses, but I do think people read more when it’s accessible and are more likely to understand what they are agreeing to. Ideally I’d like to see a mix of both."
94,"@thijsniks I think it might be Sweden that has a law requiring all legalese to be human readable. I think it’s a better approach to prescribe the outcome you want to achieve than the solution, which the government is notoriously bad at with tech (cookie banners etc)"
95,Fun fact: Cher’s very first recording is in the Be My Baby backing vocals. Phil made her stand 5 feet behind everyone else because he said she was too loud and honking.
96,"RIP Ronnie, I’m glad you outlived that piece of shit Phil. Be My Baby wouldn’t have been the same with anyone else. https://t.co/XabHDpD57p"
97,@swftjack Nobody has been bringing their A game the last two years. Be kind to yourself!
98,Why can all the news sites remember my article limit but not my log in
99,I dunno @duolingo 2 years of pandemic has made *me* sad so maybe I don’t need an anthropomorphized brand trying to manipulate my feelings https://t.co/EtoFtcsexV
