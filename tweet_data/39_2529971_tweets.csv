30,@MacBudkowski Yes exactly
31,"The result is we were left with a handful of giant incumbents and no real possibility of new entrants challenging them. 

As Helium is showing, web3 provides a powerful new set of tools to overcome the bootstrap problem and level the playing field for startups."
32,"Incumbents like Verizon solve this problem with capital- they invest tens of billions building out the network before there is demand, and then turn to the demand side after."
33,There were many other attempts. It’s a big idea that ambitious founders consistently gravitate toward. But in the past the bootstrap phase was just too tough to overcome.
34,"Helium is a great case study because there is a 20-year history (maybe more) of entrepreneurs trying to build a “bottoms up / grassroots telecom”

A network that provides utility like any other online network (Twitter, FB, Lyft, Airbnb)

50% or more (typically) of the network owned by users who built it

Strong incentives to keep the network open and neutral."

43,@benjaminchait @PeterMcGraw It’s great. I tried a few years ago but it was worse than Google. Google has fallen so far (basically all ads for the first page) that DDG is clearly better now.
