0,@DiscoverXnft Gonna take a few years unfortunately. But definitely excited for it!
1,@lovennft Honestly been wild seeing you grow. Very impressive! Appreciate you staying grounded 🙏
2,@StikTheDip BYAC was a lucky trade for many. Whoever claims they are good traders cause they bought a BYAC probably thinks lottery winners are financial experts.
3,"@Zeneca_33 It has been used for a while though. Maybe it is more common in the NFT space now, but brands have been doing it for at least a few years now"
4,@lovennft What’s the education on?
5,@jennifer_sutto I would sell. Even if you buy back into other NFTs you would be diversifying. ~$25k is nothing to scuff at
6,@NFT_Sushi @thelittlesnft 100%
7,@NFT_Sushi @doodles This is so awesome and so damn wholesome. Way to go! Very happy for you!!
8,"@nftnoobie Sounds like you aren’t much of a noobie anymore, Noobie!"
9,@dapperjman @DiscoverXnft Maybe. There will definitely be some historical value there
10,@StikTheDip @BoredApeYC Did you win anything if you were top 50? Or mostly pride?
11,@opensea_support Sounds like you all need better Product Managers
12,"@DiscoverXnft No NFT project is blue chip yet, imo. Some have possibilities but most are less than a year old, too early to call any NFT project “blue chip”"
13,@StikTheDip We in here! https://t.co/XoXihR24vn
14,@StikTheDip What does play to progress mean? Don’t you always need to play in order to progress in any kind of game?
15,"@Helloimmorgan This mentality can be dangerous for some tho. Profits are profits, specially if they can help someone’s financial situation. Even if selling later could’ve helped them more, the decision was still the correct one"
16,@0xS10E @0x_FLEA @0xApes_NFT Appreciate the detailed response. Will read up on it
17,@AdamJHowe @0x_FLEA @0xApes_NFT Doesn’t really answer my question tho
18,@0x_FLEA @0xApes_NFT What’s so special about this Flea? Haven’t read the whitepaper but isn’t this just BYAC with a yellow background? And how is that allowed…?
19,@grabs40 @0xApes_NFT So these are just bored apes with a yellow background? What am I missing?
20,"RT @thelittlesnft: RT for your chance to win a little ❤️
#letsplay #wethelittles"
21,@cr0ssETH @ChampionsP2E Hope you remember me from the Top Shot Marketplace 2.0 days 🙏 would love a shot. Discord: yeglo#6176
22,"RT @cr0ssETH: Giving away another 10 whitelists for the true upcoming AAA play-to-earn game Champions: Ascension developed by Jam City!

RT…"
23,"@greg16676935420 @farokh They say love is like a fart. If you have to force it, it’s probably shit"
24,@0x_FLEA This does so much damage to the space. Continues to give it a bad name
25,@lovennft Hope you are able to enjoy it! Happy non-anniversary!
26,MLB NFTs - don't miss out! https://t.co/eGDI8VogTv
27,This kind of thing needs to be spread more. A lot of people complain about “influencers” but Gary Vee does pretty much the same and constantly manipulates the market. Regardless if he holds with his primary wallet or not. https://t.co/p48RzFFSQg
28,@Mike_Lia_ @Gabadadi @0xBender I think so too. They tweeted yesterday he is a minor investor so definitely SOME involvement confirmed
29,@Gabadadi @0xBender I've always had a feeling he was more connected to Wolf Game than he lead on but who knows
30,"@mattdeerr @matthewmuntner @Cubs Thank you, I try"
31,@matthewmuntner @Cubs All $50?
32,@ABigThingBadly Joke’s on you. My IQ is that of mustard
33,@OttoSuwenNFT Games take time to develop though. Good ones at least
34,@StikTheDip I think it is still too early to tell. People will claim certain projects are blue chips but a lot of these projects haven’t been around for more than 12 months. It will take time to see what defines web3’s blue chips. IMO no one really knows.
35,"@beaniemaxi It’s obviously in your best interest to push this “agenda” cause of Wolf Game, but this doesn’t make sense. If there is a secondary market that they can take a % of it will make them more money than what they do today."
36,@thegregs @garyvee Hopefully you don’t get “hacked” again…
37,"@LostinNFTspace @DiscoverXnft Yes, yes we are"
38,"@HipAssApe @MsCryptomom1 @HeidiBriones @cr0ssETH @garyvee This is my thought too. People are making asusmptions from both sides, to be fair, but sometimes he PUSHES projects quite a bit. Almost too much to be just doing it “cause I like it” but maybe I’m just too cynical"
39,@lovennft Being naked doesn’t always sell. I’ve tried…
40,@StikTheDip I agree that people are lazy. I still think influencers should also be more responsible. Both can be true
41,@StikTheDip DYOR is hard for new people in the space tho. How do you know what to look into and how to asses a project when people are still learning just the basics of NFTs? I think “influencers” should keep that in mind.
42,"@StikTheDip I haven’t seen the slandering so I can’t speak to it. Attacking anyone personally/directly insulting them is uncalled for. But you are right, there is no proof so we can’t assume that. It does feel very much like manipulation sometimes tho and it rubs ppl the wrong way."
43,@0x_fxnction @garyvee @steveaoki Cult mentalities are scary
44,@StikTheDip I agree he brings some good to the space but the obvious pumping is annoying. Manipulating the market like that shouldn’t be allowed. For all we know he tells a few buddies to get in and makes THEM money while he just “holds”.
45,I bet that gaining 50k followers in 24 hours is purely organic…sure thing
46,@Jordie_Brown_ Some “influencers” pumping it I’m guessing?
47,@Jordie_Brown_ What is this for?
48,@matthewmuntner The one time I don’t deserve it
49,This is one of the best ways to get started (or continue) your NFT journey. MLB collectibles done right! https://t.co/8JgUPDCzqG
50,@ape_g4ng “Experts” didn’t know this haha a handful just got lucky and played it right
51,@0x_fxnction I wish more people had this mentality in the space and didn’t feel peer pressured into holding.
52,Tell me you aren’t a gamer without telling me you aren’t a gamer. https://t.co/PLT6jGzCqX
53,@beaniemaxi @elie2222 Probably like 90% of sports fans
54,@CoinyeJWest @readDanwrite @decryptmedia I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the purchases in Bored Apes have been just that. Including the serums
55,@ABigThingBadly @alphabettyNFT The cliques in the NFT world will attack any project they didn’t get to be a part of. They claim that “wagmi” but they don’t tell you that “we” is just when they are included.
56,@ryandcrypto @thelittlesnft Those glasses thoooo 👀
57,@grabs40 Who or what got cancelled this time?
58,"@metapital_andre @laugncow @punk6529 Definitely need that specified knowledge too. But hard work alone isn’t enough. People often underestimate luck, specially in this space"
59,"After being in the Twitter NFT world for a few months now, my main advice for new comers would be to NOT open a twitter account. Keep up some other way."
60,@laugncow @punk6529 This is absolutely false. Some people are out there working 2 jobs a day just to maintain their families. That’s hard work without any kind of luck
61,"@punk6529 I think a lot of people downplay luck though and give themselves way more credit than they deserve. I agree tho, hard work and preparation are important, but luck is constantly downplayed. Specially in the NFT space"
62,"@boxofcorey It is mostly luck. A lot of people had “conviction” to hold multiple other things that are now worth less than what they were when they acquired them. Unless you had clear information at the time that made the rise obvious, you got lucky."
63,"@0x_FLEA It is tiring. The flexing, the shilling, and acting like they are so smart but really just got lucky. It’s honestly not a great look"
64,@0x_FLEA Twitter NFT world makes me feel worse about NFTs
65,@RalphClaytonUk @drawks Vanguard funds
66,"@NicoleBehnam Depends who they are and what it is. If they are giving terrible advice to their thousands of followers, then handling it publicly is better. If it can save just ONE person from the bad advice then it is worth it."
67,"If you RT and like this tweet I will select no one to win anything, same as every other tweet with these fake engagements. Good luck winning nothing 🙏"
68,Wild how no one ever wins these https://t.co/TBluuyy9vd
69,My prediction for 2022 is that “influencers” will continue to pump their bags and act like they are only doing it to help their followers.
70,"@0x_FLEA Including some bigger names, not just the usual NFT suspects."
71,@KrisNFT @beaniemaxi No one is assuming anything. People are just stating that talking about the lines of codes doesn’t prove anything.
72,@beaniemaxi @Petitcailloueth I can also write a bunch of If/else statements and that would be equal to a bunch of lines of code. Just because it is long it doesn’t prove “competence”.
73,Been eyeing @thelittlesnft since before mint. Wasn’t able to mint but I finally got my Little! @wilxlee #NewProfilePic https://t.co/xasYpOXEAR
74,@maxcesarnunes @EricRWeinstein Science is often questioned. By other scientists. It is literally part of their process. Science questioned by people without a science background is useless.
75,@CowgirlsNFT @axmarru Is there a time limit on when we can claim? The website says indefinitely but want to confirm.
76,@0x_FLEA One of the things I hate the most about the NFT space tbh
77,"@DiscoverXnft I would recommend quality over quantity. No need to write a bunch, just write the ones you really feel passionate about"
78,"@daniel100eth People talk about blue chips, curious what you think, but isn’t it too early to really declare a project blue chip? Some might have certain strong characteristics but it is so hard to tell where we will be in 3-5 years."
79,In the NFT/web3 world it is better to spend $3 million buying something from your own collection than spending it on marketing. Not sure if it will be legal in the future (or today) but the ROI is obviously better - seems like a lot of collections do that but not transparently.
80,@343Postums Hot take but…Battle Royale mode
81,"@fad56 @ZubyMusic Vaccines are beyond just for your own protection. The more vaccinated people, the harder it is for the virus to mutate"
82,"@NatashaLogan1 @ZubyMusic Apologies, I misunderstood your tweet and thought you meant ours was weaker because of vaccines"
83,"@NatashaLogan1 @ZubyMusic By this “logic” humans should never be exposed to germs and live in bubble wraps or else they will weaken their immune system every time they get sick, and eventually die at a young age. But alas the opposite is actually true."
84,@beaniemaxi @adamfranklin_ Self awareness is a rare trait
85,@UsmanPatel_ Feeling identified there are we?
86,@NicoleBehnam I’ve always preferred smaller gatherings with people I care about
87,@beijingdou @HiCommunities Interested to check it out!
88,@FalconeEth @0x_FLEA Also a lot of luck
89,@DataNFT_ @digitalartchick That’s cause it’s fake
90,@cr0ssETH @CapetainTrippy This is the issue tho. People need to be picky with which p2e game they pick cause they can very easily lose it all
91,@lovennft @500ETH Having a shitty life is art https://t.co/sHNSOHH50T
92,"@beaniemaxi Trailers are the easy part. Actually delivering a run game with good gaming loop mechanics is the tough part. A lot of games will suck and fail massively, but there will be a handful of fun winners."
93,"@ceotim @bizzious Just because it happened once doesn’t mean it will happen again. Technically selling 4 back then was the right decision given the information at the time. Unless you are ok with what you are holding going to 0, then considering liquidation isn’t a bad move"
94,"RT @psychedelic_nft: 100 WHITELIST SPOT GIVEAWAY.

95,@wilxlee Hoping to get my first Little soon 🙏
96,@jennifer_sutto What numbers are you seeing? 👀
97,@iamDCinvestor Specially money they made for getting absolutely lucky and not necessarily because any skills whatsoever
98,@iamDCinvestor I’m a gamer and I’m very much looking forward to it
99,@sp00kley @gleek3r @topshotfund I believe you can “rollover” anything extra to another year but that’s just what I have heard. Worth speaking to an accountant for details.
