We heard you around more discovery tools and would love to hear any/all feedback. 

Keep your eyes peeled - we're not done shipping yet! https://t.co/gJCsBsOpvC"

18,".@fifirong reminded me that I was in the first ever space for this which seems like a decade ago (in reality 6 months ago). 

It's so crazy to see where music NFTs have gone over the last 6 months and can't wait to write a recap in the next 6 months! https://t.co/GOrE8hn9BM"
19,@koblas @sriramk Good point. That is another one too: https://t.co/W9DidAHg8y
20,"@sriramk @cdixon It’s spot on. No good engineer wants to be stuck in legacy tech (ie PHP). 

I think the other large selling point is this has a chance to change wealth distribution which for some engineers is just as, if not more, important."
21,"@sriramk 🎯 - the convos I’ve had with engineers have all been the same (more or less). 

“I want to work on new and fun things”"

That said you could create a decentralized Spotify as a dapp without any ETH/gas. Everything would be view functions

You could, in theory, grab all music NFTs &amp; create a UI/run as audio player"
