5,@Nate_Rivers @AntonymNFT I'm going to copy some of these taglines onto my next cover letter. Thank you ser.
6,when so many of the devs have never gotten their hands dirty and grinded in the trenches – aka lacking experience in both running a business and not spending enough time in web3 to understand the patterns and demand of the market?
7,"It takes upwards of 6 months and approx. 10,000 hours to master a skill. Launching a new NFT project isn’t hard, but maintaining value of a project is the real challenge. How can we expect a project to succeed"
8,@crispylines this makes me happy.
9,@1phillywop @CyberKongz Welkong!
10,"@PunkieEth @capag777 You're my hero, ser!"
11,@DiscoverXnft My mom would approve Kevin if he were my boyfriend.

24,@coolcatsnft 💕
25,@zscuffed I suppose life goes on...but my heart hurts and it does make me feel uncomfortable as well
26,My heart feels heavy. What's happening in Russia perhaps  is one of the reasons why we are so magnetically attracted to the metaverse. The metaverse allows each of our subjective concepts of beauty to collectively come together and recreate a much more tranquil and serene world.
27,@Ulkamak1 sending lots of love. stay safe.
28,@paddyathia Hehe 😉
29,Some people about to get invisibly rekt.

40,"Before buying into projects with an upcoming announcement hoping that the floor will pump after release of the news...pause and think - is the announcement already priced in?  In other words, the current price may already reflect the announcement and there may be no pump. DYOR."
41,"Because everyone’s doing it…I guess here’s what’s currently in my bag: 

2x fomo buys 
1 x hodl 
1 x blue chip 
5 x rug pulls
6 x slow rug pulls 
10x “the next blue chip but probably not”

48,"Liquidity allows me to be fluid and easily transition between these two platforms. Again, this is my form of risk management. 

What is the percentage of ETH to NFT ratio in your wallet? I’m curious – let me know! 
#NFTs #web3"
49,"3. When Crypto market goes up, NFT market goes down 📈
This ties in with point 2 above. When the crypto/altcoin market is down, I would allocate some of my liquid ETHs to buy into these dips. When the NFT market goes down, I take profits from my altcoin gains and put it into NFT"
50,"Obviously, how much liquidity you want to have is dependent on your risk tolerance, but holding ETH reduces anxiety and prevents panic selling."
51,"For example, you invested 100% of your ETH into NFTs and the market declines by 20%. Your entire unrealized loss will be at 20%. If you invested 80% into NFTs and 20% held in ETH, a market decline of 20% will result in the same unrealized loss of 16%."
52,"2.Reducing volatility in your NFT portfolio 💹
Holding ETH may reduce returns when the NFT market is pumping, but in general, it can act as an anchor within your portfolio to mitigate losses as your entire portfolio declines (which it will at some point)."
53,"If you are in a liquidity crunch, you’ll have to try and sell one of your NFTs asap to get liquidity…and we know that sometimes, certain JPEGs just don’t sell. You snooze, you lose."
54,"1.Liquidity provides opportunity. 🤑

A key advantage of holding ETH is that it allows for opportunistic purchases when floor prices drop on a project that I’ve been eyeing for a while or if I want to ride a wave on a project that’s pumping in volume."
55,"Liquidity is KING👑 My own rule of thumb is to hold at 20% ETH at all times. Being liquid provides me with these 3 simple benefits: opportunistic purchases, reduction in volatility, and ability to transition between altcoins and NFTS during bear/bull markets. Short thread 🧵👇"
56,@ArticEmpress @cr0ssETH This is quite smart actually. Out of sight out of mind.

70,@RegularRuben The newbies have to pay their dues to the nft gods. You don’t learn unless you experience it 🤷🏻‍♀️
71,@anroyce Same same. Learnt over time what to hold and what to paper (meaning I paper most projects...)
72,"There is nothing wrong with being a paper hand. In fact, the most successful diamond hands were at some point paper hands. It's deciding when you paper and what you paper that will determine whether you become a diamond hand or a bag holder."

89,"When you feel anxious all the time about the NFT you purchased, and you keep checking the floor price day in and day out, you either:
1. Over-invested (spent a larger chunk of your bag than you should have); or 
2. Picked the wrong project.
