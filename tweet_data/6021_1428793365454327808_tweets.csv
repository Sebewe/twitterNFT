I'm sorry you chose to not be professional and instead attacked the team and needed to be kicked from the server for that. We enjoy having you around, but you can't call people disrepectful names"

41,@TacoTribeNFTs @EESocietyNFT I said THEIR response was not meant to be kind. It ignored the question I asked. It was a rude response. Geez you are just looking to validate your anger hey?

45,@TacoTribeNFTs @EESocietyNFT No one  belittled them. They were offered advice yesterday. They came back and @ everyone today against server rules. Were told to not do that and responded rudely. They were given a 10 minute time out. And then you cam at us using swears 🤷‍♀️
46,@TacoTribeNFTs @EESocietyNFT We have a rule in our sever to not @ everyone. We are allowed to set rules in our severs to keep our discord safe. They were timed out not for using it but for telling me to calm down when told not to.
