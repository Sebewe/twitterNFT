3,@acheon_nft @MetaMaskSupport @rainbowdotme Completely madness 🤣
4,wow I tagged MetaMask support and got millions of notifications from scammers reacting to this tweet https://t.co/zxpp7YcC9q https://t.co/aMqY5H6nQL
5,"gm.. I don't understand MetaMask. Whenever I want to mint, all transactions are failing with horrible UI. I leave the gas as it is recommended (or suggested) but does not work. What's wrong? @MetaMaskSupport 

Miss @rainbowdotme for minting."
6,@zle_zlo @reverse_visuals Glad you are safe! Take care 💙💛
7,"@JamesCraigLND I also understand your point but to be fair Ukrainians are paying much harder price than any ordinary person in Russia hit by sanctions. Ukrainians just wanted to live peacefully and instead are attacked by Russians (people in army, people who supported Putin etc). It's a war."
8,"@JamesCraigLND Well, the people are partially responsible (having voting rights) so they should give pressure to the government maybe? The same for companies, institutions and elites near Putin's circle."

10,I wonder how much money were raised via BTC vs ETH. Does anyone have any data or should I go and analyse it? https://t.co/xG1pDUak9a

12,"@punk6529 We automate most tasks in our lives already (habits, knowledge) hence time flies. Curiosity and surprises are almost non-existential at certain point of life."
13,"ConstitutionDAO raised $40mio in just 6 days~ whereas UkraineDAO raised so far 'just' $3.5mio. There is still space to push for more!

@ConstitutionDAO, @Ukraine_DAO 💙💛🇺🇦 https://t.co/kGZpEE81rh"

21,@RedDevilNFT @Mfer_Chicks https://t.co/vqFExFdVMb
22,And it's not the fault of Russians.. it's the fault of elites governing the country. What worries me in difficult times like this is that it's the ordinary people largely affected by decisions of few.
23,"I visited Ukraine 8 months ago and I absolutely loved the place and the people. It is terrifying what's going on. 

Sending love to everyone affected by this. And remember that it's the people who make a country, not vice versa. 🙁"
