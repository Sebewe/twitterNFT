8,@CuttyQ10 @GitKnocked @Muddawg @CryptoMories It is a trademark and it was not filed a few days ago. Trademarks take months to complete the office has to approve it. At least 6-8 months. This trademark has history dating back to 2015.

12,"Art is a luxury. Digital or physical. The last 24hrs put that into perspective. I’m not trying to FUD, I just want to convey that #nfts are fun but at some point we have to look out for other priorities and that is ok."
13,@r_ross_campbell @0x_intern I saw someone with crypto==fascism on their profile today. 🤦‍♂️ . Really. So many pple working against that goal. Not to mention protocols are neutral. Maybe I will have $ford==fascism since he actually bankrolled hitler back in the day. Idiots. Let’s be adults

15,@davetroy you are clueless about crypto. You still need to interface with a bank to offload your money from crypto to fiat. So the problem is traditional banking. Computers are agnostic but banks are not so if banks keep enabling criminals who is at fault ?
16,A huge humanitarian crisis is forming in Ukraine. 3-5 million people could flee. Unseen since WWII source https://t.co/mqM1DCCWYy

18,It’s a dangerous night for the world. Keeping the Ukrainian people in my thoughts.

20,Come chat on the weekend! Our first meet up. #famorie  https://t.co/6hgyPW7sOo
21,@_KindSir @cryptomoonshot2 @kieran_eth 😂
22,I went to a #bitcoin conference - block value is dead. https://t.co/Vx1NEhhQ5N
23,"@cryptomoonshot2 @_KindSir @kieran_eth Right on. Would love to meet you, I think Kieran may be an eccentric elitist because he just blocked me for replying to his post. Not sure what I did. Take note. Guess it’s really like Robinhood. Shit comms. Lost a customer."
24,@AveragePunksNFT Well yea glad mine got sold. Thanks for picking it up. Just saying - Very unhealthy concentration of ownership if you ask me 674 owners and 4200 nfts. Seems a bit suspicious 🤨?
25,Maryland drivers can shut down a highway in no time. Without a protest goal. Canada should use them instead of truckers.

28,RT @sassal0x: Please shill me the best talks from ETHDenver with links to them on YouTube
29,@sassal0x @lex_DAO can we contribute here? I think so…
30,@jvke_eth @Cosmodinos Yes 🙌
31,@kieran_eth Weird. Crypto pple in my experience are usually really polite and nice.
32,@rj Also dope Cosmo! 💜
33,"@rj Agree. But I also wonder if anyone is working on new stuff on btc, after the block wars it’s just got crazy. People hunkered down and it’s been silent. It’s ok to call that out. While eth has been booming with innovation."
34,@NickJRishwain @mccallios They never explained that it was a DAO or what a DAO was. Biggest failure.
35,@NickJRishwain @mccallios I know just messing around. I agree. It really did. I poked around the forums a bit - a mess really. Low turnout and they r just getting their feet wet. Wish the best but man it fizzled out.
36,@mccallios @NickJRishwain Im off to bed see you at 3am
37,@mccallios @NickJRishwain $sos is a coin and DAO nick Gettahere. https://t.co/vRtrfJgHNg
38,@mccallios Thanks for being honest! I think we r also at that point now. 3 and 6 am wakeups are the norm. Even if the baby is not crying. Weird ?
39,@mccallios I don’t sleep much since I had a baby so I am basically constantly insane. I got a 5 month old. Have problems reading tweets lol.
40,@mccallios Ok reading too much into this forget everything I said
41,@mccallios I’m going to retract that I think i know what u meant. It “could” be used in the future. Right ? But anything could. I mean I got lextokens from long ago saying it’s a risk on etherscan. The moral here is don’t use your hot wallet for cold storage…
42,@mccallios Really think it’s related to the recent phishing scandal?
43,So is 🆘 dead? Everyone was so hyped? Let’s mint on sos they said? It’s the future. You got to nurture your vampire drop. Like a baby.
44,@CryptoNFT_Ave Bout sums it up.
