25,@ivan_bezdomny @punk9059 Yeah for sure. Still early on that front - may not even be required. Seems like a lot of the most successful p2e games now are more defi than game lol
26,"@ivan_bezdomny @punk9059 All speculation at this point. But main thoughts:

- can provide a way to get brand access to merch drops/IRL events/etc
- possible p2e component (v likely imo) 

Also likely $ape is emitted via staking apes/mutants etc"
