21,"@KarenSperling @manifoldxyz @withFND foundation is great because of their auctions and the interface looks really nice. it is more expensive to mint and sell there though. you pay extra gas for escrow, and the platform fees are higher."
22,"@KarenSperling @manifoldxyz my favourite options for minting are manifold and @withFND. if you mint with manifold you can sell the art on opensea or any open platform afterwards. it’s the most universal, and better for establishing something that is long term since the art isn’t tied to a platform."
23,@IIIXIIIIIX 🤍🙏🏻🤍
24,"@KarenSperling @manifoldxyz no, wait until it asks you to put the transaction through. and make sure your wallet is set to the ethereum main network. 

still, i don’t recommend minting on opensea or rarible at all anyways, so if the universe is trying to dissuade you i’d definitely listen 🙏🏻 https://t.co/ndf7mObaBC"

30,"to change anything in the world, we must first change within. this is what i focus on during times like these. what could i heal inside myself to create more peace and compassion on earth? it’s easy to judge. it’s not as easy to take an honest look at ourselves."
31,@tiffatronn good luck! 🙏🏻💛🌸
32,"@KarenSperling @opensea @rarible @manifoldxyz yes, though most people don’t use it so that’s very strange! highly recommend manifold though 🙏🏻"
33,"@KarenSperling @opensea @rarible i would personally recommend using tezos/objkt over polygon if you want a low-cost option, as there’s there’s not much of a market on polygon for art. there’s a great art community on tez though :)

or eth, with a custom contract by @manifoldxyz"
