6,"When you’re feeling down or upset, lean into supporting others. This was counterintuitive for me; I thought the opposite was more imp to work through difficult moments. 

Being there for others takes your mind off things and reminds you you’re not the center of the universe."

10,"@dwr I hear you. An alternative POV is that IF you have a wallet already, onboarding is much easier. 

Felt this strongly when using @withBackdrop earlier this week. Was nice for them to pre populate all my activity associated with my wallet. 

I’m going back and forth on this 💭"
11,"@ai How do you think developers can solve for defensibility over the long term? 

I’m having a hard time thinking of anything outside of “community ownership through tokens”"

15,"6) Making The Leap

Regardless of your seniority level, it’s a good time to explore web3 companies. @opensea, @hellodapper, @AlchemyPlatform, @usebraintrust, @DuneAnalytics, and @coinbase are all great companies that are hiring."
16,"5) Writing Is Key

Writing allows me to construct my thinking and see if I understand what I am talking about. Writing also helps you with relationship building. It just takes a few influential people to read your writing to get noticed and invited to share your perspective."
17,"4) Ease Of Information Gathering

If you are interested in investing in a project or token, you have a lot of public information you can gather to make that investment. If you are interested in working at a web3 company, you can make a more data-driven decision on your career."
18,"3) Knowledge Flywheels

Raising your hand and saying you're interested in a topic accelerates your learnings. People come to you with questions. Even if you do not know them, you'll go figure it out, share knowledge, which will lead to more folks looking for your guidance."
19,"2) Web3 Paradoxes

If you look deep enough you can see the potential of web3, or you might see the opposite. Just like any new technology (e.g. social media), both can be true. It’s up to the early builders and users to dictate which direction this goes."
20,"1) Wisdom + Enthusiasm = Opportunity

Matching the wisdom from web2 with the enthusiasm of web3 will lead you to a good place. You can get excited, be open-minded, but also be rigorous in your thinking."
21,"It's been a few months since I started writing about web3. 

Since then I've connected with web3 founders, investors, and web2 execs exploring this space. 

Below are a few of those learnings 👇🏽🧵"

40,"Merchants have only been able to accept BTC or ETH in the past. This is too volatile for business owners to use or save. USDC is the US dollar but in cryptocurrency. Once you purchase USDC, using the token is faster and easier to use than Venmo, Apple Pay, etc"

Society is noisy and rarely are we silent. Silent with ourselves in reflection, silent when speaking with others, and silent when experiencing nature. Silence is required for listening, and listening is required for learning."
