17,"@Thee_KingDevo @beaniemaxi Exactly. It depends on the jurisdiction and what the contract says. Typically in a private deal buyer keeps the car, and seller can sue for money damages only.  Because of the amount of an Ape, statute of frauds would apply, and the contract must be in writing to be enforceable."
18,"@beaniemaxi If you agree to sell your car and buyer doesn’t pay as agreed that is generally not an illegal criminal act, typically it is civil breach of contract. Even when fraud is involved it is not always criminal (civil fraud). Sometimes they keep the car and the remedy is money judgment"

32,"@j1mmyeth That’s about as helpful as me saying Google copyright law.

Maybe a LL co-founder said in a discord chat the standard NFT license applies to CryptoPunks. Under the law that means nothing.

What’s controlling is the LL T/C, notice they omit the NFT license

https://t.co/xlKTd3AtFA"
33,@j1mmyeth Link the license you say the Punks get.
34,"@j1mmyeth But Punks aren’t NFTs, they are “almost NFTs.” From LL website:

“Are the punks an ERC-721 token?

No. The CryptoPunks pre-date the ERC-721 standard and are a custom contract, that means it doesn't comply with any standards. They are almost an ERC20 token.”"

36,"@nicksdjohnson As a de facto leader in DAO airdrops do you have a link to any resources on best practices (like founder lockups, treasury lockup’s/controls). Obviously ENS serves as one example, but maybe a checklist? If not would you do a spaces to help the community protect itself?"

42,"@ZenLedgerIO I’d like to hear a spaces on this. I don’t think tax liabilities can be forced on people in this fashion.  

Legally if you don’t claim the airdrop, really it’s just an offer, I have never heard of a contractual offer triggering tax liability without acceptance."
43,"@frozone_eth I think it’s supposed to be S.O.S. like the international maritime distress signal when loss of property or life is imminent. It’s a play on words of OpenSea and their plan to go public instead of airdrop the community.

44,"@0xburn_ @0x_hodl @beaniemaxi LL kept 1,000 (10%) of Punks. So if Beanie said that, maybe it is a reference to LL liquidating $30M worth of their Punks in the secondary market."
45,"@0xburn_ @0x_hodl @beaniemaxi Punks IP is valuable today and that value is driven by secondary sales, it has nothing to do with when LL begins to monetize it. The market’s main purpose is to price in future value.

Besides what makes you so sure LL hasn’t already signed licensing agreements for large sums?"
46,"@CapetainTrippy The Metaverse is supposed to be about decentralization and reclaiming ownership. 

Rebranding to Meta is a transparent attempt to own the Metaverse through IP laws and a attack on these values by a company obsessed with owning your content, your data, and your online identity."

60,@BrantlyMillegan @RealAllenHena The official ENS position should be that holding a brand ENS doesn’t stop adoption bc the brands can use their .com’s with ENS.
