87,@CryptoVonDoom Can i catch the loveless train please
88,".. take the game to a whole new level.. think of lamex card, generative NFTs, IRL events, a whole set of ""awesome shit"" that we need lots of $loomi for 😜
#CreepzStrongerTogether @CBCreepz"
89,Another interesting observation is the insistence of treating $loomi as in game currency and not outside the ecosystem.. the upcoming LAMEX card is bearish for $loomi and may see exit of players who were in just for passive income... the real play is whole experience which will .
90,"so what's the effect of all this on gamenomics... you could see a higher burn of $loomi, price may go up if people get the play and start buying up $loomi to spend now, ancillary effect would be mega  will throw up a giga loomi in terms of bribe and may push mega prices upwards"
91,"Hence its pertinent to spin it like there's no tomorrow and garner as many shards, points as possible.. the way it would work is, think of an AI tool to mutate your jpegs like the one attached here.. you can keep mutating, but once you set it , its done and you cannot change.. https://t.co/IoVseNov7g"
92,.. but these points + shards will be much more expensive than spinning the mystery box... think of currently you require 2000 $loomi to get one point if you sacrifice to @CREEPZ_OVERLORD .. so you would need much more $loomi to buy off points later in game
93,"Here's the TLDR of it... the more spins, more points+shards, which would be used to build rare traits of IDL gasless , and here's the catch.. you have only mint 2 per wallet and you can customize it to have bad ass traits by purchasing more points + shards..."
94,"Thanks to @IZADI , he asked a pertinent question that was bothering me, whats the value of spinning more than required.. whats in it for me, why not just do the minimum and conserve $loomi as we dont know the utility of IDL or whether the payoff exists to burn $loomi"
95,My initial strategy was to spin as much as daily loomi yield so that it gets replenished the next day and i can carry forward $loomi to next season.. so was basically conserving $loomi to just generate shards and points daily to take part in raffle... all this changed overnight
96,"Quick recap, you spin the mystery box, collect shards, 1 per week to mint your InterDimensional Lizard (IDL ) .. along with it, you get a chance to win cool prizes and each spin acts as a raffle to win a daily NFT (nearly 1ETH) prize.. all good so far...."
97,Another quick 🧵on the mystery behind the mystery box spin after yesterday's AMA... here's my read of situation and strategy that i will play
