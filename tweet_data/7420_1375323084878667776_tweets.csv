0,Any parent who says they support kids and then hurts other kids so that their child may succeed...YOU are the problem with this #nftkids space. YOU do not represent what this space was built around. YOU parents are a shame to your own children who you pretend to represent.
1,"So I was just informed that a project our kids were involved in from the beginning, our kids just got voted out of the project. We will post a message from our kids soon about this. A message directly to you parents who did this. You know who you are. Shame

2,"Alexa is still looking for the first sale of her new collection. She worked hard on this and has big plans for helping other teens. Could really use some community support. 🙏♥️
#NFTCommunity #nftkids https://t.co/36jtuhEjAa"
3,Her name is Jolynn. She is 8 years old and she deserves a chance. nftkidsmag is bullying and hurting her. Trying to exclude her. Please stop this absurd hate #nftkids community stand up against the division being sowed by nftkidsmag and the parents with them. https://t.co/5rt0svSoMx
4,The chat history we have with nftkidsmag. Blocked w/o explanation after this. Never given a chance. Kids never allowed to participate in events with other kids. It's called bullying by exclusion and it's not ok. nftkidsmag has caused real harm to kids. That needs to be said. https://t.co/QMMOD5gdxP
5,"We have never blocked any other kid or family, only called for #AllKidsDeserveAChance.
We are ganged up on, bullied, and cancelled. Yes the bullies have the bigger voice and audience, so our kids name and health suffer. Innocent kids. Hurt by parents in this community. Shameful"
6,Blocked from #NFTChildrensDay '21 by Latoya and nftkidsmag. Left off intentionally the kids calendars by nftkidsmag. Kicked and blocked from LNL discord the day our daughter submitted a piece for the banner contest. Daughter featured on current KotBC banner but blocked on discord

13,THIS is beautiful! Love this idea and everything it supports. @tezos is a great chain with a growing supportive community. ♥️♥️♥️ https://t.co/Dw3B2v9jHj
14,@MMWYPcom Thank you. Retweets help and supporting any initiatives that build ALL kids up no matter their abilities or background. It is very important to remember kids mental health in everything we do.
15,"@MMWYPcom They are a belittling group that garekeeps kids opportunities based on their inherent racist views. 
#AllKidsDeserveAChance including these youngsters despite their Hispanic background. 
Claira from nftkidsmag is very unhealthy for the future of this space involving kids. https://t.co/lV9bUyEvLq"
16,"It can feel like standing alone on an island sometimes but if you know you are standing up for what is right, you never back down. My kids have experienced bullying and racism. My wife has badly. I will protest nftkidsmag till the day I die. This is a promise."
17,Some #NFTKidsWeAreTheFuture but not if nftkidsmag says they don't like you. Those kids aren't the future.
18,It's kinda obvious when someone omits the Hispanic part of your name and purposely mis spells your name that they care very little about you or your heritage. Nftkidsmag is racist and hateful. They have created a divide in the community and everyone should stand against them https://t.co/Z6Biprfzd0
19,And she blocked us again. Right after I said this was a great thing and I looked forward to the future. This is not how kids community should be built and I urge the #nftkids community to speak up. Our kids are now shut out of this part of the community. This is harmful to kids https://t.co/hIT2Td4Y27
20,@nftkidsmag And my kids do the creating. I'll tell them you said to keep creating. Thank you.
21,@nftkidsmag Never once harassed anyone. Only public calls to unblock and involve all kids. Had to be public because you blocked us without ever giving us a chance.
22,"@nftkidsmag You do realize that by blocking us, you keep my kids out of all group twitter talks, keep them out of the big generative project kids group, keep them off your kids calenders, and out of any other opportunities you are giving other kids?"
23,@nftkidsmag You are trying to build something for the future involving kids but you block kids the first time you disagree with a parent? Never give a chance to them?
24,"@nftkidsmag You mean you won't involve my kids? This is an account for my kids, to protect my kids. My kids have been preyed on by online sexual predators, have been bullied, and have had ACTUAL harassment. This is an account for our family."
25,"First 4 pieces of Alexa's ""Teens Like Me"" collection have now been released. Piece #2 was donated already but the other 3 are available. Thanks for looking.

26,"Woohoo finally unblocked! While I disagree on some of the facts and could defend us more, this is a great time to bury the past and move on. As long as @nftkidsmag includes all kids without discrimination in their vision, this could be a great start to a great future for kids! https://t.co/vp32T5h6Gl"
27,"@nftkidsmag And yes, if it involves my kids and their opportunities in life, I will NEVER let it go. That's something you should know about me, Joe, the dad. I will never ever give up."
28,"@nftkidsmag It's the Carrillo-McCabe's but thank you for finally unblocking us. Hopefully this is a start of a resolution and unity. Everyone says the metaverse is big enough for everyone but the more people who work together, the better the future will be for our kids."
29,#sad tonight. Some things will never change. Feeling I really have let my kids down. Want to tell them to never give up but I'm ready to give up. So hard to put on a good dad face when you are hurting.

40,"@Dad_And_KidsNFT Eric is doing better. Was a stomach bug I think.

Nylas mom and nftkidsmag are still racist homophobic parents who never give some kids a chance and have no problem hurting families."
41,"@TradingFemale Agreed. Unless they are young minority girls like my own who have been blocked and cancelled by nftkidsmag and Nyla Hayes mom since last summer, causing extreme pain, embarrassment, and hurting their opportunities in this space. Too painful to recommend NFT'S anymore to girls."
42,"Here is the ""Kid Pride"" Gallery our girls released last year for pride month 2021. The girls pride art work is within the gallery. Released proudly despite the hatred and blocking we experienced soon after by members of the #nftkids community.

43,@nikosdino Ask nftkidsmag! They blocked our kids and never gave them a chance since last summer. Ask Latoya Hayes why she turned a community against us! Ask these parents why they are full of hate and have no problem hurting kids!
44,"@Dad_And_KidsNFT Well I had surgery this week, my 3 year old is sick, we are currently in a blizzard, and both my girls are cancelled by a large number of the #nftkids community due to some parents pettiness and hate, so it's been a bit of a rough week. Other than that we are thriving! ♥️"

55,3/5 at school. Jolynn is a sensitive soul and sometimes she needs a little extra love and encouragement. Her family helped show how special her art is and Jo kept practicing.
