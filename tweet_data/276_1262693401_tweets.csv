72,"If your beloved project has gone 5-10x in the past few weeks and you think it would be great to see it go another 1.5-2x from here in the next few weeks, you’re wrong. 

Steady, incremental growth over monthly timeframes (at most) is what you really want. 

Otherwise flip now."
73,@ryancarson @Coinbase_NFT Coinbase participants would be mainly US-based. Does this thesis account for potential (and likely) new liquidity entering this year from a global perspective?  I expect NFT accessibility and adoption might distribute crashes temporally/locally and will be less severe than 2019.

89,@ShrewdCharlie Well they can try “but derivatives make the original more valuable” with the original artist (Amanda) and see how well it goes.
90,@NotTheDrPhil 💯 I agree these will do well in time. But I’m not going to tie up my ETH waiting when I can use it now to continue to build. And I will gladly buy in higher at a later point if and when it starts to gain traction.
91,@Elimy_GM 💯
92,"@NotTheDrPhil Oh damn. Makes sense why some large accounts that have massive ArtBlocks holdings are using these arguments to get attention back to their bags. 

I mean it makes sense but in 10 years even yetis would be considered an historical NFT by definition."
93,@saintsonso @NotTheDrPhil Oh I’ve definitely been that guy before. Let’s hope he minted that Fidenza. 🤝
94,@NotTheDrPhil Ouch. Someone needed some liquidity quick.
95,@TheCryptK33per They can buy a 1/1 if the 1/1 has a low entry price. Then the most likely way for that artist’s work to grow in value is that a highly prominent collector’s account buys another piece of art from that artist. Growing wealth in this way is very difficult for the average person.
96,I get CdM's argument but the majority cannot buy an XCopy 1/1 or a Fidenza. The most proven way to build wealth quickly is to flip pfps--some of which will replace BAYC. This trend will continue until we are mainstream &amp; the real masses establish their identity &amp; community. https://t.co/FyEKL6C2PW
