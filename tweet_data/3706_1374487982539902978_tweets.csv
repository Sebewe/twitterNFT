9,"While there is artistic value in voxel based art and it can be beautiful. Not everything needs to be voxels. 
Most of the time it just looks worse.
Like if you convert an image to pixel art, it's not gonna have the same appeal as true pixel art"

27,"Nft games starting to feel like kickstarter.
People with little to no experience thinking games are easy to make. Unrealistic roadmaps and too much hype.
