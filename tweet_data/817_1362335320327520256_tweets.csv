38,"@tmagled @doodles I'm pretty conflicted on this one, because if you own an asset worth $30,000 you should understand what you have and how it works before doing anything with it at all. Then it's also not the buyers fault for taking that opportunity, but something about it still feels wrong"
39,"@tw1tte7 @Gfunkera86 I think PV putting out a final statement with transactions and all that as well as what can legally be disclosed in a tweet would be beneficial. Right now when you search ""Beanie"" for PV tweets the last tweet you see is ""update coming soon"", and I see updates in discord, not twit"

48,"@0xHelix @smems_ Then I genuinely apologize my man, I've been dealing with so many scammer sympathizers and shit the last day or two that I mistook your tone and misplaced my aggression for those people onto you thinking you were one of them. Again genuinely apologize for that"
49,"@0xHelix @smems_ and who do I think I am? Who tf you think you are coming in here telling me to ignore it and coming at me because how dare I question projects? Like cmon man, I'm tired of this out of sight out of mind bs

Unless I'm reading your tone completely wrong, in which case I apologize."
50,"@0xHelix @smems_ Ignoring problems and not questioning them in this space because people/projects ""have a track record"" is just stupid and how we have such a problem with influencers and project leads who STILL pull are accepted in this space because ""They have proven track records"""

97,"@BravoBravo_NFT Tell me about it brother, I'm so sick of this bullshit"
98,"@LUVVVIT They all publicly claim to have cut ties with him after everything came out to save face, but he claims this isn't the case apparently, so I think the public deserve the clear truth and to know who's lying and who isn't"
99,"@Cryptolocity If he's still a part of PV then that is a huge issue as they claim to have cut all ties and bought all his assets to cut him from the company completely, but here he's claiming that they didn't cut ties with him. So someone is lying about his involvement in PV at the moment"
