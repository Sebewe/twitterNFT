11,"@JaimeMusings I was deployed to Afghanistan in 2011 to a base called “Red Hill”, named after destroyed Russian tanks that littered the hills next to the base and mountains that surround it. Russians were killed there decades earlier in those same tanks. A lot of history there as you mentioned https://t.co/oRdRg2jvGY"
12,@JaimeMusings It wasn’t Afghani’s fighting off the US in the 2000’s it was the Taliban (also Taliban vs Russia in the 80’s) but I’d place this Ukrainian resistance up there with the Taliban holding off Russia in the 1980’s for sure. Russia taking L’s.
13,Would there be a cooler david vs Goliath story if Ukraine could fend off Russian advances? Send them back with tail between their legs? Seeing their president and political leaders ready to make contact with the enemy has me wanting to run through a brick wall

36,"Everyone loves when an NFT does a 100x. There’s also NFTs with utility, benefits, and access to exclusive items with no intention to do a 100x. And that’s 100% ok and more and more brands should get into the NFT game with same mindset. @fuegofriends_ is one of the first IMO."
37,"@apestreetapes hi sir. Could you DM me? Wanted to chat about parcel -57, 190"
38,@SirLemuel Yep understood. I’m just thinking folks should consider setting up another ETH address on their hardware wallet and sending any potentially compromised NFTs to the new address.
39,"@SirLemuel When you sign/authorize, is it done at the wallet level? I.e. if you sign a transaction is the authorization specific to that ETH address? Or would signing for 1 ETH wallet on a hardware wallet then make all other ETH addresses on that same hardware wallet vulnerable?"
40,@SirLemuel Understood thanks!
