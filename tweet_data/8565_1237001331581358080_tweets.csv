9,"@NFTtheft @nftworldsNFT @PlanetMinecraft You’re not buying the artwork here, you’re paying for staking of the NFT and the passive income it yields, including the plugins provided by NFTworld, the “artwork” is just whatever people decide to put in it and most are free and doesn’t give the map any value."

40,"@Gr0wCrypt0 @exitliquidity1 @EpiSom3 @nftworldsNFT @TheSandboxGame And it’s a great concept, I just keep seeing post trying to portrait NFTworlds like it’s an actual standalone game, and I just think that’s weird. 😅"
41,"@exitliquidity1 @EpiSom3 @nftworldsNFT @TheSandboxGame That’s not a fair comparison, most of those metrics are yet to be implemented in nftworlds, not to mention that nftworld is just an addon built upon Minecraft, a game almost 10 years in the making, while the others are completely standalone games."

72,@_3volve_ @the_x2y2 The dev said that's impossible since the contract has been deployed.
73,"@_3volve_ @the_x2y2 And with the contract issue where people lost gas while claiming I understand them pausing, not really sure what they should have done different. They can't pause staking either as it's already deployed."
74,"@_3volve_ @the_x2y2 Listed some low-medium tier NFTs to be eligble, still I understand that they don't want crap on their platform, so that they actually get real volume for the free tokens they are giving away."
75,"@_3volve_ @the_x2y2 Can you blame them for wanting quality NFTs on their platform instead of people listing their ""hidden folder""? It's a FREE airdrop after all. If you don't like it, don't bother claiming"
