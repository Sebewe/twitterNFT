38,@pixelsbyeryc thank you thank you :)
39,"Lastly, edit your record and paste the address of the Wallet you want to use with the Subdomain.

Then click ""Confirm"" down below. This will be the 3rd and final transaction. In total, with current gas, this should cost $30 ish USD to set up. https://t.co/7ajO9YlYgF"
40,"Once everything is successful, disconnect from ENS, then connect it with the wallet w/ the address you just sent it to (i.e your L3dger wallet etc).

Send a little bit of ETH to that wallet, this one should be around the same price as the last two actions ($10 USD at 30 Gwei) https://t.co/Fo7nsIT6tB"
41,"click on the Subdomain, then edit the “Controller” field to the address you want it to redirect to, then press “Set” 

I believe this will also charge a gas fee at around the same price. https://t.co/qal3GZImrH"
42,"click on the .eth name you want to add a subdomain, go to the Subdomains tab, then click Add Subdomain.

This will charge a gas fee (around $10 USD rn) https://t.co/l6NNYIVmVU"
43,"subdomains of your .eth username lets you use variants of it for multiple addresses 

super helpful if you own multiple wallets, or if you want to give one to someone you know

gas is super low rn so this can all be done for under $50 ea

a visual guide// https://t.co/ZlgQUvGddX"
44,"@JrRmack so for .eth subdomains, i basically used this article and went to the subdomains section https://t.co/DyGJ31MjOg

I'll see if i can do a better visual guide quickly before gas goes up 👀"
45,"gas fees r so low so i took the time to set a few subdomains such as 

vault.kyoshi.eth
hot.kyoshi.eth

no more panicking when sending stuff to my other wallets 😌"
46,it's super easy to read too!
47,"for anyone more interested in keeping your tokens and jpegs safe, i really recommend reading this article from @bee_sec_san, someone i admire for going out of their way to in teaching the coven about security instead of just saying ""get a ledger"" 

https://t.co/Lqip1uRPfk"
48,@bee_sec_san i love this!
49,@elliottaleksndr Thank you! It's still a few months away but this random memory popped up in my head yesterday 😂
50,@bee_sec_san yes!!!
51,"before COVID, for 3 birthdays in a row I celebrated by taking a trip to Costco and just eating all of their free samples and then finishing with a pizza"
52,just know I’m even more excited about this after today 👀
53,"also noticing it doesn't play nicely with sites like OS 😅

so in these cases, connecting with L*dger Live and 🦊 with L*dger are better if you want to have a safer web3 experience than just 🦊 by itself"
54,"the downside is that this clearly isn't meant for a wallet used for trading.

there's also a cost in activating the Vault + adding Guardians. Adding a Guardian that isn't your number or email will cost you $20-$30 each in gas fees and activating the Vault will be around $60-$80"
55,"Because multiple devices/people are needed to transfer your NFTs out, the likelihood of those NFTs being transferred out by someone else is incredibly low."
56,"a Guardian can be anyone/anything you trust. Some examples include your email, your number, a friend or family member you trust, your L*dger wallet, your M*tam*sk wallet, etc."
57,"so what makes @argentHQ's Argent Vault one of the most secure places to store your high-value NFTs? 

Guardians. Your JPEGs aren't moving out of your wallet unless it is approved by your Guardians."
58,@Oldking_eth that looks soo goood!
59,@pixelsbyeryc Definitely! I can write a very brief and simplified thread on how Argent Vault works 🙂
60,"@replicode_eth to add on to it, I was also talking to potential nft trader scammers through discord dms  (in order to gain any evidence, if any, that they were scammers) 😅 

im very cautious so I’d rather them talk to me than to someone unfamiliar with the scams"
61,"lastly the latest thing I added was activating my Argent Vault

Argent uses Guardians, which can be people you trust, your contact info, and other wallets you may have, to approve actions

Nothing goes out of this until the majority or all of your Guardians approve the action. https://t.co/mIz602YVb5"
62,"hardware wallets are kept offline. safer than a hot wallet, but are still a single point of failure

i bought a l*dger to connect use with w*lletconnect/m*tam*sk for token-gated sites i trust and to act as a ""guardian"", basically to get best of both worlds https://t.co/999B2V3OrT"
63,"if you're familiar with 2FA and authenticator apps, security keys are basically the physical version of it.

2FA via SMS is the weakest, apps are stronger but rely on you never losing your device, and the physical key is the strongest just because the hacker would NEED it https://t.co/S96BGxXsKS"
64,"been super curious about digital security lately thanks to someone in the coven, esp w/ my digital accounts + crypto assets

in short, the easiest ways to massively upgrade your security is getting a:
- security key (physical 2FA)
- hardware wallet
- argent wallet"
65,i thought you said fudgible https://t.co/KMPRTx4QVi
66,life* omg
67,phew im no longer living live on the edge and keeping everything on my hot wallet
68,"@hey_alemakes @juujuumama @useGALLERY @crypto_coven as long as you own a WITCH, you will be able to mint it 🙂

A snapshot is basically them keeping a record of every address that owns a WITCH at a certain time. Those addresses will be able to mint tomorrow."

72,adding a smiley face :-) when giving feedback cause I feel being direct it might sound harsh
73,@ladidaix and you will!!
74,@mensaisliterate yesssss 👀
75,the urge to spoil what this means 😂
76,"a helpful tip i learned from somewhere: 

before sending to a new address (such as to a cold wallet), it never hurts to send a small amount of ETH or an NFT you don’t mind losing (like a Zorb) just to make sure everything is working smoothly."
77,@juniverse_nft sending good luck! that was basically what happened with the one in my pfp :)

criteria:
- excellent ux
- excellent customer experience (so that it's not tech-heavy)"
86,googling how to make my own etf
87,like 97% of my investment decisions when it comes to investing into stocks or crypto are based off how polished the experience is 💀
88,"great projects can have anonymous creators.

bad projects can have ""doxxed"" creators.

repeating the statement: there are valid reasons to stay anonymous on the internet. https://t.co/iccjVuKE2f"
89,@Oldking_eth thank you i really appreciate it 💛
90,@llpresswell tbh 💀it's good and all and i love everything they're exploring but yeah I'm like is this S3???
91,"sorta overwhelmed with everything since i thought I could handle it all but I'm human n have my limits, not a machine

but! I'm grateful I identified my feelings and what was causing it"
92,the urge to sell everything and take a long break from work
93,"always have to remind myself when im in a design block, i need to create bad things in order to create good things"
94,"People love supporting people they know and care about in any way possible. 

Take the time to be a part of the community (genuinely, so do this with one you truly vibe with)."
95,"I know it’s exciting to share what you’ve been working on, and it can be difficult to get the word out.

But it can come off as you’re only here to promote. Like, that you’re not interested in being part of the community at all.

Nobody likes an ad being thrown at them."
96,"pssst, don't join a server and immediately shill about something you've been working on"
97,"also this (even tho its a meme to say kyoshi was a hero that didn't see peace as an option towards enemies💀 )

creds to @ladygrey1111 for making this sticker of my witch to use in the coven 💛 https://t.co/qq5dzK3fJu"
98,"the more i read about kyoshi, the more I find similarities with her.

she was different and shy at first, but grew up to be more confident and embrace her differences (reminds me a lot of me accepting and embracing my autism)"
99,"(most) usernames are personal and can reveal a lot about someone

I love that those that ask about my username always bring up if I watched avatar: the last airbender. avatar is literally my fav thing in the entire world, and a show that helped me navigate the game called life"
