41,"We can live in harmony with technology without becoming slaves to our own creations. These technologies are suppose to be enhancements to the things in our lives, not replacements for them. 

/end for now"
42,The further down we go on this road the deeper the sleepwalking state will be until we all end up like the abominations in Wall-E. As an ex World of Warcraft addict I promise you that you'll find nothing but a sense of hollow meaningless when you give yourself over to a VR.
43,Has become boring to such an extent that kids need to distract themselves from it while physically pedaling the damn thing forward. This state of being is what I feel is being preyed upon by those who are selling you the lie that is the current marketed version of the metaverse.
44,Any zoomers reading this can feel free to call my 26 year old ass a boomer but I feel this dual wielding handle bar &amp; phone technique is peak manifestation of how out of touch our culture is with reality. So out of touch that the act of bike riding
45,🧵 I live on an isle that many teenagers also call home. Every day I see 1 or more riding their bikes &amp; I've become acutely aware of a peculiarity about these bike riding teenagers. They're almost always on their cellphones looking down.......while riding a bike??
46,@jaimedelpizz0 Apparently a modern western human processes more information in a single day than the average person did in a lifetime a couple hundred years ago. We're living in a state of constant information overload. It's crucial to unplug otherwise one's mental acuity will deteriorate.
47,"@QuantumNFT It's stopped me from releasing work I'd prefer to show the world, unfortunately. Scarcity is important to maintain &amp; at the moment I'm overleveraged. But I've shot every day for the past 2 weeks, it's been great. I'll keep creating with or without NFTs being involved 📸"
48,"@pain_and_pixels I feel you on this. It wasn't until somewhat recently that I encountered such feelings for the first time since being a photographer. I've always created simply for its own sake but for a moment the NFT rat race knocked me out of alignment. It was fleeting tho, thankfully"

57,But it's actually bolstered my conviction that photography &amp; digital art NFTs are really the only sectors in the NFT space where the majority of actors are integrous in nature. I'd love to see some of these people apeing into scams just buy art they like instead.
58,Something like 95%+ of recent NFT launches have been rugs/scams. @Pixelmon is just the tip of the iceberg of what's been happening for all of 2022. There's always been &amp; always will be scams in crypto but the level of theft occuring here this year is absurd.
