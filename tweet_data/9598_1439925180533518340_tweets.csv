1,"@Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @ETH_Guy51 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII Haha mate, let’s leave it. 
Wish you all the best in whatever your doing. Let’s not get sucked into this back and forth. 👊🏽"
2,"@Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @ETH_Guy51 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII No problem, and for your records I too am a small holder of lions I only have 90 lions and 90 bungalows across multiple wallets, but I’ve forgot about most of them, too busy crushing irl stuff. You know how it is right."
3,"@Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @ETH_Guy51 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII Mate, your 60 years old. Stop thinking your billy big bollocks. I’ve told you that’s fine, we’ve agreed to disagree now you keep coming back saying you’ve got this and you’ve got that? I genuinely don’t give a fuck if you have a real gold pig mate."
4,"@Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @ETH_Guy51 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII That’s fine, you crack on crushing whatever your crushing."
5,"@ETH_Guy51 @Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII Appreciate your reply 🤴 
Like I said, genuinely hope they spin it around and it all comes good in the end and this was just a minor blip in their project!"
6,@Lew_Langer @ETH_Guy51 @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII Okay let’s leave it there as this is going nowhere is it..
7,"@Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @ETH_Guy51 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII Well if your twice my age, at least, why has a 60+ year old on Twitter with kids with a cartoon profile pic?"
8,"@ETH_Guy51 @Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII And I wish them well with that and the project.
Let’s just agree to disagree.
I’m not ‘hating’ I’m just saying they had a flaw in the project, which okay now they are addressing, would they have told you about it if nobody found it first?"
9,"@Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @ETH_Guy51 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII We was discussing until you started saying ‘I’ve forgot more than you know’ 
Good luck to you aswel."
10,"@Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @ETH_Guy51 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII Your blowing this waaaaaay out of proportion, I’m just giving my opinion on a project, if you don’t agree that’s fine. Why your talking about your bags I’ll never know as nobody has questions what you’ve got, nor do I care what you have. Go outside lad, you need some fresh air."
11,"@Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @ETH_Guy51 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII I do want CC to turn this around however, I’d genuinely prefer I was wrong about them."
12,"@Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @ETH_Guy51 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII If you believe that’s the best play for you, then so be it. You do you. I’ve held CC recently and I also held it in November. I liked the space, but you can’t just sweep what’s happened under the carpet and pretend it’s not happened right?"
13,"@Lew_Langer @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks @DDish123 @ETH_Guy51 @def_leopard0 @SchneiderIII What’s your views?
That’s just my opinion? You think everyone in a project all have the exact same opinions on different projects?"
14,Imagine having WL for invisible friends now.
15,Why is there an @InvsbleFriends at 500 eth on a Dutch auction haha. Wow.
16,"@ch3rry__moon @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks Correct, but it doesn’t take a genius to see which was inspired and which was copied.
I’m want every project to succeed, I’m not trying to fud anything, I’m just saying, it doesn’t look good in a market where the community are savage and unforgiving."
17,@ch3rry__moon @3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks What’ve they compensated her? Is it in the millions?
18,"@3DLNY3 @NFTCryptoChicks Anyone still speaking positively is holding a bag. That’s it. 
Until they fully support the original artist and heavily compensate her. They’re done."

30,"@JayhawkNFT If you offered me one now, truthfully, I’d take the MAYC, however, ROI wise, NFTWORLDS win."
31,"@YoshiJoshi_ @skuxxverse I’m in @skuxxverse 
3x already.
NFT WORLDS aren’t even close to done. They still got 3x yet."
32,"@AndrewBitcoin @pixels_online They are, was speaking to @nftkal about these the other day, I ended up getting @skuxxverse instead. However, bullish on @pixels_online also."
