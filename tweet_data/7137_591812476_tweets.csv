26,I'm so confused. OS says that none of the pixelmon have hatched. But I'm seeing the hot mess on twitter.
27,@nftsewsh @bigdomepiece06 How did you find this out? My MetaMask was drained of 8.1 eth back in January but they left all of my NFTs. I've looked at everything I can find on etherscan but still haven't solved the problem. However two token IDs had unlimited access they were saitanamu and puzlpunks.

52,Wanted to be a part of that. Just do everyone a favor and go look at the activity. We can all see who swooped in and undercut when the floor was steady rising. And now look...activity has slowed because we can all see that yet another group of people messed a good thing up.
53,Instead of doing a little homework you undercut what you thought the floor was. So when we were really at 4.2 and climbing you listed for 3.98...because the floor still showed 3.99 and up even though they had sold. People were buying because they saw the floor rising and they
54,Of 3.9 it was really 4.2 and climbing. But the floor still showed several NFTs that had already sold. If you would have clicked on each NFT listed by lowest price you would have realized that most of the top row had already sold so therefore the floor was really much higher. But
55,@GooniezNFT you guys were on liftoff mode. Your floor could have been over 1e right now but the impatient paperhands messed that up. Paperhands do everyone a favor and go on OS and look at the activity. People were buying so fast that OS was lagging. So if OS showed a floor price
