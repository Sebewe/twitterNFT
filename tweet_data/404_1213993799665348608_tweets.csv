19,"@CryptoCryze @PuffYatty I can’t say it’s a guarantee, as everything in this space is a gamble, but I would say it is out performing everything in the market and I don’t see signs of it slowing down any time soon."
20,@CryptoCryze @PuffYatty All personal opinion of course
21,"@CryptoCryze @PuffYatty Based on what I’ve seen since being in the space, the BAYC is almost held to a different standard. Almost everybody has a goal of “buy an ape” one day. The floor has been consistently increasing, you see more and more media coverage of it every day, each day a new celeb joins"
22,"@PuffYatty Safest bet is BAYC.
Higher risk higher reward plays would be either Cryptomories, CoolCats, KaijuKings, Doodles, Creepz, VEEFRIENDS, Cyberkongs, crypto chicks, or anything other blue chip"

45,"It’s not about the price of ETH or the floor of your newest NFT, it’s about the mindset you have when you buy or sell. Take a deep breathe and think about what a logical approach would be. Patience is key in this space🙏🏼"
46,"@itstylersays Don’t liquidate now though you’ll lose more.,hold your NFT’s but you can convert usd and buy that at the dip."
47,Who wants tweets about NFT’s and  Motivation??
48,@itstylersays Why would you buy high and sell low? Patience my friend. It will come back. Patience is key in this business 🙏🏼
49,Self awareness is being able to deduce that you fear what you’re doing because you KNOW you will succeed. Who fears success you ask? You’d be surprised to find that most people do…
