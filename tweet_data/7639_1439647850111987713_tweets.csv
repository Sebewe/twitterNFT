23,@sayinshallah I hated running until my friend explained the mental place you go to on really long runs. I wanted to try it for myself and fell in love w running asa result.
24,"@sayinshallah maybe a novel pursuit then? Like:
-mobility
-Olympic weightlifting (i.e. snatching)
-Yoga
-road biking
-ultra running
etc.

I've found I can commit easier to fitness if I occasionally switch up the end goal. 
OR stop working out for your body entirely, and work out for your mind."

32,"@NFTethics Contract is legit. Legit connections. Incredibly low number of bans (just over 300 out of 41,000).

I do think this is fertile ground to discuss what = a red flag and when a project is actually a scam. 

Have you considered publishing 'standards' and inviting community input?"
33,"@NFTethics Hey Team—I appreciate the work you do, and where you're coming from.

I think in this case you're wrong though. But this does bring up some good points about issues that NFT projects should address to imbue more credibility."
