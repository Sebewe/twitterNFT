24,@NFTDiverge @ForkinThRoad @ForkinThRoad That is what got me confused. How does merch bring value to actual NFT? I would see it as once it is a brand then merch would not stay on the shelves and increase exposure.

33,@NFTswithNate Exactly. You as well fam 🙏
34,"@NFTswithNate I am already all in as you can see so whatever happens, we will flow with it. It was just interesting to me and wanted to see what the rest of the fam is thinking. I don't make assumptions and that is why I ask questions. Have a fantastic Sunday fam 🙏"
35,@paddypensaru I totally agree but I just was contemplating the timing of it. That’s all. Brand recognition is much easier when the space is already a household name.Merch than becomes a must have which will put the space to another level. Do you know when did from mint day BAYC get into merch?
36,@NFTann3r @InvsbleFriends So happy for you fam. Happy Sunday 🙏🏻
37,@NFTsAndWine Of course.I understand this method has worked before for other brands and that’s why probably he is choosing this route but we are an NFT brand first and foremost. Merchs are another avenue to introduce people to the NFT.
38,@NFTswithNate Juggling too many things at the same time scare me honestly. It usually doesn’t work in business aspect of the world. Past 5-10 years the idea of limited supply has gained grounds.Let’s see what happens.

41,@DAVEvsAXIE @BoardApes @quirkiesnft Just wanted to say ty for your time yesterday. I hope we get more insight soon. Have a fantastic Sunday brother 🙏🏻
42,"@SickFriendSmurf This is all marketing tools. No doubt he is great at whah he does but as he mentioned previously, momentum is key and as a small share holder, I like to know as I was not lucky enough to sit on $50k profits already. I am paying 9 eth a set. Not chump change"
43,@SickFriendSmurf Idk that’s why I am asking fam to enlighten me lol. Oh for sure. It is a lifestyle at the end of the day. But Nike didn’t start limited merchs and all these sneaker hype in the first phases.
44,@Robinmane2817 Hmm interesting. So another words a story within a story. Interesting perspective.

51,@THANVEERKRISHN1 I am not unhappy at all fam. Just was curious to see what PA fam was thinking about this. Not a keyboard warrior but an investor. So curious to see and learn what are the best avenues for PA
52,@userbeingreal Collaboration as joining forces to get the message out to more audiences in regards to psychedelics and their benefits
53,@S3Crypto @dogen_hghar Not to pay to endorse but to collaborate as the objective and mission is the same. Mental health and the use if psychedelics instead of prescription drugs. Just an example
54,@THANVEERKRISHN1 Fam I am asking to learn and see everybody else view point as mine didn’t make any sense to me. Brainstorming 🙏🏻💙
55,@THANVEERKRISHN1 This is why I asked to brainstorm to get it lol.
56,@InvestedThug Same here fam. Endless love 🙏🏻
57,@existsintheory So you believe if the merch is fire people will be investing in the NFT part or just the merch side?
58,@JB__nfts Who watches CNN anymore? Lol
59,@userbeingreal Not at all. Not pay ir give free PA’s to anyone. My question is the precious time in the early stages to dedicate to other avenues instead of merch design and manufacturing
60,@InvestedThug Just thinking out loud and wanted get different perspectives. I am not saying he is right or wrong. Just curious to see the general outlook on it
61,@dogen_hghar Sorry for typos
62,@InvestedThug @dogen_hghar Influencer not as celebrities per say but influences who are dedicating time to find avenues for mental help although if you see Eminem for example become a PA holder I am sure the project will become more of a household name
63,@S3Crypto @dogen_hghar Paul Stamets for example who is a mycologiss for example. People who are dedicating time for mental health and advocates for mental help as we speak. Actual household names who have used psychedelics to change their life for example
64,@AJDonzo Don’t disagree with that his vision for a luxury brand is very appealing and appreciate it. My point is NFT’s are time sensation. Why merch now instead of other avenues to get PA recognized than the merch will sell itself
65,@THANVEERKRISHN1 So holders of actual PA NFT’s are in competition with ebay flippers?
66,@userbeingreal Would rather invest in the components and NFT’s or merch? Easy decision right?
67,@userbeingreal Design and manufacturing merch? This is my conundrum
68,@userbeingreal My point exactly. Non of us are. Creating revenue for corp gives more ammunition to deploy to different aspects of business. Totally makes sense. But wld it be wiser to deploy this precious time in early stages to market the NFT into big name holders instead of time spent in
69,@khforh I just feel we can invest our time more wisely at this stage on different avenues than merch this early. That’s all
70,@the_tintin_87 I think I am not making my point clear unfortunately
71,@AJDonzo 100%. That’s not the question at all.
72,@userbeingreal How many BAYC non members buy BAYC merch?
73,@userbeingreal Bottom line for the corporation?
74,@userbeingreal Totally agree with that. All I am asking is it more beneficial at this point in the early stages to focus on merch or is it more prosperous for the PA holders to have a major influencer doing the marketing for it instead of selling us merch which the revenues only create a higher
75,"@dogen_hghar Create revenue for who? Would it also make sense to dedicate the time for creating,designing,manufacturing etc for merch to market this early but instead to find avenues to market the NFT to influential people who will have a huge impact on the nft and later for merch?"
76,@THANVEERKRISHN1 So do you think somebody would buy the merch who is not the holder of the actual NFT?
77,@khforh I totally understand that. I invested because of the vision and the cause. Community is insanely warm hearted and love them. My point is entirely different. How does buying a merch in Q2 is going to upscale the value of the actual NFT and bring value to the holders?
78,@khforh Let’s say you are right. There are less than 10k PA’s. We all buy several merchs. Then what?
79,Can we brainstorm together fam? How does manufacturing merch give any upside to PA holders this early in the game? Would I rather spend my money on the actual nft and it’s component or buy a wearable mask or hoodie per say? I understand merch is important but why this early?
