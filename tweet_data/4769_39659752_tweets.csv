71,@AlexWGomezz Buy from creators you are familiar with and trust and buy shit you actually really love.
72,@_jacklawton_ What are you doing following a digital artist? Do you yell at your tv when you get advertised some bullshit product but keep watching cause there’s nothing else to do? Vote with your money and time and by engaging with this post your only helping @sirmitchell out.
73,"@rotoole No problem. He’s got a lot of info so it may take some time. Let me know if you have any questions, always down to chat with anyone who’s interested in the space."
74,I always enjoy a good argument about digital rights. I can only imagine how stupid I sound as they stare into their digital pocket sized computer. Sorry you gotta deal with this @sirmitchell https://t.co/MZGznOa1RY

76,@rotoole @sirmitchell @punk6529 he’s got a pinned mega thread of all sorts of topics related to web3
77,@JerkQ @sirmitchell If you want some research I can point you in the right direction.
78,@sirmitchell With current events and the way things are headed. People will understand the importance of non-custodial wallets and true ownership that can’t be “deleted” or taken away. People love to hate the “metaverse” but fail to realize we’re already there in a shittier centralized form.
