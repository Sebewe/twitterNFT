17,@staystacced @nbatopshot VR court side seats for team set holders. Trade tickets for team apparel.     People are dropping major coin just for the chance to drop more coin. That’s not fandom.

41,@JamalBackAgain You’re a mini fridge and foreman grill away from perfection
42,"@ActuallyJebBush Agreed, but even the testing of such a utility could have been yearly regular season tickets for team set holders. I just want to see people who use the platform prioritized before vip treatments start getting handed out."
43,"@ActuallyJebBush These experiences should be earned through engagement, not auctioned off to the highest wallet. Sending Suns set holders to the finals last year is a perfect example. But I agree with you that there is much more to come 🤜🏾🤛🏾"
44,@TokerBot @joshgaynor007 Someone’s flipping lol
45,"@ActuallyJebBush I see your point, but where is the connection to fandom is my question. The entire platform was built around real fans and real collectors. I’d much rather see a smaller scale at first that actually rewarded platform users. Not a 1/million giveaway and a 10k+ auction."
46,"@ActuallyJebBush But you literally can buy it, starting at 10k"
47,@jeffwellz “My big brother was Big’s brother”
48,@UFCStrikeNFT What happened to the 12pm update?
49,"@dwasserm @nbatopshot @NBA @roham My thoughts exactly, nothing points to rewarding actual fans, just selling all star tickets 5 years in advance."
50,"@PackripEwing With a $10k starting bid for these and only 1 going to the entire community, why the @nbatopshot tie in? Seems like they just used a years worth of fandom to hype up a cash grab."
